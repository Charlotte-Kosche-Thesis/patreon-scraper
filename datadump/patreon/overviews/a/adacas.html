    "summary": "Hello, my name is Adomas and I\u0027m beginner self taught 3D Artist and Modder. Currently I\u0027m studying Multimedia Technology. Studies take most of my time so right now I rarely get to play around in Zbrush.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I got into 3D modelling.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This hobby of mine began with the launch of Arma 3 Alpha. At the very beginning I started out with texturing available A3 assets. At that point I never actually tried any sort of modding so the start was quite hard and challenging for me. When I got the hand of the texturing I then tried to make use of available A2 assets. This is the point when I got introduced to Blender. From there I was combining different models and making various combinations from those to create something new and unique.\u00a0 As the time passed A2 models weren\u0027t enough for me anymore and I felt that Arma 3 was lacking new content so I started modelling that myself. At first it was long and dreadful experience, but as the time passed and with each new model I got better. Getting the hang of multiple new programs such as (Zbrush, Substance Painter, Topogun, Marvelous Designer) and figuring out a proper workflow for myself costed a lot of time at first. Almost two years have passed since I got into modelling and I have learnt a lot of new things and I\u0027m still learning every day with every different model I do. This is my thing now and I love doing it and I wish to improve even further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
