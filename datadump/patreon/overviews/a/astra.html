    "summary": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page. Chances are that if you wended your way here, you already know who I am. For a quick recap:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Astra Crompton -- a multifaceted storyteller, using \u003ca href=\"http://www.astracrompton.com/illustrations.php\"\u003eillustrations\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.astracrompton.com/novels.php\"\u003enovels \u0026amp; short stories\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.astracrompton.com/comics.php\"\u003ecomics\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://www.astracrompton.com/games.php\"\u003egames\u003c/a\u003e to weave worlds and share adventures. I love to explore my worlds through fashion, \u003ca href=\"http://www.astracrompton.com/cosplay.php\"\u003ecosplay\u003c/a\u003e, music, and even recipes from the different cultures in my flagship project, \u003ca href=\"http://www.astracrompton.com/ul-zaorith.php\"\u003eUl-Zaorith\u003c/a\u003e. I am a proud member of the queer community and make a concerted effort to showcase characters with depth from a pro-LBGT and feminist perspective. For this Patreon, I\u0027ll focus solely on my graphic novels and related illustration work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current comic project is \u003cem\u003eWeaponry\u003c/em\u003e. Going strong for 5 years now, I have completed 5 chapters with weekly updates (Mondays), and there are 5 chapters to go to complete the story. This is a passion-project, and a big part of that passion is you! I love interacting with my readers, so please feel free to comment (I read every one of them and try to reply to as many as possible). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePart of this interaction manifests at the end of each chapter when the readers get to \u003cstrong\u003evote\u003c/strong\u003e on how they want the story to continue. I mock-up 3 options, focusing on each of the three protagonists (Arrow, Blade, and Gun); you vote, and the winning option confirms who will narrate the following chapter, what events will become canon, and what sort of tone the story will take. This collaborative process prevents me from getting too far ahead of myself, and also ensures that I\u0027m telling the story \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e want to read. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow Weaponry here:\u003cbr\u003eTumblr: \u003ca href=\"http://astracrompton.tumblr.com\"\u003eastracrompton.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeviantART: \u003ca href=\"http://tarorae.deviantart.com\"\u003etarorae.deviantart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSmackJeeves: \u003ca href=\"http://weaponry.smackjeeves.com\"\u003ehttp://weaponry.smackjeeves.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/Weaponry-265943563448401\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/Weaponry-265943563448401\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWebsite: \u003ca\u003ewww.astracrompton.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComics Site: \u003ca href=\"http://www.otherworldscomics.com\"\u003ewww.otherworldscomics.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile the comic is shared for free on the various locations above, I also make print copies of each chapter (which you can find on my website). These include the regular colour chapter pages, along with a sepia origin story comic for one of the ten main cast members, bonus illustrations, information about the world and characters, planning sketches, and written vignettes to showcase alternate story options. The sales of these physical copies are so far the only way I have of trying to cover the costs of website maintenance, (hopefully) advertising spots to bring in more readers, and the cost of producing the print books. For 5 years I have been funding Weaponry out of pocket, and that has begun to take its toll.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us to Patreon! My hope is that some of you might choose to pitch in a monthly donation of $1 or $2 to help support this starving artist and her creative dreams. In return for your support, you will receive early access to the comic pages, sneak peeks at bonus content, exclusive wallpapers, and a say in what kind of bonus content goes into the print volumes. You will also (if you choose) be listed in the Acknowledgements page of the print volume as a supporter of \u003cem\u003eWeaponry\u003c/em\u003e. If you have any requests for what you would like to see as perks from my Patreon, please send me a message. I\u0027m new to this, after all, and I want to ensure that your support is rewarded with things you actually want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, I love feedback from my readers, so feel free to message me on any of the platforms listed above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! You are the fuel that enables this flame to burn so brightly!\u003cbr\u003e"
