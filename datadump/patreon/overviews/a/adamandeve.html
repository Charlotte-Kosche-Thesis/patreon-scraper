Their friendship is tested as romance and sex are introduced\ninto the equation for the first time, communication proves difficult, they each want different\nthings from the relationship, insecurities bubble to the surface, feelings are fragile, and they\nrealize that, just because they\u0027re the only people on earth, that doesn\u0027t necessarily mean\nthey\u0027ll want to stay together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a story about faith, relationships, learning to live with God\u0027s silence, and learning to live with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe greatest love story ever almost wasn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a modern married\u00a0producer-director duo making our way through the lone and dreary world of DIY filmmaking and self-distribution, we are very excited about the opportunity of Patreon.
