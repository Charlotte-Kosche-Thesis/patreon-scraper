    "summary": "Patreon exists because of an unfortunate but inescapable truth: creators need money in order to create. I can honestly say I don\u0027t write to make money. I write because I have stories inside my head kicking and screaming to get out. They demand I write them. Really. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a while, I tried writing the stories on the side, while I worked a \"real\" job to make money. That didn\u0027t work out so well. I had no trouble getting a job and making money; that wasn\u0027t the problem. The problem was, I really never could write on the side. Part of that was because I was writing for money too. I had no trouble getting jobs as a technical writer. I wrote manuals for operating systems, for programming languages, for e-commerce software, even for power management systems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories didn\u0027t like that. With my mind tied up on the inner workings of complex software or hardware, it didn\u0027t have the time to develop complex universes, mystical realms, or even interesting plots. The stories didn\u0027t like that one bit. They clamored for attention, causing riots inside my head. It wasn\u0027t at all comfortable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided I had no choice but to give my characters their voices, to share their adventures with the world. But then that money thing came up again. I\u0027ve got a wife and two kids, and all four of us seem to need food and shelter. At the very least, I\u0027ve got to pay the power bill and the internet bill so I can keep writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why I\u0027m here, on Patreon, asking you to appease the voices in my head. If you support me, I\u0027ll use that money to pay the bills so I can keep writing. Your support allows me to share the stories that fill my mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe project I\u0027m working on right now is called Shadow and Light. It\u0027s a story about two young warriors on opposing sides of an ancient conflict. It\u0027s an adventure of love and discovery. And it\u0027s got magic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s the deal: I\u0027m going to write Shadow and Light, and I\u0027m going to put it online for everyone to read. Free. But I\u0027m asking you to help me pay the bills so I don\u0027t have to quit writing and get a stupid job. I\u0027m asking you to believe in the dream. And, for those of you generous enough to help make this all possible, I\u0027ll give you the added bonus of some exclusive insights into the characters and world of Shadow and Light, and just maybe some side-stories exclusive to generous patrons.\u003cbr\u003e"

They come in my dreams, in my moments of quiet, and even in the middle of a conversation. There are all these adventure stories constantly spawning inside my brain.\u003cbr\u003eAfter getting frustrated with the university world, I spent just over a decade as a technical writer. I wrote manuals for complex electronic systems, including operating systems, programming languages, e-commerce software, and even power management hardware. It was good work, and the pay was decent, but still the stories filled my brain.\u003cbr\u003eI got married to an \u003ca href=\"http://riafineart.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eamazing, talented artist\u003c/a\u003e, and we have two amazing daughters. Even more stories built up. I eventually reached the inescapable conclusion that I had to write. It\u0027s more than a job, or even a calling. It\u0027s who I am. It\u0027s what I do.\u003cbr\u003e",
