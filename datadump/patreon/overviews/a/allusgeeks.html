If you do not want to support us through Patreon or if your own circumstances keeps you from being able to help; you can still enjoy the podcasts the exact same way you have been: free of charge and outside of Patreon! We appreciate every listener we have and this Patreon page is just our way of trying to maintain the level of content you expect from All Us Geeks.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Us Geeks has been providing geek-centric content, with a tabletop gaming focus, since 2012. Each year we take a look at what we produce, and what our listeners and guests have to say, in order to provide the best content we can.\u00a0Between behind the scenes software, replacement equipment, and just general monthly fees for things like web and media hosting; our costs have continued to grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where the Patreon page comes in to play. If you have enjoyed our content (Geek News, the main All Us Geeks episodes, The Game of Crowd Funding, YouTube videos, etc...) we would appreciate your support in helping us maintain the current state of All Us Geeks, and allowing us to possibly plan for future improvement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my big passions when it comes to All Us Geeks is the community and helping to promote the community. We have focused on helping many people share their dreams, games, knowledge, and general creativity. It is one of the things that keeps us returning to the microphones every recording session. And now we\u0027re reaching out to that same community to help us keep working to promote everyone\u0027s passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur Milestones break down what we need at each point, from us only focusing on main episodes, all the way to honoring a few more convention attendance requests. They also outline not only your helping us reach where we need to be, but at what point we can redirect our annual Pledge Drive to simply be about charity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we are unable to make some of our milestones will the podcast end? The short answer is not if we can help it. A longer answer is, depending on how the annual pledge drive goes; we may need to scale back to just the main podcast. It takes a lot of time, effort, and money to produce The Game of Crowd Funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to check out our Patreon page. If you like what we produce, and it is within your means to support us; we hope you decide to become a Patron of All Us Geeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to see the current breakdown of our financials, we share them on the All Us Geeks website here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.allusgeeks.com/2015/02/the-2015-financials-patreon-and-the-march-pledge-drive/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://www.allusgeeks.com/2015/02/the-2015-financials-patreon-and-the-march-pledge-drive/\u003c/a\u003e"
