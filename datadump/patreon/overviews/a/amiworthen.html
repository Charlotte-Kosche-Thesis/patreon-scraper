    "summary": "As a writer, I believe an inclusive, honest narrative is an essential tool as we move towards justice and liberation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write for people who believe we can transform society. Much of my work is specifically for white people who are seeking to address white supremacy. Most of my current readers live in Asheville, NC and are looking for opportunities to bridge the social segregation we live within in order to build authentic relationships across cultures. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA frequent topic of my writing is systemic oppression - how it is manifested and how we might dismantle it. I also highlight initiatives led by people of color. With a local focus, my blog posts and events calendar highlight culturally diverse opportunities to engage in community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am dedicated to contributing to a new paradigm, motivated by a vision of a collective narrative that is truly collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT I WAS DOING BEFORE PATREON: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince launching my writing career in June 2013, I have published over 140 blog posts and produced 30 articles (and counting). My social reach is currently almost 2,000 people. My work has received accolades for showcasing overlooked stories and people who might otherwise have gone unrecognized. My readers frequently tell me that my writing has shifted their perspectives and behaviors, helping them learn how to do less harm and more good in our community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHERE I\u2019M GOING NEXT (WITH YOUR HELP):\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoving forward, my intention is to write more in depth pieces about the dynamics of oppression and the bold alternatives available on the path towards liberation. Additionally, there are inspiring leaders and projects I want write about, controversial opinion pieces to dive into, and stories from community elders to capture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patreon sponsor, you can choose from a range of incentives, including access to a phone call or one-on-one meeting with me, to discuss any topic you would like to process. There is also an opportunity to attend an annual Patreon party. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour financial support will allow me to invest time into research, interviews, writing, and publishing transformative content on a consistent basis. It also will go towards time spent maintaining a community events calendar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBIO:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to writing, my professional work includes supporting the successful launch of social enterprises, assisting with marketing and systems creation. Strategically using my skills in communications, I have individually and collaboratively worked to raise awareness about social issues. With a heart for the power of community connectivity, I help produce transformative events of all sizes.
