Crowdfunding has become such a key factor in my life as an artist over the years that it only makes sense that I land here, on Patreon. This is a place where people can show their support and help sustain the creative process by becoming an official patron of my art. This helps me in many ways to move forward and make time to create more music to share with my followers, and in the process, stay connected with my followers and offer different perks to show my appreciation.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal: write and record a new collection of songs for my next album (2019)! The style will be heavier than my previous solo albums... so things could get interesting! Along the way, I\u0027d like to share my process with you, chat, serenade you with some acoustic cover songs, ... and offer a few surprises here and there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a peek at my tiers rewards\u00a0(on the right), as there all kinds of things happening in this Underground of mine...
