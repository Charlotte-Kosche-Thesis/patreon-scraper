The catch here is that I need to redraw the first 3 chapters to fit printing specifications, and it\u0027ll be difficult because I have to draw like it\u0027s 2009 so nothing looks totally out of place. Scary and amazing!!",

     "description": "I\u0027ve been wanting to do this for a while! I am often approached by people at conventions (mostly girls) who want to know more about how to make and publish their very own comics. I LOVE the idea of helping them get started, so at $40 a month, I will begin production on a short how-to book for convention AND online sale! This book will be under $10 to make it more accessible to the kids who want to read it, and there will be a limited number of free copies when I do conventions. ($10+ patrons will get a free .PDF when it\u0027s done!)",
