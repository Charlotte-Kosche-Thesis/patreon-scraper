     "about": "Alfred Hitchcock is the Shakespeare of the 20th century. No wonder his films have been studied, his life dissected and his style imitated more than any other filmmaker. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started geeking out on Alfred Hitchcock at age twelve, when I caught a documentary about his filmmaking techniques on our local Public Broadcasting Station in Portland, Oregon.  I was so fascinated by what I saw, that I ran out and bought his authorized biography. And that was BEFORE I\u2019d seen any of his films. At some point, Rebecca (1940) came on TV and that was my first contact with one his actual films. I was hooked. And spooked. Later, I fell among filmmakers and scholars who did absolutely nothing to curb my obsession. Those experiences led to an online writing project that scholars have called \"The best Hitchcock blog on the Internet.\" Speaking appearances include two gigs at The 39 Steps on Broadway.
