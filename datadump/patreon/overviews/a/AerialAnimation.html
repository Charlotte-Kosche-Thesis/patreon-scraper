    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi, I\u2019m Abigail Baird, the creator of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aerialanimation.com/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAerial Animation\u003c/a\u003e.\nPerforming aerial acrobatics in front of projected animation, I create the\nillusion that I live inside an animated world. Aerial Animation tells dreamlike\nstories that feel like opening your favorite book and watching as the adventure\ncomes to life before your eyes. The audience joins my adventure and together we\nescape a bear, swim faster than a sharp-toothed shark and ride a pegasus\nthrough clouds before falling asleep on the chin of the moon.\u00a0Aerial Animation is a Story Like No Other Story, it\u2019s Everyone\u2019s Story. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are endless ways to expand and I have ideas! My first\ngoal is to create a 20-minute show. To do this I need to give Aerial Animation\nall of my attention. I want to create an animated circus. I want to pull\nrabbits out of a hat and get shot out of a cannon. Don\u2019t you want to see me get\nshot of a cannon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHere\u2019s the catch. Animation is expensive. Like \u201cbuy a boat\u201d or\n\u201cput a down payment on a house\u201d kind of expensive. So I\u2019m looking to you for\nsupport. Your monthly donation, whether large or small, will help fuel my big\nideas. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAerial Animation competed through the Semifinals of Season 9 on\n\u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d. My live performances received standing ovations and had\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/w-VA0w_eX4Y?t=4m2s\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eHoward Stern\u003c/a\u003e on his feet exclaiming, \u201cI love your mind... I love it!\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe exposure provided me with the courage to promote my company\nand we combined each of our 2-minute performances to create one cohesive act.\nOver the last year we have traveled to Asia, Africa, the United Kingdom and\nperformed all over the United States. All of that world travel for one 6-minute\nact\u2026 imagine where we could go with a 20-minute show! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a fighter with a will to succeed. If it means working\nharder, I get up earlier. But I can\u2019t do it alone. As the sole proprietor and\nlead performer of Aerial Animation, I need to hire animators, acrobats and\nmusicians to create each performance. These talented people have skills that\nare valuable. This means I need to pay them for their work. I also need to eat\nbecause let\u0027s face it food is an important part of creating good art. It feeds\nthe brain. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your support I can make Aerial Animation my full-time job. All of your support is\nappreciated and every little bit helps. Check out our contribution options on\nthe right to see the personal ways we will recognize your donation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy drive to create something the world had never seen before\nled me to the greatest achievement of my career. But the true accomplishment of\nAerial Animation is the reward of inspiring others. This company speaks to the\nheart of who I am and it is the gift that keeps on giving. With ingenuity and\ndexterity I can expand my horizons, accomplish even more and bring new imagery\nto my story. Help me make the impossible achievable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Mime,\ncostume design and gymnastics provided a foundation that sparked her career and\ncircus provided an outlet for her diverse skill-set. She has a self-designed BA\nin Tech Theatre and Puppetry and is thrilled to actually be using this\neducation. Abigail taught and trained at NECCA in Vermont and studied at\nCircomedia in England before joining Wise Fool New Mexico as a touring performer\nand teacher in 2007. Wanting to develop her skill set in hand to hand, she\nmoved to Oakland, CA in 2010. Now Abigail is giving a new face to circus with\nher vaudevillian production company Aerial Animation. Performing through the\nSemi-final\u2019s on Season 9 of \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d, she received\nmultiple standing ovations. Continuing to perform Aerial Animation all over the world brings her indubitable joy.\u003cbr\u003e",
