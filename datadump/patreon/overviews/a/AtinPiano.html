    "summary": "Hi\npiano fans! You\u0027re probably here because you\u2019re following my piano channel on\nYouTube. I started my channel about six years ago as a way to share the soundtracks I love with the world. This project has since become an integral part of me and I am incredibly fortunate and thankful to have such a big number of people caring about my music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you asking for donations?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating these videos takes a lot of time and the equipment I use to create the high-quality video and audio isn\u0027t cheap. I run this channel because I love doing it, but I can only dedicate so much of my free time to it because I have to make a living as well. Many of you have asked me to upload more frequently and more complex pieces. With your help I will be able to spend more time on creating these videos and eventually jack up the production value and deliver some more sophisticated audio quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut don\u0027t you already make money from YouTube ads?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI do! However, because my channel only features covers of existing songs, more than 50% of all that revenue goes directly to the copyright holder of the original songs after Youtube subtracts their own share (more than half) and my network dealing with all the licensing takes another hefty amount. You can probably imagine: There isn\u0027t much left in the end. This isn\u0027t me being bad at negotiating, this is just the way YouTube works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so what is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is essentially a miniature Kickstarter that lets you pledge a small amount of your choosing for each video I produce. Right now I usually upload one video per month and you can cancel/change your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon supporters will receive the MIDI file of all my performances a week earlier as well as a copy of my\npersonal music sheets including detailed\nfingerings for all difficult sections, annotations regarding specific\ntechniques used and so on. For additional rewards like high quality FLAC audio files please check out the rewards\nsection below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe basic sheet music and mp3 downloads I\nprovide for all my songs will always remain free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Almost gave up after a couple of years because I was bored of the song choices by my teacher, but then discovered the Final Fantasy piano collections and video game soundtracks in general. They have kept me going ever since. Playing these iconic melodies lets me relive the emotional journeys I\u0027ve experienced playing those games and seeing my fans enjoying my performances is incredibly rewarding.",
