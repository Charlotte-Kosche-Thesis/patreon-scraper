My love and feel for music are carried out with intentions of communicating my emotions to people. I would hope that my music can change someone because it has changed me so much, positively ,and brought me to a healthier state of mind.Battling the hate of the scene as the onlookers demand to be mainstream, go to college, work a boring job, you know what i mean? I know that with the support and honesty from my patrons my music would allow me to give my full expression of my emotion."
