I hope to use this site to get some backing to publish a book of poetry in the 4th quarter of 2017 as well as get some money flowing for my keg fund for my birthday. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a weirdo and each year for my birthday I do a Keg Fund for the party with the idea being: Have you ever been invited to a party and thought what should I bring, but what\u0027s in it for me? \u00a0Well let me meet you in the middle by having you donate money to pay for the food and beer so that we can all party together which is all I really want for my birthday!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the art portion of this website(content is king!) I\u0027m just going to tell you to type Altoecko poetry into Google for the time being but real work will trickle in here, I promise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my page and supporting my art or supporting my fun. Regardless thanks for your time and I hope to have video of me reciting poems by the end of the month!"
