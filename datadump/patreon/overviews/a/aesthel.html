    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/LMz7adC.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! My name is Aesthel and I am an alternative model and cosplayer from Maine and I run the magical inspired shop RunicTreasure on Etsy. I also work with The Shoggoth Assembly doing special effects for local independent films and making props, tabling at tons of conventions across the New England Area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Jb0bOiS.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of my work, I am a full time college student in my second year studying New Media and Communications. I hope to one day be working more in the film and media industry while also being able to support myself more with my shop and modeling work. I have chronic health issues that make some things that would usually be considered \u0026#8220;normal\u0026#8221; really hard for me to do. I would say the biggest of my health problems would be my Narcolepsy and physical body limitations. These are a huge part of the reason I hope to be successful in things like my artwork and modeling, since they are both things that I really enjoy doing and I can do without causing stress or harm to myself. Some of my hobbies include cooking, working on cosplay, sketching, and gaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NnYpZfI.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy shop Runic Treasure is heavily inspired by all things magical and witchy. It has been in business since Spring 2014 and the main thing I make is tarot decks. My shop has had a total of three decks that are all my own original designs; The Leonardo Da Vinci Tarot, The David Bowie Tarot, and The Vintage Horror Tarot. The two most recent ones (the Bowie Tarot and Horror Tarot) were both originally extremely successful Kickstarter projects. I used the crowdsourcing platform of Kickstarter to raise the funds required to get the first prints of each deck made. Aside from my tarot decks, I also have a small but growing line of witch inspired bath products. As of right now the line is all hand made soap bars, some of which are original sculpts and molds created by me. My shop frequently travels, sharing tables with the Shoggoth Assembly at conventions and having it\u0026#8217;s own tables art art walks and other local events. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/lo6BRjn.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got my start modeling because I originally did a lot of cosplay photoshoots and I always had such a fun time with those. The first shoot I ever did as just myself instead of wearing a costume was my senior photos, and that unveiled a whole new world to me. I did my first official photoshoot in September of 2014 and since then have worked with over 20 different photographers and done over 45 different photoshoots. It seems strange looking back at my first ever shoot, since I have grown and changed so much since then. More recently, my modeling career has brought me two different sponsorships from companies. I have also just started to scratch the surface of having my work submitted to magazines and other publications, which is something I am really looking forward to expanding on in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/66AZJs5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will be able to help me be able to expand what I do in many different areas. As far as modeling goes, any money I get from Patreon can help me afford any costs that go into producing my photoshoots and start doing more elaborate and in depth shoots than I do now. For my shop, Patreon will help me get the chance to work on some new projects and work on adding new creations to my collections. It will help me be able to get the extra practice I need to get in working with new materials so I will be sure I am providing the absolute best product I can make to my customers. Outside of the work I do, Patreon will help me have more security with my income and help me be less stressed, which in turn will help me have more time to work on new creations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/iGKtIX5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEveryone who helps fund my Patreon will have full access to my Patreon exclusive feed. This will include early access to any of my finished work but also much more that can only be found here! I will be making various videos that will only be able to be viewed through Patreon including streams, make up application videos, tutorials, and reviews. There will also lots of behind the scenes and progress posts where I will show you how I do things for my shop, photoshoots, cosplay, and much more. With higher pledges more rewards are available, please check out the section on the right to see what other options there are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
