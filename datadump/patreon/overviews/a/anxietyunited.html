Being a sufferer of anxiety myself for over a decade, I\u0027ve long been aware of the difficulties in finding support. I created Anxiety United to give sufferers a place to engage with others who could relate and offer advice and guidance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the time since Anxiety United has been established, the project has grown to something which far exceeded my initial expectations. The impact Anxiety United has had via social media has been my biggest surprise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over 5 years now, I\u0027ve been documenting my ups and downs with anxiety on youtube and have recently been putting a lot of time in to creating videos which help explain certain conditions and symptoms of this debilitating condition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for my Patreon campaign is to allow me to put more of my time in to creating these resources, more videos and more podcast episodes. I\u0027d like to be able to dedicate my time to finding answers and sharing them. Learning from professionals, learning from experience and offering my findings to all those who suffer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also recently completed a Diploma in Mindfulness of which I passed with a distinction, which I intend to use to create more media for sufferers to use and help them overcome anxiety and rebuild their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnxiety has already taken up a decade of my life and I\u0027d be happy to give my all to learn, share and help other sufferers break down these anxiety barriers."
