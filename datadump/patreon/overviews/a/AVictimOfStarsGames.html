I\u0027m a queer lady writer who once wrote \u003cem\u003eabout\u003c/em\u003e games, and now I want to write games instead! I originally formed A Victim of Stars Games 3 years ago to start working on Visual Novels with some friends, but we\u0027ve never been able to keep up momentum due to the lack of funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help and support, we have a plan to move forward and complete our first visual novel, a short girls love OELVN temporarily titled \"In Winter\", which you\u0027ll learn more about below. Your patronage will help us by paying for the costs of asset production, and in doing so will give us the freedom to create what we need to finish the game without having to worry as much about the realities of the money we\u0027re not earning otherwise. I\u0027m super excited to work with our new artist (who is shy and doesn\u0027t want to introduce herself yet), and I am grateful for anyone who will help us bring everything to life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn Winter:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"At least I can see her eyes now.

Except for one small secret - Shiori has been in love with Sayara since they were young, even if she only came to fully understand her feelings in the years leading up to graduation. The two have settled in to unremarkable lives in the town they grew up in, hanging on to their creative talents as they feel their best years eroding to the monotony of adult life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShortly after Sayara tries her hand at the dating world, a friend of Shiori\u0027s tries to convince her to study abroad with her at the illustrious Suijoki Academy. She finds herself facing difficult questions. Should she risk telling Sayara her feelings, knowing that she might hate her or feel uncomfortable? What would their life be like if she decided to stay? Could she live with herself if she chose to leave home without telling the truth?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I could be offered a book deal, or given a chance to have some of my work featured at a live event, and none of it would matter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e  Every day, the only thing I wanted to see was your name on my screen.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/u6Bm57l.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e(Shiori WIP/Temp art - style not final!)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShiori Haino\u003c/strong\u003e is normally a quiet, reserved girl who has an infectiously bubbly energy around her best friend. She buried herself in books at a young age and grew up wanting to be a writer, always seen with a notebook and pen in hand in school. Shiori struggles with anxieties and depression, often sinking into dark places when stressed out, but also has to keep herself from gushing too openly when she\u0027s with the girl she loves. She\u0027s dreamed of a future together with Sayara for so long, but is unable to get past her fears of rejection and the pain of possibly losing her best friend. If she turns to the next page, will it be the start of a new chapter? Or will it be the end of their story?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Art, to me, is about expressing ideas in a way that comes naturally to you. A one-way conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy would I care about what someone sees in me or my works?\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/ENKhQO7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e(Sayara WIP/Temp art - style not final!)\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSayara Nagamiya\u003c/strong\u003e has had difficulties with her social life as long as she can remember, preferring to retreat to her room to paint over spending an afternoon in a noisy public place. She would, however, follow her best friend Shiori on long walks to the lighthouse at the edge of town, or call her to talk about the latest rhythm game news until midnight. Sayara always seems stressed out to others, and some of her other friends often poke fun at her agitation. Luckily, Shiori is always there to provide a comfortable place for her to go when she finds herself overloaded. Her paintings are filled with emotive strokes and vivid hues, but what is it that she\u0027s trying to say? Can she understand the bigger picture before the color in her life completely fades away?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUne Historie de Bleu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"In Winter\" started life as a way for me to work out some feelings relating to my sexuality and the difficulties I face in expressing myself to other women. As I dove into a world of girls love doujins and works, I was inspired by the imagery and particulars of the page layouts to tell effective stories within the limitations of their mediums. This gave me a few ideas on how I could use visual cues to give the game its own, personal touch. As the weather cooled down, I daydreamed of scenes between Shiori and Sayara to the chilly ambient atmospherics of Federico Durand and the minimal soundscapes of the Hitokomakura project. A year and a half later, I hope to finally make this deeply personal story something everyone can experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I have been writing my whole life, I\u0027ve never done a full game before and I am pretty eager to finally publish one! I\u0027ve taught myself enough python to get our engine, \u003ca href=\"https://www.renpy.org/\"\u003eRen\u0027py\u003c/a\u003e, to do what I want it to. The script itself is about 50% complete, with the remaining scenes heavily outlined in advance. Unfortunately, I am not an artist. Fortunately, I found a friend who draws cute girls! Perfect!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, okay... not \u003cem\u003equite\u003c/em\u003e perfect. Reality hit in a big way, and your support will allow me to pay them a decent commission so we can focus on making the game rather than staring at our empty bank accounts. Due to the sudden nature of things, we do not have any finalized work to show yet, but here are a few samples of some of their completed works, to get an idea of what level of quality we\u0027re aiming for. \u003cem\u003eJust remember - the following two artworks are not related to \"In Winter\" in any way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/SbbtPqI.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/GXBYZSm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eAs a patron to us, you can gain access to exclusive update posts. Higher tiers will allow you to get your name in the credits, as well as more in-depth looks at development and hands on with any internal demos we produce! If we manage to maintain our goal of $200 a month, we should be asset-complete by the end of the year and ready to launch in early 2019. No matter the size of your contribution, it is a huge help to us! Thank you so much for your interest in our little gay game!\u003cbr\u003e"
