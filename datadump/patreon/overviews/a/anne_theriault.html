It\u0027s not exactly lucrative at the best of times, and when most of your focus is on feminist analysis the pay is even crummier. I\u0027m not sure why I just implied that feminist analysis is the opposite of the best of times, because effing up the patriarchy is literally the funnest ever, but, well, here we are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of the stuff I create is free for your perusal, and that\u0027s not going to change. I\u0027m not going to set up a pay-wall on my blog or start an elaborate matriarchal Ponzi scheme. Pretty much everything I write will be yours to enjoy for the low, low price of nothing. But if you like what you read and you want to donate something, that would be rad. Even $1 a month would be awesome. Like, that would buy me at \u003cem\u003eleast \u003c/em\u003etwo lattes a year, maybe three if I get them real small.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe past year has been a struggle for my family financially. We had bedbugs for most of 2014 (hey, remember when you were a kid and your mom would say \"good night, sleep tight, don\u0027t let the bedbugs bite\" and you would both laugh and laugh because bedbugs don\u0027t exist anymore and OH THE DELICIOUS IRONY THOSE MEMORIES NOW CONTAIN FOR ME), which basically ate up our savings. I have, like, three jobs and my husband works full time but shit is expensive, you know?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway. If you like what I have to say and you want to support me, that\u0027s super rad. If you can\u0027t afford to donate anything or you\u0027re just not into it, that\u0027s rad too. I love you no matter what. Thank you for your support whatever form that support takes - sharing my stuff, reading, commenting, what have you. You guys are the reason for the season, and the season is the eternal springtime of my hopeful heart. Or something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnne"
