I want to use patreon as a new platform\nto release things on, catered to people who care enough about my work\nto support me financially. this will mean lots of demos and cool alt\nversions and basically everything I ever make. if that sounds cool or\ninteresting at all, feel free to give a small donation a month, and\nthank you so much for supporting my art and buying my merch and\ncoming to our shows~\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nhelp\nme make art forever\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-jackson\u003cbr\u003e"
