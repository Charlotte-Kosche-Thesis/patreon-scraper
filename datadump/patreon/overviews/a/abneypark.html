Just like radio shows of old, this would come out once a month (or more, if we make our Patreon goals). It would be REALLY cool to have steampunk celebrities form outside Abney Park play different characters in the drama! \u00a0We\u0027ve already talked to Professor Elemental (who make a GREAT Doctor Calgori) and John Sprocket from The Cog Is Dead (who could do just about anything, since he\u0027s a big time pro voice actor) and both said they\u0027d be interested!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.abneypark.com/2015site/retrograde3.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eIf you haven\u2019t read it, this is a swashbuckling, time traveling, monster fighting, rebel-against-the-establishment series with airships, and pirates and mechanical mermaids, automatons and neobedoiuns, and all kinds of amazing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.abneypark.com/patreon/1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.abneypark.com/patreon/games.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.abneypark.com/patreon/escape-the-cage-demo.jpg\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ve been developing games for years, based around the Abney Park world.

And it wasn\u0027t even that nice of a box!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, we will give you these games to download when you subscribe to our Patreon Fan Club!

When Abney Park started, it was all about selling records and tapes. Then it was about selling CD\u0027s, and our biggest threat was people copying the CD\u0027s instead of buying them. Then it was about selling MP3\u0027s, and our biggest threat was people pirating them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, iTunes came along and made it way easier to by music then steal it, our income soared to the highest its ever been, and so I quit my day job. That was around about 2005.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround 2008, corporations stepped in, and said, \"This pirating music idea is great! How can we make money off of distributing artist\u0027s music without paying them much?\" And they invented the streaming sites like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, Youtube, etc. Over the last few years of this, Abney Park\u0027s audience has continued to grow, our music is listened to by more people then ever, but thanks to streaming sites like Spotify we are making a third of what we used to. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd the amount we now make is\u00a0not enough to pay the bills. Just ask my mortgage company!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.abneypark.com/patreon/income.jpg\"\u003e\"BUT SPOTIFY IS AWESOME FOR FANS!\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeah, I know it is. I wish it wasn\u0027t, because its killing us, but it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, thanks to Patreon, and you, we\u0027ve found a way to balance the scales! \u00a0If you subscribe to us, our income will go back to what it was, and we can keep making you stuff. And in return, we\u0027ll give you TONS of free music, all the time. And if you use Spotify, you have our blessing to stream our music as much as you want.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you join the Abney Park Patreon Fan Club, you can make sure Abney Park gets paid fairly for our art, and have our blessing to stream our music on as many sites as you want!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider subscribing to our Patreon page, so you can get in on all the cool stuff we\u0027ll be giving out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
