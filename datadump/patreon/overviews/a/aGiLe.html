    "summary": "Hi guys, my name is aGiLe and if you haven\u0027t watched me on twitch prior to visiting this page I\u0027ve been streaming and creating content for the Zerg players within the Starcraft 2 community for 5 years now. I\u0027ve created this Patreon for those that are a bit more serious about their improvement in Starcraft 2 and would like to set up a monthly coaching routine with me, where I\u0027ll teach you to play and understand Starcraft 2 the way I play and see the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCoaching on my stream I generally market at 30$ per hour for non subs and 25$ per hour for subscribers, for those who are willing to pick up more hours and take this sort of routine coaching more seriously I\u0027m willing to come down on those prices a bit. Below are the packages I\u0027m offering to those who would like to see faster improvement in their own play, and while it\u0027s my responsibility to make sure you take away something from each coaching sessions \u003cstrong\u003eit is your responsibility to find a practice partner for the days / hours you wish me to coach you\u003c/strong\u003e. (Preferably someone who is an entire league higher than your current skill level. (I.E. You\u0027re diamond 3 -\u0026gt; Find Masters 3)"
