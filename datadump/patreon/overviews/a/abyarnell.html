    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, my name is Alex, and I\u0027ve been trying to write a novel for six years. It\u0027s finally time for me to admit that I need help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Apologies in advance for the wall of text. If you don\u0027t want to read it all, I\u0027ve included a \u003cstrong\u003etl;dr \u003c/strong\u003esummary at the end.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/10641151_10153542110772573_2596066418627930960_n.jpg?oh=8f4428994769cad6923c89a4860e48c5\u0026amp;oe=5B24B07B\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eProbably the only day in my life I\u0027ve looked semi-cool. Kudos to my fab boyfriend for capturing this moment.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I sat down for my second attempt at NaNoWriMo (National Novel Writing Month). At the time, life was... rough. I had just dropped my English literature degree due to my spiraling mental health, and was struggling to find joy in the things I normally loved, like reading and writing.\u00a0 Besides, I\u0027d already failed at NaNoWriMo the previous year. Who was to say this attempt would be any different?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYet I needed a distraction from real life, so I came up with a concept that intrigued me and poured my heart and soul into it. I wrote 40,000 words of a first draft that November - not quite the 50k target for most NaNoWriMo participants, but it was nonetheless a huge accomplishment for me. Sure, it was messy and poorly-constructed, but I\u0027d effectively written a short essay every day, and - even more importantly - I had the beginnings of a story and characters I actually \u003cem\u003eloved.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been so long that I honestly can\u0027t remember exactly where the idea for my story came from. All I know is I wanted to create something that pulled little bits from the fantasy novels and tv shows that I loved, mashed them all together, and added new features that I would personally want to see as a reader.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be real. I\u0027ve loved fantasy since I was a little girl, but the genre is deeply flawed and could use some polishing to keep up with the times. Issues like diversity, compassion, and being socially conscious have become more and more important to me over the years, and my lifelong dream to become a published author has metamorphosed into one to become a published author of a novel that helps the genre take a step in the right direction (even if that step is infinitesimally small). I want to write the kind of novel that I wish I had read twenty years ago, when my views of the world were still developing; the kind that might help someone empathize with people they can\u0027t relate to; and the kind for those people who don\u0027t see themselves represented like they should (not just in fantasy, but in the media as a whole). I want to write a novel that represents hope and change in a time where people all over the world feel scared and defeated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe my goals are too high. Obviously I\u0027m just one person, and there\u0027s only so much I can do to influence the fantasy world (and the real world, for that matter). I don\u0027t have all the answers. I\u0027m a tiny drop of water in a fathomless ocean, and I make mistakes. I\u0027m bound to make more. I\u0027m only human, after all. Nor am I proclaiming to be the first person to set out with the aim of writing diverse fiction. There are lots of brilliant authors out there doing just that, right this second as I type these words. They are incredible, and you absolutely should read their work. \u003cem\u003eGo.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eDo it now.\u003c/em\u003e Support them to show the market that there is a demand for their stuff. They\u0027re probably better than I will ever be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I can promise is that I will try my hardest to write something that I\u0027m proud of. If the finished product affects even one person positively, then I\u0027ll be happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been six years since I wrote that first draft. The basic story is still latched onto my brain, refusing to let go, but I have little to show for the soul-crushing passage of time other than pages and pages of brainstorming. I\u0027ve started and restarted a second draft multiple times. Much has changed about the original plot and characters. I tell myself I\u0027ve been polishing it - making it better - but in truth I\u0027m just holding myself back by constantly second-guessing myself. I\u0027m also lacking confidence and motivation. I\u0027m terrified people won\u0027t like it. At this rate, I\u0027ll be lucky to publish before I retire (and there\u0027s nothing wrong with that, for some people - but it so happens that I have a lot of other stories I want to write too, and sadly immortality isn\u0027t a thing yet).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t mean to turn this into a pity party, but I have to be honest. Another reason I\u0027ve been stuck for so long is my health. The issues which cropped up during my university days and played a huge role in my dropping-out are still very much a part of my life. Don\u0027t worry; I\u0027m okay. I\u0027m seeing medical professionals regularly and have a boyfriend to support me. However, as anyone else with a chronic illness will understand, I have only so much energy to spend on a daily basis, so I have to spend it wisely. I\u0027m like a Sim with its \u0027needs\u0027 bars constantly in the yellow - if I\u0027m lucky and manage to spend a productive few hours working, that\u0027s it - I\u0027m wiped the rest of the day. I envy those people who can come home after a long day of work and spend their evenings or weekends writing. That\u0027s just not something I can do - that\u0027s my \u0027recharge\u0027 time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurthermore, as of 2016, I\u0027m lucky enough to be a freelancer and choose my own hours. The price of this, of course, is that if I don\u0027t work, I don\u0027t get paid. Therefore, any time I spend writing is precious time I could be spending earning income. Considering I\u0027m not able to work \u0027normal\u0027 hours, I just can\u0027t afford to lose that money. In other words, I can\u0027t afford to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. Your monthly pledge will buy me writing time, and your support will give me the kick in the butt I need to keep to a schedule (or the closest to one I can manage). In return you\u0027ll get regular updates on my progress, snippets of my novel, writing advice, and plenty of other incentives (depending on how much you pledge - see the side bar to the right for more info). At some point I will need beta readers too, and you\u0027ll be the first people I come to, which means you\u0027ll have the chance to read the finished draft and give your feedback on it. When I get published (and I \u003cem\u003ewill \u003c/em\u003eget published one way or another), you\u0027ll not only have my eternal thanks, but the satisfaction of knowing that you helped make my book possible.\u00a0For more information on how rewards and pledges work, look for my post titled \"Hello current \u0026amp; future patrons\", found under the \"FAQ\" tag. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you believe in my project and want to see it become reality, please consider becoming my patron. I\u0027m not ashamed to admit I need all the help I can get. If you have any questions, let me know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003etl;dr \u003c/strong\u003eGot a craving for diverse fantasy or just want to support an underdog author-to-be who\u0027s somewhat lacking in the cash department?
