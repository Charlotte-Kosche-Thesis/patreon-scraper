    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI write stories of fantasy and science fiction, and I have for a long time. I have more than thirty short stories published, two collections from Small Beer Press, and a novel that appeared from Ballantine. But as a trans woman, my writing has radically changed in subject matter the last couple of years and now I\u0027m dedicated to writing stories that center trans women. Trans women are often not given agency in fiction--they are usually given the role of a trope rather than a complex character and with other trans creators I hope to keep changing that, and write things where trans people can see their authentic selves reflected in the prose (and being unafraid to move away from realistic forms of fiction and testimony, which often trans woman have been consigned to.).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent things I\u0027ve been working on include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA YA novel entitled \u003cem\u003eGlitchblood\u003c/em\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e about a young trans women who trains dragons for a fantasy television show. It\u0027s currently seeking a publisher via my awesome agent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also am \u003cstrong\u003eworking on a new YA novel\u003c/strong\u003e, tentatively called \u003cem\u003eMidnight Jubilee,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that\u0027s based on the same world in a story that I had published in \u003cem\u003eOne Teen Story \u003c/em\u003ein 2017. This is a novel has a large cast of young people with various identities in a world where debt gets injected inside of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make games using Twine. \u003cstrong\u003eMy most recent release is called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://adeniro.itch.io/a-bathroom-myth\"\u003eA Bathroom Myth\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, a magic realist game about trans women using bathrooms in a magical city, which is a pay what you can fundraiser for the Transgender Law Center.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait, there\u0027s more! As in short stories! Along with various other stories of fabulism,\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m writing a series of linked short stories\u003c/strong\u003e from the 2nd person perspective of a forty-something trans woman (also weird magic realism, go figure) called \u003cem\u003eOKPsyche\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0tentatively.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://persistentvisionsmag.com/fiction/etruscan-sugar-anya-johanna-deniro\"\u003eThe first story of that series was published\u003c/a\u003e in late 2016 in \u003cem\u003ePersistent Visions.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, along with poems and other miscellany, \u003cstrong\u003eI have also been doing more games reviewing\u003c/strong\u003e, with a particular focus on earlyish, weird games from the Interactive Fiction community. This is a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://sub-q.com/the-works-of-rybread-celsius-a-critical-reassessment/\"\u003erecent piece I did looking back at the games of Rybread Celsius\u003c/a\u003e that I\u0027m very happy with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, yeah, I have a lot on my plate and more than anything I just want to \u003cstrong\u003ekeep going.\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAny donation to my monthly Patreon, tiny or slightly more than tiny, will be a huge help as I balance my writing with a full time day job and co-parenting twin 6 year olds. It will help me pay for server space for my various writing projects, basic needs like groceries and medicine, and for emergencies that tend to crop up. Also: if I reach certain goals I hope to reduce the amount of editing freelancing I do to supplement my income, which would give me more time to write.* So these gifts are really like bestowing tiny bits of time onto me. That\u0027s amazing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*If you are interested in fiction consulting or a sensitivity reading, inquire within! My rates are pretty reasonable.\u003c/div\u003e"
