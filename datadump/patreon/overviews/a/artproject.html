Print-on-demand merchandise is in the works, but we\u0027d love to be able to invest in printing ahead of time - shirts, buttons, stickers, etc - so that we can bring the merchandise to shows. This isn\u0027t even including the fact that we want to upgrade our gear, allowing us to play out more often and with higher quality sound, as well as giving us the opportunity to experiment and grow as musicians.
