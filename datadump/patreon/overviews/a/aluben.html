So it was only\nnatural that I studied to become a lawyer, right? Errr\u2026 Kinda. I still kept\nwriting as a major hobby and, for the last three years or so, I\u00b4ve been working\nnon stop on \u201cThe Last Days of Aluben\u201d, my first novel which I expect to launch in\nlate 2017.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eBut wait just a second... \"Aluben\" isn\u00b4t just about one book, nope! I spent a lot of time, money and love (especially love!) bringing Aluben to life not only through words, but also complete profiles and tons of art showing the main and supporting characters. Here it is what I expect to expand on Aluben in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/jn8dov/Nicole800.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eThe Novel\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e. This is where it all started. Aluben is the name of a\npost-apocalyptic fantasy world that takes place in the afterlife. Yeah, yeah,\nsounds complicated, but in reality it isn\u00b4t, until you learn that Aluben is\nalso the name of the goddess of said world and she has a conscience of its own\nthat interferes with the universe. Wait, it does sound complicated hmmm...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. Okay, let\u00b4s try another introduction. As you might suspect from the book title, Aluben is dying and her disease is way more complicated than what seems to be. The goddess is powered by a mystical energy that should only be used by her to maintain balance in the world (and no, it\u00b4s not the Force). Of course that something baaad happened. In this case, angels and demons - Aluben\u00b4s first creations - started using the energy for their own goals, which only contributed to weaken the poor goddess more and more. Now she is just a shade of her former self. This has severe implications, as the world reacts to her state and also dies with each passing day. Entire oceans are turning into deserts and curses fall upon cities. Even anomalies defying the laws of physics are starting to appear, changing how gravity works or making the weather unpredictable, when a sunny day can turn into a lightning storm and then a snow shower in a matter of minutes. If Aluben indeed dies, the entire world disappears in a wave of fire and the universe comes to an end - Aluben, Earth, the Milk Way... goodbye everything! So what can be done to save Aluben? Nothing. The goddess wants to die as a form to punish angels and demons, and she has her loyal warrior Nicole by her side to make sure that she will cease to exist. It\u00b4s up to Nicole to condemn an entire world to a death sentence and kill Aluben, creating a whole new universe in its place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. Books are very time consuming and can be very expensive even before hitting the shelves. I want to give my novel the best treatment possible and I\u00b4ve already spent around $1500USD with revisions (hey, portuguese grammar is pretty hard). Honestly, it was a well spent money, since the revisions also make you read the whole book again and again and it gives you fresh new ideas! Every patreon money will help with this too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. My main focus will be to translate the book to english with the help of a professional. It needs to be someone that dominates both the brazilian portuguese and the english languages, which is not easy at all to find. However, I did come across some names on Upwork and it seems that the price for a full translation is around $3000-$4000USD. Help! :( The main focus of the Patreon would be to get money to make the translation possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/cjzjTv/Garreth800.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Characters\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e. The world of Aluben is mostly populated by humans, angels and demons... and also weird bloodthirsty beasts that make a cameo from time to time. Angels and demons are not that different from one another, since both races were driven crazy trying to find a way to save Aluben so they don\u00b4t get purged. Humans also suffered a lot... and not only humans that live in Aluben! Even people in good old Earth got very unlucky when they got attacked and murdered by the spiritual beings that decided to invade our home. Once they killed someone here, the human body and spirit would appear in Aluben to live there... but the angels and demons had another idea in mind, consuming their souls and turning it into energy to extend the goddess\u00b4 life just a little longer.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e. There are three mains characters in Aluben and two supporting characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNicole\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e is one of the main characters. Once a priestess, she is now the Messenger - the person that listens to the goddess and exists to follow Aluben\u00b4s desires. It is up to Nicole to keep the spirit of Aluben alive inside her body and find a way to destroy it. Let\u00b4s say that a lot of people don\u00b4t like Nicole that much... can\u00b4t blame them, after all if the Messenger is successful in her journey everyone else dies and a new world with new laws is born.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eElisa\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e was born in Bucharest, Romania and she is brought to Aluben under unfortunate circumstances. Elisa has the power of four angels living inside her body, each of them granting the woman a special power connected to the elements. Only one angel can be \"active\" at any given time, which means that she can only control only one element at once! Think about her like an underpowered avatar Korra. Oh, her hair changes color depending on the angel that is helping her. Neat!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eGarreth\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is Elisa\u00b4s brother and he comes to Aluben as a special guest invited by Nicole. He is one of the few people that died on Earth and managed to awake in Aluben without being killed by the spiritual beings. Of course that there is a very special reason for the Messenger to have saved him, as Garreth will be a key element if they all want to kill Aluben and have guaranteed lives in the next universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eEllayne\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is a fairy that serves as the link between Elisa and the angels inside the woman\u00b4s body. Without Ellayne, Elisa can\u00b4t cast spells. Oh, Ellayne is also who put the angels inside Elisa in the first place, pissing her off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEllioth\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e is... a boy I think? In theory, Ellioth doesn\u00b4t even exist. He is a physical manifestation created by Nicole of a 14yo kid that helps Garreth when he wakes up in Aluben. Ellioth does have a conscience and he can be summoned at will by his master. Disadvantages for being a creation: Can suddenly disappear if Nicole wants to save her energy. Advantages: Doesn\u00b4t feel pain! Doesn\u00b4t need to drink or eat!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.ibb.co/gp7XFa/Irene800.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Art\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e. I love building Aluben and having and idea of places and characters through illustrations. For some time I\u00b4ve been commissioning some of the best artists on both DeviantArt and Artstation to work on cities and characters of Aluben. Some of the artists I\u00b4ve worked with include Mario Wibisono, NeoArtCore and Jackson Tjota.\u003cbr\u003e. For a couple of months now I\u00b4ve also been contacted by lovely cosplayers and models that portrayed characters like Nicole and Elisa in photoshoots all across the world. Some of the cosplayers that worked with me so far are Anastasya Zelenova, Irene Astral, Captain Irachka and Beke Cosplay.\u003cbr\u003e. Most of the art money comes from myself, but I\u00b4m open to suggestions to invest the Patreon money on new artworks and photoshoots too, of both old and new characters of Aluben.
