    "summary": "Hello, and welcome to my Patreon page! My name is Alissa, and I am an illustrator and a writer. Most people know me because of my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://alissamarietart.tumblr.com\"\u003etumblr blog\u003c/a\u003e (previously beestiels, now alissamarietart,) Supernatural fanart and fanfiction, and my pin-ups of men in lingerie. I also do many original artworks and stories. Much of my work tends to be whimsical, and I draw inspiration from mythology, folklore, and pop culture, as well as celestial and animal imagery. Being part of the LGBT+ community also has a clear influence in my work, and the art of drag has been playing an increasing role in my illustrations as well.\u00a0I spend quite a bit of time expanding my body of work, and running my own\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://alissamarietart.etsy.com\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e (recently moved from Storenvy.) I also do \u003ca href=\"http://alissamarietart.tumblr.com/post/162402692518/commissions-are-open-33-slots-available\"\u003ecommissions\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://alissamarietart.tumblr.com/post/167269419243/2018-convention-schedule\"\u003econventions\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI used to have a part-time desk job that really had nothing to do with art. While it provided financial stability, it took out too much time and energy away from my ability to do art, and I realized I would never be able to advance with this Patreon, as well as take on illustration as a full career, while I was there. Tried as I had, my time was just split too many ways. I made the very difficult, but much-needed decision, to quit my day job in order to focus on illustration -and that is why my Patreon is more important to me now than ever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love what I do, commission work, convention sales, and online shop sales can be very financially unstable. However, I frequently have followers messaging me on\u00a0my personal tumblr asking for ways they can support me, other than commissions and my shop. This Patreon page is a way that you can support me for as little as $1 a month, and for me to have more stable financial support for my work. This will allow me to create more and better content, improve my Storenvy, and attend more conventions to sell my work in their artist alleys. Of course, it will also help me with all of life\u0027s average expenses, such food and bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy finished works are already, and will remain, available for free viewing at my previously mentioned personal blog, as well my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/alissamarietart\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://be.net/alissamarietart\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003emy Behance portfolio\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if my usual work will still be up for free viewing, what benefits will being a Patron give you? Becoming a Patron of my work can land you awesome things like charms, hand written notes from me, exclusive coupons to my shop, exclusive viewing access to sketches, WIPs, and unfinished works that I normally wouldn\u0027t post elsewhere, hand-signed prints, and the opportunity to see my illustrations in their high-resolution forms. You can even send me requests for what you\u0027d like to see me draw and write to have an influence on my creations! With enough support, I can take on bigger projects I\u0027ve been dreaming of doing, like creating mini art books, tarot decks, mini comics, and adult coloring books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you have fun joining me on this journey, and contributing to the eclectic art and stories that I create!"
