One night after a particularly rough set of classes, I decided to reimagine how I taught. I realized that I could use games to teach the complicated concepts of game theory in a simple and meaningful way. Then all my friends got jealous because they wanted to learn how to win at games too, and I came up with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://atomicgametheory.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAtomic Game Theory\u003c/a\u003e as a way to bring my classes to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46638435/Timeline.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to create content in all kinds of forms.
