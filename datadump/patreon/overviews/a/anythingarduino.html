I am Mikey :)\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a hard working dad of 6 living in Adelaide SA.\u003cbr\u003eI am obsessed with Anything Arduino and love\u003cbr\u003ethe open source community!\u00a0 So far, I have been tinkering\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ewith this in my spare time, however recently I have not been\u003cbr\u003eable to work.\u00a0 As I write this, it is early December 2017.\u00a0 Christmas\u00a0\u003cbr\u003etime is here and so I am making the most of anything I can get my\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ehands on.\u00a0 I have been buying small electronics from eBay and\u003cbr\u003emaking robots from household stuff and recycling stuff too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I have a few different series of robots. I am currently at a version 7 balancing robot, and a version 5 three-wheeled robot for example.\u00a0 These robots will continue to evolve over time, as I add features and improve the Arduino sketches.\u00a0 I have plans to convert a treadmill into a CNC, I am building an 18650 cell charger/discharger tester with capacity testing, etc.\u00a0 I have many projects on the go at any one time and tend to move from one to the next as best I can. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to start documenting my projects properly and sharing them with people, particularly with people who are now reaching out to me via Instagram and Facebook, to help them with Arduino projects of their own, and are asking me for schematics, sketches and help following my own robot projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have skills with Arduino, C programming, many types of sensors, motors and controllers, just to mention the directly relevant stuff. I also have a background in IT, electronics and ham radio, and I love helping people with all this stuff !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get a real buzz out of helping people, although I can not help everyone with everything and I will be honest about whether I have experience with particular technologies, I have an open mind and you may also find that if your enquiry or interest aligns with my own, that I may very well dive into said tech to learn about it.\u00a0 I am a generalist in IT and this headspace has always helped me survive around computers and electronics. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease consider supporting me, seriously, even the minimal amount will boost me more than I can describe.\u00a0 Early supporters will get plenty of attention from me, and for a small amount per month I would very much enjoy looking at your project or helping if I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e",
