Just click the \"Become a Patron\" Button on my page. Then you can select the desired amount you would like to pledge and can create a Patreon account so you can keep up with all my content and receive any rewards. You will receive a confirmation email and I will receive a notification that you are a new patron of mine. Also, keep in mind some tiers may ask for a shipping address which will be used by me to send rewards for that tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-When will I be charged as your patron?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon is set up on a monthly basis, so Patreon will charge whatever amount you selected at the beginning of every month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-Can I stop being a Patron?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNever! Haha, yes of course. If for some reason you would like to stop payments, there is an option to do that from any of the Patrons you support on your account. My Patrons are charged on a monthly basis so make sure that you unsubscribe after you have received the last of your rewards and before the next month processing begins.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e-Can I make a one time donation?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course you can! You can make a one time donation of any amount at any time. You would follow the same procedure as a patron. First create your Patreon account, click \"become a patron\" on my profile, fill in your desired donation amount, and then once your card has been successfully processed (Patreon does this the first week of every month) then you can simply drop me as a supported creator.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has an FAQ section as well for both Patrons and Creators if you have any questions specific to the site, billing, etc. Please feel free to message me if you have problems or further questions and I will respond promptly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

My dream would be to work in a big tech/science industry such as Google or Microsoft OR to work in the field of gaming and game design for companies like Hi-Rez, Blizzard, or Dice. In my spare time I enjoy playing video games, weightlifting, walking my Yorkie, practicing MMA, and creating art.",
