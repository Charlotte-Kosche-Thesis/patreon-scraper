Following Adam Novus as he struggles to find his place in the world at war on Mars. Struggling with survivor\u0027s guilt and building inner rage, he has no choice to but to follow the orders of his superiors, but for how long will he be able to keep his burning instincts for revenge at bay?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first 6 episode season came to an end in August of 2016 and production on season 2 has been underway since early January of 2017. Originally animated in Adobe Flash CS6, season 2 will be using Clip Studio Pro, and with that, a boost in overall quality in the animation style.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShattered Heaven started off as a novel series and currently has the original versions of the first and second novels available on Amazon. However, a revision of the first book, Sins of the Soul\u003cu\u003e \u003c/u\u003e\u00a0is due out in Summer of 2017. This book aligns with the animated series to prevent any disconnect between audiences.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shatteredheaven.com/patreon-line.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShattered Heaven has been a huge undertaking, one that has been completely been fueled by passion. The project is essentially a one man animation project. I\u0027m the only one handling the animatics and animation, in addition to the writing and casting and occasionally, the directing. I\u0027m extremely lucky to work with so many talented actors, actresses, sound designers and composers. But as the project grows, the more I realize that I need more time to devote to the project. Sadly, that is not something I can do with the limited amount of time that I have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon and the support of those who enjoy my work is one way to help supplement income to allow me to live and devote more time to the project. The project and any other animated web based project WILL ALWAYS BE FREE, but to improve and grow, this is a necessary step for me to take.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are some Shattered Heaven Videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShattered Heaven Season 1 Trailer\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wdf3V858zlw\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShattered Heaven Season 2 Clip Studio Test\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iRSwXYaBYbg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShattered Heaven Season 2 Promotional Video Animatic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MvRfaC9xqhk\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shatteredheaven.com/patreon-line.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://shatteredheaven.com/DS-patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat is Dragon Star?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDragon Star is a passion project written and created by Kira Buckland.

However, her interest in fellow student and pro gamer Hiroshi Tanaka leads her to join the after-school Competitive Gaming Club, where she trains to become a better player and navigates the complexity of social and romantic relationships within a tight-knit fighting game community.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only am I working on my own animated web series, I\u0027m also working on one for Kira Buckland.
