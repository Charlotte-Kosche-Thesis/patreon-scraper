In addition to the four issues per year of \u003cem\u003eThe Asexual\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0journal, which will focus on broad themes selected by ace people and for ace people, I would like to introduce a yearly issue that focuses on more specific topics or intersections within the ace community. This journal issue will be done in a similar manner to the other issues and will be released once per year (every Summer). This will be a yearly project because of the specificity of topic, which will mean it will take longer to receive publishable submissions. This will also take lots of additional time.",
