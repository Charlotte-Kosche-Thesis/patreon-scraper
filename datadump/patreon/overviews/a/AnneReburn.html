I\u2019m a musician and YouTuber and I\u2019m using Patreon to help me live my dream. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m asking you to join me as I make \u003cstrong\u003ea cover or vlog once a week\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0and as I work on \u003cstrong\u003elonger-term original music projects.\u003c/strong\u003e The money I get from Patreon will keep me from having to work a full-time \u201creal job\u201d so I have more time to dedicate to videos, and, if there\u2019s enough to go around, help me buy gear and hire people to \u003cstrong\u003emake my videos look and sound even better.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost covers on YouTube get recognized as copyrighted content (as they should be!), meaning I usually share my revenue with YouTube and the original creator. On Spotify and iTunes, I make about a penny for every 3 streams-- then I split that penny with a team of people. Bandcamp gives me about 73 cents on the dollar for the covers I sell there. These things don\u0027t pay the bills, but with the help of my patrons here, I\u0027ll be able to both pay the bills and make investments to improve the quality of my content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate anything and everything. I know not everyone is able to give money, but even your simple views on my videos are helpful, and honestly, very flattering. I can\u2019t think about it too much or I\u2019ll cry!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThank you \u003c/strong\u003efor coming this far with me-- now let\u0027s do something even bigger.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a list of the things I would like to do with money from Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunds permitting. Some are easier than others to accomplish; I would love to hear what you\u0027d like me to do first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u30fb\u003c/strong\u003eSet up and pay for a PO Box\u003cbr\u003e\u30fbPay for studio time to record\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u30fb\u003c/strong\u003ePay to have my songs professionally mixed and mastered\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u30fb\u003c/strong\u003ePay a percussionist to play with me, or buy some small percussion instruments that I can play (no more MIDI drums!)\u003cbr\u003e\u30fbPay photographers\u003cbr\u003e\u30fbAudio equipment upgrades: a new mic, preamp, vocal isolation screen, acoustic treatment for my home studio\u003cbr\u003e\u30fbVideo equipment upgrades: a new camera, better lights, gear to make vlogging easier both in and outside the house\u003cbr\u003e\u30fbHire designers to work with me on merch.
