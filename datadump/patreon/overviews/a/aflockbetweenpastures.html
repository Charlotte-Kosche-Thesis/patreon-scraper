    "summary": "Thank you so much for taking a look and considering being a supporter! I and my small rescue farm appreciate it very much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Summer and I\u0027m a Colorado based artist and art historian in training. I was involved in a severe car wreck back in July 2014 that left me with lifelong disabilities. A few months into my recovery, a tiny rooster adopted me and my two rescue dogs and started what is now A Flock Between Pastures (a small rescue farm that now consists of 32 chickens of various breeds and 6 peafowl).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, due to my disabilities, I was having difficulties with my Day Job - by that, I mean that I was forced to resign my position on June 2, 2017. I worked for a state government agency and no one in a position to do so would to do anything about the harassment and discrimination I had been dealing with for over a year by my coworkers and manager. It has been an extremely demoralizing experience to come back to a hostile work environment after a life altering car wreck, to not have the people who are supposed to stop harassment and discrimination stop it and blame you for it, and finally to be rejected again and again for potential jobs after you disclose you\u0027re disabled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in! As a patron, you will be helping to feed the animals of A Flock Between Pastures on a monthly basis and get access to merchandise and artwork at a discounted price, exclusive one-of-a-kind digital artwork, videos, and more. You can also \"sponsor\" any of the birds and get a monthly care package from them, if you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more on A Flock Between Pastures at the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.aflockbetweenpastures.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMain Blog - Updates on the Animals\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/odytherooster\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://society6.com/aflockbetweenpastures\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSociety6 Store\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://uzisuzuki.storenvy.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStorenvy Store\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.redbubble.com/people/uzisuzuki\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRedbubble Store\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
