I got over 100 thousand views on my channel in one month this year and I only made 13 dollars in adsene earnings! Youtube is my fulltime job and its getting to the point where I the money I make with adsense is not enough to get by.

     "about": "For the past 2 and a half years I have been a full time content creator. Both on twitter, YouTube, and various other platforms. I used to make about 1.5k a month in donations from platforms outside of YouTube and in all honesty at the age of 15 that was a lot of money for me to live off of. In October of 2017 I lost my Youtube channel due to malicious reporting from Neo-nazis and other far-right bigots. I am currently in the process of rebuilding my brand and name online under a new channel as well as many other platforms that I have joined. I had very big intentions for my old YouTube channel. My goal was that once i hit 10k subs I was gonna start traveling state to state and LIVE stream at political events. I intended on going to Alt-right rallies, KKK protests, communist marches, anti-gun rallies, Black Lives Matter marches, and even pro and anti-abortion marches. Just about anything controversial. My intentions in doing that STILL STAND. But in order for me to bring you guys awesome content I need financial support. It will be very expensive to travel state to state via plane, pay for a motel/hotel room, and pay the uber fees to get to the marches. I cannot do this alone. I am currently looking for work now that I have lost my main source of income after my YouTube termination. Please help me reach my goal of 1.5k a month so that I will be able to continue to do the work that I love to do as well as provide awesome content for my viewers/fans. Any amount is greatly appreciated. Check out my tiers and choose any one that best suites you. Thank you to all those who will help.",
