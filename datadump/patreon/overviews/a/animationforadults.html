We are \u003cstrong\u003eTeam AFA.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0We love animation- and that\u0027s why we created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.animationforadults.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAFA: Animation For Adults,\u003c/a\u003e a site and podcast for people just like us. We bring animation fans the latest news, reviews and articles covering everything from mainstream Hollywood fare (\u003cstrong\u003ePixar, Disney,\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eDreamWorks\u003c/strong\u003e etc) and anime to independent and web animation. We believe animation is a medium (note: definitely not a \u003cem\u003egenre\u003c/em\u003e) that deserves as much respect as any other part of the film or TV industry, and animation fans deserve a site that gives it just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a weekly podcast too that covers a wide range of animation topics, and we will be launching original video content too, in the not-so distant future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, we can do even more. More news, more reviews, more articles, interviews and more frequent updates. Unfortunately, the time when a small independent site like ours could get by on advertising alone seem to have passed. With the site currently not making money, we are limited in the content we can produce (as they say, time is money). But we promise that if you can help us out we can together make AFA into the site that animation and animation fans deserve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generous Donations will be put towards things including (but not limited to)\u003cbr\u003e* Site costs and overheads (hosting, Patreon fees etc)\u003cbr\u003e* Compensating our writers for their work\u003cbr\u003e* Covering a wider range of titles and events\u003cbr\u003e* additional podcasts and video content (coming soon).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe feel our time is best spent creating content for the site for everyone, but we\u0027d also be happy to hear your ideas for Patron exclusives we can offer in future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up today and you can download our interview with double Oscar nominated \u003cstrong\u003eSong Of The Sea \u003c/strong\u003edirector, \u003cstrong\u003eTomm Moore \u003c/strong\u003eas your first reward!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
