    "summary": "I was born in Reno, NV, living in South Lake Tahoe, CA until she was 12 and then moving with her family to Salem, OR. She had lived for a decade in Kissimmee / Saint Cloud, FL., but found that she had longed to be in the great Northwest. Here Sheryl found inspiration in the grand landscapes and beauty in the changing seasons that Florida just couldn\u2019t provide. I\u0027m self taught with an educational background as well. A great portion of my influence is from the world around me. I love to go on day trips into nature. There is a lovely place called Silver falls here in Oregon, that is just so breathtaking. When I was in my younger teen years I worked on creatures and mythical beings in a fantasy world, but pursued landscape art for a good 20 years, studying the way nature tells a story in its elegance, before coming back to my first love of fantasy creations. Through my work in landscapes I enjoyed expressing the serenity of the world around us and the calmness it provides in the world of chaos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014, I decided to pursue a long time desire to sell my work and share it with the world. I have earned a BA in graphic design / visual communication and applied the love of art through visual presentation for a decade. Now I spends my time bringing to life the ideas of others.I enjoy working with authors to express their vision, along with the idea of many individuals who have an idea they wish to come to life. On days when I\u0027m not working in my studio, I works in a childhood and adolescent mental health office. I\u0027m a firm believer in providing therapy that expresses feelings through the process of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to bring to life creatures and ethereal beings while also placing her characters in captivating surroundings. To build her skill into combining both her fantasy world with her landscape. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
