    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003eWelcome to the Major Arcanium Gazette, an entertainment platform that\u0027s more than just a magazine.  We\u0027re aiming for \"megazine\" with all kinds of fun stuff thrown in illustrated by crackerjack artist,  Martin Cameron, and writer Robert E. Vardeman.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHow it works:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eEvery week a new illustrated installment in Millard Fillmore, Master of Steam (a steampunk tale, dontcha know?) will zip your way for ... FREE! The serial story follows a wild variety of characters, ranging from former president Millard Fillmore, trying to find a steamdog creation, Fulton, who can shed light on how the White House happened to blow up (yes, Millard was blamed).  Millard has tracked Fulton to the air-pirate festooned Monument Valley Free Zone, riding a new creation, the steamhorse This Horse, who slowly is gaining sentience.  Hunting Millard is his nemesis, Thurlow Weed.  Millard and This Horse rescue 250-year-old Virginia Dare as she hunts for the meaning of CROATOAN and... lots, lots more as the serial unwinds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eIf this isn\u0027t enough, and you are willing to show your appreciation for the free serial, every month will see a complete magazine containing a brand spanking new steampunk serial episode following air pirates Reggie Fairweather, Lady Amy and the nefarious Duchess with her Jade Unicorn Horn (really, really, amazingly illustrated!).  And also in this $5 issue will be two new fantasy or sf short stories, crazy filler items for products you wish existed, readers\u0027 correspondence and pages ripped from journals written by air pirates of the Golden West, as well as the chance to guide the course of the stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eBut wait!  There\u0027s more.  If you really want the full meal, the complete dinner, the big kahuna, a buffet beyond belief, the $5 issue has all the above plus an early look at the next four episodes of Millard episodes \u003cem\u003eplus\u003c/em\u003e a serialized sf novel.\u00a0 Yes, you get to see it all before the freeloaders!\u00a0 You\u0027re special.\u00a0 You\u0027re a MAJOR ARCANIUM GAZETTE patron!\u00a0 Those subscribing at this level will get the chance to vote on new products, get discounts on fiction and ... what would you like?  Drop us a $5 sub and let us know!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHonest disclaimer.  Martin and I have put a lot of work into this project already and will work even harder\u2013if you reward us.  We\u0027re like mules.  Dangle a carrot in front of us and we will keep pulling the cart through a weird and wondrous world.  Or should that be like steammules?  Carrots don\u0027t work as well as reaching the monthly stretch goal of\u00a0 525 patrons.  Hit that lofty readership and, yes,\u003cem\u003e you \u003c/em\u003eget more.

In a world where so much is rigidly defined Steampunk is only limited by the dreams and fantasies of the artisans and fans of the genre.\u003cbr\u003eIt is into this world that noted Science Fiction/Fantasy/western writer Robert E. Vardeman and Artist/animator Martin G Cameron are launching MAJOR ARCANIUM GAZETTE, a Penny Dreadful published by one of the main suppliers of Components to Aeronauts the world over. More than a simple graphic novel, but at times containing some of the finer aspects of that milieu , MAJOR ARCANIUM GAZETTE is intended to Entertain and inform all aspects of the Aeronautical community. \u003cbr\u003eThe Magazine will be published initially in electric telegraphic form, eventually leading to a more traditional pulp format as time and resources allow. In its pages readers will be amazed by tales of the daring exploits of the SKY PIRATES OF THE GOLDEN WEST as well as other serialized wonders. Additionally in the PICAYUNE\u2019s pages will feature technical articles regarding the care and operation of the aeronautical ephemera produced by ARCANIUM ENGINEERING as well as question and answer column concerning the operation of earlier models. Additionally there will be advice columns of a more personal nature well as advertisements from purveyors of wares of interest of everyone in the aeronautical community.\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally Mssr. Vardeman\u0026amp;Cameron will be also producing the Light Novel Serial MILLARD FILLMORE, MASTER OF STEAM, which feature the adventures Millard Fillmore, the only ex-President to blow up the White House, Virginia Dare, Steam Alchemist and the first white child born in America along with a Six legged talking horse and Nikola Tesla thrown in for good measure.\u003cbr\u003eAs we launch into this noble endeavor we find that we have a select number of openings for pre-publication investors as well as offering readers the opportunity to subscribe in advance of publication. Those Bright Stars who undertake to throw their lot in with us will find themselves exposed to a broad array of materials available to no one other themselves and their fellows. Supporters will also receive occasional special offers on ARCANIUM ENGINEERING materials and Ephemera.\u003cbr\u003eSo won\u2019t you strap on your peacemaker, turn your imagination to eleven and join us in skies above the American West, where the sky is so blue you need goggles and anything is possible?\u003cbr\u003e"
