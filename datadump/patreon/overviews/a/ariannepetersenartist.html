Though you can call me Ari.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an artist and a storyteller. I tell stories through my art and I make art by telling stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat was poetic, but how about something a little...more specific?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI paint, I draw, and I write. I am both self-taught and classically trained in art (I do have a relatively expensive BFA). I have taken a few courses in writing and storytelling, but that part of my life is mostly self-taught.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I paint, it is primarily in acrylics on either cotton paper or stretched canvas. When I draw, it is primarily in graphite on paper. And when I write...well that varies a lot more. I write poetry, prose fiction, graphic novels (mostly fantasy adventure), and tabletop rpg game modules (specifically for the D\u0026amp;D game system).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u2019s a lot of stuff, is that all going to be here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. The game modules will not have a presence here. And at present, neither will the poetry or prose fiction. What will be here are the paintings, the drawings, and the graphic novels!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStill sounds like a lot of variety. Why not pare down?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I\u2019ve tried and I just can\u2019t give any of it up. This was actually a struggle I had in college. My professors kept saying \u201cYou need to define your art, pick one thing!\u201d And I would try to just \u201cpick one\u201d but wound up being unable to keep my focus and inspiration, and then became frustrated and generally unhappy. After I graduated and started meeting other working artists who did multiple things, I realized I didn\u2019t have to keep fighting what felt natural. Some artists are better doing one thing, others are better doing multiple things. I\u2019m an artist that needs a variety of ways to express my creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/rp3SvcqeMVEEVNQrzqrJq_ENMyQU1rs77G5MxzesHuG9YueuYcjHTf7Tgq9yUhzqbyZYXV7fWDQmjBdhPGZq5Q1F15R80gig7JofhUK5Gk_KS2CVTbMGPyNewd8i3TNmpdQNHnvs-NVGxU136NAFgGTr1ST9036PgC8entWVpg4jA9_fiqwBI4_LGTmdPllxMvM9rZ2gVazbuFwgea2npQJ0pc47L7Ml8k8J7-ujcGUl42gIsKwVtot7QdXJTuuQJ2gRkzhF6QK8oRfeeffjJqsEspvMxZx-1Sew2PCxDCXoNocn0CrjDw-IiiTW3wCKDFE4e90PLooN-pn_cVbBa-TczHZ2m5Dgz31DAmOW63tRZ_OuwRMThb13tW5de2sF3-UbMqw5Z3IChb1_S2HnZki68WSLU1G2OH7vuC2ljAXFhtD7zJKpgz2QKT2Ac_GV9gMkfkbXnkkyG2IoSpK8GMkxQd1kP_066TtXKQ8-3QMqNLdS2UzbmNKAQJgepBWE_VT6lcwAgWediJjZddFUVYOCUj18arqkaztXZdFIe4cLWyNg3VI0ivd-Ugn9etKY-fTqfwXCjKIP3gDohOQ3jVyxrHEW8HTqztTUJB8=w621-h224-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEver since I was little, I have wanted to financially support myself as an artist. I had no delusions going into this endeavor. Growing up, my parents were supportive yet realistic with me. I always knew it would take time to get to that point, and along the way I would have to supplement with other jobs and sources of income. At this point in my life, I am ready to start making my career as an artist more of a priority than the other jobs that I needed to do to pay my bills. But I still need to pay said bills. I\u2019ve been hearing about Patreon for a while and it sounded like exactly what I was looking for; a platform for me to share my creative work that also allows people who like my work to supply funds to support my creation of said work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what kind of content will be here, on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will have access to my weekly sketchbook, works-in-progress, and the opportunity to vote on some of my upcoming projects. I will also offer closer looks into my process. Patrons will also receive special monthly discount codes to purchase artworks, and higher level patrons will receive limited edition prints and commission discounts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I going to use the funds from Patreon on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it simply: supplies and bills. Paper, canvas, paints, brushes, pencils, etc. are all vital to what I do and need to be replenished on a regular basis. There\u2019s also service fees for my artist website, entrance fees for contests, exhibition shows, and other events to get my name and my art out there in the world. And then there\u2019s the other stuff like food, water, electricity, car maintenance, and taking care of my catnip-loving cat and dogs. Seriously, the dogs keep taking the catnip away from the cat. I don\u2019t get it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat sounds great! How do you become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s easy! See that orange button on the top right of my page? It says \"\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\". Click that button and then you\u0027ll get to select your reward tier and how much you want to pay per month. The reward tiers are listed in detail below the button and on the patron checkout page. But you don\u0027t have to pick any rewards if you don\u0027t want to! There is a no reward option available. You can also customize how much you want to pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor example\u003c/strong\u003e, say you want to pay $10/month, which would get you everything included in the Intermediate Tier. But maybe you\u0027re only interested in the rewards from the Intro and Beginner Tiers. You would then select the Beginner Tier reward (the highest of the rewards you are interested in) and increase the dollar amount from $5 to $10.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo thank you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor stopping by my Patreon page and checking things out, I am very grateful. I hope you consider supporting me (patron rewards start at just $1/month!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GQ60LRq_YrpxT1udsI0KgnyAKpRyo6M0kbKLf5xcWVWfC9L7JsEe4qhe_yQKrRiTIrHXsg7k1RlmNNsQ4Qc1ybb_66VlK2wrhh5tIA14Evo25Mw7AVs7P__mB6Goa6TvOnshKd-oGNwT9W8W-IBOZN7_QQN5PUou__4ePsZKRhioJfJqHsikwU2g9xQt156HWDOhK_w6hgHpAY3vM9bBqviKRz4a0X9wNoXJb-bptAT7vEEqN_WeVnIXE97xM0IoTY4CkcDjdXKlvDhX20HVDVAVyy9Ps9ve34BYoRiuYqfHDfasmHBVF7jcihlD1VD1YJJuBwNA8j7pCiB5rwAsAwp87O3zQ9Im_BPSKFH8Un56xlneDeXgvJpltlz2-_svr54IQZ86uHJ4wd1R3wzrmsuCo2cOYHG6HGbr_rHjXnvIk950Am93AIZlDxsrIEPzMIJmRsWY2xaW0gWlP8blh65KExztoNowoozTCaFjh0VQNWZ3CQ77i4Ng25NpbRdFxNwaF-WUSqW5ZE7UzmmROJPUoWwPIDHidaiiiA4B-iTIgUt4vzUxNxHkArnMM_JouMG-FVU1LCaPoZTq5f6nzn3OOPk3j8URQ0DXaFE=w1600-h577-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther places to find me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AriannePetersenArtist\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/AriannePetersenArtist\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFine Art Studio Online: \u003ca href=\"http://ari89.fineartstudioonline.com\"\u003ehttp://ari89.fineartstudioonline.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSquare Store:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fstore%2Farianne-petersen-artist\u0026amp;h=ATPg6Zpy_T9gwcTFuDfUr6StXHtIwjRTizbkVoUXkDCKmc46DLMCadu_BcO4L0UIDDmF2JjzQH4I_jammDYLxU6i__zMx4UGxm3XYl62-MOCAWlh5KaXDdalFHDxtT-cZ1xaoIS11Kg_yglo4-d8duEK4kQYaY5D-qWqez3Zpboj3Y0yJvSlaCnZa1zZEBJ3_IXegI9m21TBAXh_eUuFfeRwYaSfP7nYyfmv_k25QpeSdvYQ6jn9lkX_94JDkOfxIy9BL9sgBET1viHpdomIjwNpWAgVf_szE2fSNmOvjnFId-yOulo6ylvfblDYFmE\"\u003ehttps://squareup.com/store/arianne-petersen-artist\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSociety6: \u003ca href=\"https://society6.com/ariannepetersenartist\"\u003ehttps://society6.com/ariannepetersenartist\u003c/a\u003e"
