    "summary": "Hey there! If you\u0027re reading this I assume you\u0027re already a little bit familiar with us but if not allow us to introduce ourselves. Alamodome Audible was launched two years ago in an attempt to bring UTSA fans a fun and authentic podcast that\u0027s informative enough for diehards and welcoming enough for the most casual of fans. While we primarily focus on covering UTSA, we aim to be entertaining enough to attract listeners with no personal attachment to the Roadrunners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been an absolute blast to build a relationship with our community over the past two years and turn podcast listeners into close friends. Together we\u0027ve watched the UTSA program come a long way -- from team photos of a three-win Larry Coker team in the basketball gym to upsetting a Big XII team on the road under the direction of the hottest G5 coach in college football.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust as the Roadrunners have stepped up their commitment to their football program, it\u0027s time for us to increase our commitment to you, our listeners. We\u0027ve created this Patreon in order to give you all an opportunity to contribute your financial support directly to the voices you hear in your headphones each week. With Soundcloud\u0027s future looking more apocalyptic by the day, we\u0027re planning to move our podcast to a more secure host and your support will help us realize this goal. Moving hosting services will increase the avenues through which you\u0027re able to follow our podcasts including, yes, iTunes (finally!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChange is scary but rest assured that the roots of the show will remain the same. We\u0027re still going to preview and breakdown each game. We\u0027re still going to have fire intro tracks. We\u0027re still going to make fun of Mason Fine, who is 5\u00279\". Ultimately, we\u0027re aiming to bring you all more content on a more regular schedule with more accessibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose that choose to support us in our efforts will be rewarded with exclusive bonuses for subscribers. These rewards will be on a tier system with more perks being unlocked as you increase your donation level. Afraid of commitment? Your subscription level can be increased, decreased, or outright canceled at any time. If you\u0027re unable to contribute financially don\u0027t sweat it; we\u0027re still going to be bringing y\u0027all the UTSA podcast you deserve free of charge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support! #BirdsUp"
