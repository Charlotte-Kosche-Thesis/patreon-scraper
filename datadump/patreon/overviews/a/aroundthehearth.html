Every week, we\u0027ll be bringing you our thoughts on the Standard and Wild metas, the recent happenings on the tournament scene, and our take on the game as a whole; not to mention, our deck of the week feature where we go in-depth on what we\u0027ve been playing that week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, \u003c/strong\u003ewe need some help from you. We are just starting out and doing this purely out of a love for the game, and as such there are a few costs that need paying: paying a graphic designer for logos and artwork, paying for storage space to host the cast itself, and paying for a small amount of promotion to get ourselves out there a little bit more. We are two dads and a student (guess which is which!), and so we don\u0027t have too much to put into the podcast. And this... is where you come in. If you have watched or listened to and enjoyed the podcast and would like to support us, then any amount you are willing to give is so hugely appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNaturally, \u003c/strong\u003ewe\u0027ll try and make it worth your while: we\u0027ll give you a shout-out on the show and our Thank You page, and all of the guys playing on your server will add you to their friends list (all 3 play on NA, EvilSquirrel does not play on Europe, and only rebobson plays on Asia) for some friendly games, you might even get an 80G quest or two out of it! There will be some more rewards if you are so inclined to give more: there will be opportunities for the biggest donors to join us on the show, either in the form of a live-streamed match against us, or making a special guest appearance on the cast itself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut genuinely, anything and everything is hugely appreciated, any amount of support right now will help us go a long way. Thank you for reading, and we hope to see you either in the Twitch chat while we stream, or maybe even on the show itself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBig love,\u003cbr\u003eATH\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
