    "summary": "Hello, if you\u0027re here, you probably already know what you\u0027re doing! If not, then this little box of text is here to help convince you to become my patron.\u003cbr\u003eAs for introductions, I am Advon Koulthar, one interested in creating stories, but what I am best at is writing. For the foreseeable future, I am working on Friendly Neighborhood Necromancer, a free web serial found on Royal Road Legends. In less technical terms, a \u00a0stream of chapters is released, instead of one book every once in a blue moon. If you managed to get here without reading it, take a look and see if you like it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s so much content at no cost to you! Too bad I require sustenance, and free stories don\u0027t provide such a thing. Luckily there are people like you who are interested in keeping me alive and maintaining my access to the Internet. Plus who isn\u0027t motivated by the thought of monetary compensation? I know I am!\u003cbr\u003eSo please, if your pockets are not as empty as mine, please donate! The writing may be free, but you\u0027ll get special behind-the-scenes information, the ability to request a Sidestory, or even make suggestions for future characters. I thank you for your patronage!\u003cbr\u003eThings have changed to releasing only 1 chapter a week. To reflect the drop in content, and my occasional inconsistencies, I\u0027ve changed the payment to \u0027Per Creation\u0027. I don\u0027t know how that works yet, but I think every 10th chapter would be fair(not including sidestory chapters ie 90.1, 90.2)\u003cbr\u003e"
