    "summary": "Currently on trial in the UK for singing politically incorrect songs, I am charged with four counts of sending and causing to be sent \u0027grossly offensive\u0027 messages under the Communications Act. My case has been ongoing for almost a year during which time I have been on bail with a gagging order which restricts my movements as well as my freedom of speech.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA professionally trained musician, I worked as a teacher and performer in Switzerland before returning to my English roots in 2012. In 2015, Swiss-British publisher, Gerard Menuhin, sent me the lyrics to a poem \u0027Tell Me More Lies\u0027 which I set to music and which then became the inspiration for my \u0027Songs of the Shoah\u0027 series of satirical songs about the \u0027Holocaust\u0027. A 40 minute show put together for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2016 was pulled following political pressure from the Israel lobby. I finally was able to perform my show last September at the Grosvenor Hotel in London at a meeting of the London Forum where I received a standing ovation from an audience of over 100 patriots.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy court case concerns a shared YouTube video of my London Forum performance. Still at the legal argument stage, the prosecution must now prove that online sharing constitutes sending or causing to be sent a \u0027grossly offensive\u0027 message. If I am found guilty, my case will set a precedent which will effectively outlaw any criticism, questioning - satirical or otherwise - of the orthodox \u0027Holocaust\u0027 narrative. Banned from Twitter, unable to perform live and heavily censored on YouTube with the attacks now concentrating on my PayPal account, I need a safe place where I can continue to express myself and find support. I am now able to accept donations and pledges with both PayPal and BitCoin.\u003cbr\u003e"
