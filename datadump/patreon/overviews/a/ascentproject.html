The songs they produce push the boundaries of creativity while still providing singable songs for churches all over. From deep, devotional songs to high-energy worship anthems, their music breathes life and truth into all generations and walks of life.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_iqWXDey0d8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHey guys... welcome to our Patreon page! Over the last couple of years we\u0027ve had the amazing privilege to lead worship, write and record songs, and share them with you! We couldn\u0027t be more grateful for your support, encouragement, and prayers. God has placed some exciting dreams on our hearts to continue this journey and we want you guys to be a part of it all! We\u0027ve always wanted Ascent Project to be more of a movement than just a band and your involvement and support is so critical to that. We love you all! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPatreon is a great platform for you to partner with us on a monthly basis so that we can have the income and finances needed to make this Ascent Project thing happen. By pledging a monthly amount of any kind (seriously, any amount helps!), you will give us the financial means to pull off our plan for this next year!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the plan.... \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly release of new singles to iTunes, Spotify and all digital outlets\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRegular worship videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMonthly worship gatherings to unify the church\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCampaign to transform a village in need in Guatemala\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eStarting in early October we will be releasing a brand new single, fully produced, every month. Our first one, \"Stand On The Empty Grave\" will be released on iTunes, Spotify, and all other digital outlets on October 10th and we couldn\u0027t be more excited! We also will be releasing an acoustic video of this song shot live in Gautemala! The more we work on these new songs the more anxious we are for you to hear them! We may even have a Christmas song in the works for later this year ;) We believe for this season that releasing singles regularly is the best way for us to stay connected to you, and to give the church fresh new songs! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe will also be putting on monthly worship nights at theaters and concert venues in Fort Collins. We believe the church should be the most united group of people on Earth, so we want to facilitate nights to gather the church of Northern Colorado in worship. These events will be dedicated to putting aside differences and lifting high the name of Jesus in places where it wouldn\u2019t normally be heard. These will be nights of outreach, hope, and love to reach people with the Gospel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the same day that we release \"Stand On the Empty Grave\", we will be launching a huge campaign to completely transform a village in Guatemala. \u003cem\u003eVolcancito Arriba\u003c/em\u003e is a small, remote village, high in the mountains of Guatemala. We had the amazing opportunity to visit the precious people living in the village thanks to amazing organizations like World Help and Hope of Life. We want our music, our worship, our movement to make a lasting impact around the globe, and this is our chance to do just that. We can be the hands and feet of Jesus, bringing the hope of the Gospel along with clean water and other vital resources. By supporting us on Patreon, you will be a vital part in providing \u003cem\u003eVolcancito Arriba\u003c/em\u003e with clean water, a safe church building, schooling, and more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading... we seriously can\u0027t wait to see all that God does! We have so much passion and excitement for this dream God has put on our hearts. We ask that you would consider partnering with us as we make a difference for his kingdom!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU. THANK YOU.
