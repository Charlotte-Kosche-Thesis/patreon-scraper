I\u0027m Amelia, and welcome to the Patreon page for\u00a0Aki-rain Art!\u00a0I hail from the Pacific Northwest region of the US, and I\u0027m highly interested in drawing animals - particularly birds and anthropomorphic characters. Currently, I\u0027m an Illustration student in college. And obviously, college is no small investment, in terms of time or money. For the past few years I\u0027ve been able to allocate time in between class and work for commissions, but building a solid online presence is a very slow process, and it simply wouldn\u0027t be possible for me to support myself solely on one-off commissions. That\u0027s why I started a Patreon. I dedicate most of my waking hours not already spent on college, work or necessities to turning my art into my career, and there\u0027s so much more to my work than just the finished pieces I post on sites like Twitter and FurAffinity. And now by becoming a patron, you can see it all, and get a more personalized view of my artistic practice!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges from Patreon will enable me to...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAllocate more time to sustaining my art business and reaching a wider audience\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEnable me to invest in a wider variety of products that are more time-efficient, such as merchandise, and more opportunities for smaller or special commissions\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHelp me continue to pay for supplies and my business alongside college expenses and student loans\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd by becoming a patron, YOU can get exclusive access to all sorts of sketchbook pages and work-in-progress images!
