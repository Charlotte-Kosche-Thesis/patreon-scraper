    "summary": "Sup all you lovely scoundrels out in the universe and such,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am AstralTempest, a writer. Yeah, that thing where you put words on paper and shove it down peoples\u0027 eyeballs. Anyway, I currently write a web serial called Hidden Forge: Lucem Ac Tenebras. The story focuses on a young man who can travel between a world of magic and a near future Earth. In the process, he aims to become the strongest blacksmith of all time, though such a goal is far easier said than done. For now, it updates every Saturday and sometimes has an extra during the week (though patrons will have early access and all that wonderfulness). \u003cstrong\u003eNote: Currently working on rewriting Hidden Forge Book One. Until I am caught up again, it is on hiatus. However, you can read the progress here or the public releases on\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://creativenovels.com/novel/hidden-forge-lucem-ac-tenebras/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecreative-novels\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a second project, I also write a LitRPG story called Ancientblood. The story focuses on a former Drill Instructor who suddenly finds himself in a world with an RPGesque system. The releases are Monday, Wednesday, and Friday publicly, but there will be advance chapters for patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you so choose to cough up your dollars and cents to this humble *coughs blood* writer, than I sincerely *coughs more blood* thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNotice: For those who have pledged, check the pinned tag \"gdoc\" to look for early access documents.\u003c/strong\u003e"
