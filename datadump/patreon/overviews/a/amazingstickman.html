    "summary": "I\u0027ve already brought the show across 4 continents, living and funding the tours almost entirely off audience donations. This has been done without government grants, or arts funding. In today\u0027s climate on visa controls and immigration requirements for performers I\u0027m being told I\u0027m not allowed to accept donations \u00a0in \"some\" countries. Thankfully this isn\u0027t the case for international performers in my home country of Canada, and hope it never will be. That doesn\u0027t mean I want to stop doing what I love. Inspiring young people and scaring the parents (Just a bit!)\u00a0around the globe. \u00a0Your donations will help to make that possible!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe recent tours have mostly been done with motorcycles, pulling a 320 pound show trailer. Last motorcycle tour was to complete the goal of performing in every state of Australia. I\u0027ve had the joy and honor of performing for hill tribe families in the mountains in Indonesia, teaching stick juggling to monks in Laos, performing to aid charities for street kids in Thailand to name a few. Recently a travel author and friend wanted to join the tour and publish part of the \u00a0journey. Already have a mention in his last book and his publisher was all for it. Do to lack of funds, the project had to scraped for the time being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next installment was sailing a 9 meter catalac 900 catamaran. It\u0027s taken everything I had to purchase it last year, and the goal is to sail to places I could never be able to get to on a motorcycle. I\u0027ve already covered coast and Isles of Spain, and then headed towards the Atlantic ocean and up across the Bay of Biscay and into the heart of London. Visa allowances won\u0027t allow me to remain in Europe for more than 3 months, so this was interesting. Spent some time stranded in Ceuta, after an incident in the Strait of Gibraltar. \u00a0 Although I dreamed of \u00a0Morocco, since I\u0027ve heard rumors of snake charmers and old school vakirs. I wasn\u0027t able to afford to perform along with them. \u00a0Been offered a chance to do perform in India instead as a white Vakir! Of course it\u0027ll continue from there. Suggestions are always welcome, especially places that have never seen street shows before. Of course your donations will help to bring me to places where the monetary donations aren\u0027t part of the equation, but people still want to be part of the experience. I\u0027ve only ever asked people to give what they can afford, and I always give more than I ever receive. Hope you can be part of the journey. Wether it be by boat/motorcycle/plane/train or Rickshaw.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStickman\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
