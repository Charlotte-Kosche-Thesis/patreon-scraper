    "summary": "I go by Aino Terran in various parts of the web, and I enjoy\nwriting on politics and social issues. I run the blog at \u003ca href=\"http://fellowtravelers.net/\"\u003ehttp://fellowtravelers.net/\u003c/a\u003e if you are\ninterested in seeing my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat I hope to get from Patreon is simple. Freedom, and\nperhaps a bit of motivation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe freedom aspect comes from two sources. First, if I have\na bit of income coming in from this page, even a little, I can use that to pay\noff the various debts that I have accumulated. I am an American, where debt is\na way of life. I would love to break free from that cycle.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSecondly, I want to get more aggressive about my writing,\nand the people around me will take that more seriously if it is contributing to\npaying the bills in some way.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is also highly motivating to know that people are actually interested in your work. I love to\nproduce things that are of use to others, and I love when people provide\nfeedback on my work. Dialogue is the key to\nsuccess in so many ways.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNow, to get a little political. It is impossible not to\nreally, as you will see if you follow the link above. I see the world through a\nparticular lens. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a leftist. I am an Anarcho-Socialist. I realize those\nthings mean different things to different people, but if I do my job right with\nthis page, then it won\u0027t take you long to figure out what it means to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am passionate about race and gender issues. I am\npassionate about issues of state abuses. I am passionate about learning and\neducating people on social issues, history, politics, and economics.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am a techie.\nSometimes I am super involved in the tech world, and sometimes not so much. I\noccasionally get excited about things like new Linux distros, and command line\ntools. I also realize that there is a lot of overlap between the tech community\nand my other communities of interest. If you are not into tech, and I\noccasionally make posts about a recent development\nor my current projects, please bear with me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMost of all, though, I am human. I have made mistakes in\npast, and am guaranteed to make mistakes in the future. I will try not to screw\nup, but if I do, I will do my best to fix myself and learn from my mistakes.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome of you are probably wondering what to expect from this\nPatreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe link above is my blog. As you have probably already\nseen, I have not been 100% consistent in the\npast. I want to change that. My goal is to produce at least two good\nposts a month. As I get better at integrating writing time into my schedule, I\nwill try to increase this. My patrons, of course, will get to see new posts a\nfew days before the general public.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also hope to write a few books. These are projects that\nhave been sitting on the back burner longer than I would like, and I want to\nget back to them. A mix of fiction and non-fiction. If there is sufficient\ninterest there, I will make status reports and chapters available to my patrons\nas well.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAgain, welcome to my page. I hope that I do not disappoint\nyou.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
