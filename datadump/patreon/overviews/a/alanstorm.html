    "summary": "Hi!  My name\u0027s Alan Storm. I\u0027m a software engineer living in Portland, OR. I\u0027ve been writing about open source technology for over 10 years. You probably found me because of my work in the PHP and Magento worlds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe genesis of this Patreon was to help fund to completion of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://store.pulsestorm.net/products/no-frills-magento-2-layout\"\u003eNo Frills Magento 2 Layout\u003c/a\u003e, a book that started as a small update to the original \u003cem\u003eNo Frills Magento Layout\u003c/em\u003e but ended up taking on a life of its own.  I\u0027m happy to say that the book\u0027s done, shipped to patrons, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://store.pulsestorm.net/products/no-frills-magento-2-layout\"\u003eavailable for the general public to purchase\u003c/a\u003e.  If you or your team are taking on a Magento 2 project this book will lay the foundation for your understanding of Magento\u0027s new frontend systems.  In other words\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://store.pulsestorm.net/products/no-frills-magento-2-layout\"\u003ebuy it now\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith its original goal completed, this patreon\u0027s going to shift focus over the coming months.  Right now, my four main goals are\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue writing about open source programming topics on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://alanstorm.com/\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e and other programming communities (Stack Overflow, the patron membership Slack, etc.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelop an open source ebook (ePub, kindle, etc.) publishing workflow/template to turn my existing blog articles into something more mobile/tablet/kindle friendly\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvestigate creating formal programming screencasts, starting with No Frills Magento 2 Layout content or general Magento development using pestle\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue to manage and improve\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://github.com/astorm/pestle\"\u003epestle\u003c/a\u003e, the opens source PHP CLI tool framework, and Magento 2 code generation tool.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWorking on a new, PHP based open-source project I\u0027m not ready to talk about yet (patrons -- keep your eyes on your the blog/your email for more information)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll have more to say about this in the coming weeks and months, but with No Frills done I wanted to make sure my intent here was clear. Thank you again for your support, and for helping me do what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot a subscriber?\u00a0 Here\u0027s what you\u0027re missing out on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlack Office Hours\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt least two days a week I\u0027ll make myself available in a semi-private slack channel to answer patron\u0027s questions about Magento, PHP, or any other technical topic. This isn\u0027t consulting -- think of it more like a college professor or peer who can help you better understand your problem, and get you pointed in the right direction towards a solution. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAccess to Website Articles as an Ebook\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I complete and release (as open source), a template and process for publishing technical books via pandoc, patrons will get access to already published articles on my website in ebook format. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEarly/Free Access to Screencast Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I work on screencasts, patrons at the $25 level will be the first to see them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePick a Topic\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons at the highest level get to chose a topic for me to cover in my usual style. This may be a specific issue you\u0027re having trouble with, or may be a broad general system of Magento or some other PHP framework. Again, this is not consulting. We\u0027ll need to have some back and forth to make sure I\u0027ll be publishing an article that\u0027s as interesting to you as it is to me and the general community.  While I won\u0027t be able to guarantee a specific delivery date, all patrons will receive in-progress updates as I research and write the article(s) on your topic.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://alanstorm.com/contact/\"\u003eGet in touch after\u003c/a\u003e (or before!) subscribing if you\u0027re interested in this level. \u003cbr\u003e"
