    "summary": "As an art historian I have always envied artists in the time of the High Renaissance. They had patrons who believed in them and their art and wanted the artists to go on making. I\u0027ve always wanted to be able to make art more frequently and still be able to pay the bills and eat food. (Yeah, pesky bills and food: the artist\u0027s nemeses).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first heard about the Patreon concept I was not only intrigued, but excited! It was my chance to create art without worrying so much about selling each piece. I feel more free to experiment without that pressure. Experimentation is the key to growing as an artist I feel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also love that Patreon affords me the ability to give art away. The concept of making art that makes others smile and gifting it to my patrons . . . it\u0027s a dream come true!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to all my future patrons. I appreciate you all more than you know, and hopefully you will be able to hold my art in your hands and call it yours in exchange for small monthly donations to my cause.\u00a0"

I have a family who depends on my income, but I really want to teach my children that you can support yourself doing whatever it is you\u0027re passionate about - which in my case is art!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently support myself by doing graphic design jobs, designing and building websites, photography and editing/publishing a magazine, but I am a painter at heart and have been all my life. I picked up art supplies after giving up being an artist to be a \"grown-up\" who goes to a job everyday, and I have been experimenting. I really just want to do what I love and that is PAINT! (With a little writing and photography on the side).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the thing though: I don\u0027t want to sell my work! I want to give it to people who love it, (virtually for FREE). I figure that Patreon could help me do that! If I can reach my support goals I can host giveaways and each and every one of you could own a piece of art by donating just dollars per month to my campaign.\u00a0",
