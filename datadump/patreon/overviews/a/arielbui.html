    "summary": "Hi! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ariel Bui and I am a musical artist, educator and community radio personality based out of Nashville, TN. \u00a0It is my calling to create, record \u0026amp; perform work as a musical artist while also contributing to society through arts \u0026amp; activism. All of this requires time, energy, financing, and community support. If you choose to join my community of supporters as a patron, you will gain access to exclusive content designed JUST for YOU!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll four of my albums to date have been made with the help of my DIY community. Thus far, they have been largely self-funded and put together with the help of friends, family, and volunteers. My most ambitious project, the self-titled album, was produced by Grammy-nominated producer, Andrija Tokic (Hurray for the Riff Raff, Alabama Shakes) and recorded with a \"boss crop of locals\" (Stephen Trageser, Nashville Scene). Recording, mixing, mastering and pressing the limited edition, all-analog records cost me roughly $10-12k. \u00a0This amount cannot factor in all the favors from friends that moving forward I would like to be able to pay fully and fairly.\u00a0This long list of friends who\u0027ve helped includes singers, musicians, photographers, videographers, stylists, artists, screen-printers, graphic designers, publicists, and so many more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBen Swank of Third Man Records recently chose to include my self-titled album in Nashville Public Library\u0027s local music collection, Boombox, not only for its musical value but for its many collaborations within the Nashville arts community. The album was premiered by American Songwriter and rated 4 out of 5 stars, featured in She Shreds Magazine and other magazine and radio outlets worldwide.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the political and economic climate continues to change, with the rise of Kickstarter-funded artistic projects and GoFundMe-funded medical bills, it is clear to me that we can divest from corporations and invest in what is important to us. Whether that is by supporting our local farmers through a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) subscription, supporting small local businesses and non-profits like WXNA, or supporting artists who are women and women of color like myself, we can put our time and money where are hearts are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your interest in my art and artistic process, for building community, and for supporting me as an artist. \u00a0If you invest in me, I will commit to staying connected with you on my life as an artist, whether it\u0027s by sharing my newest blog, song, cover, or idea. I\u0027ll share with you all the behind-the-scenes work that shows you that an artist is always at work, not just when they are recording an album. Whether it\u0027s gear \u0026amp; maintenance, recording, manufacturing, distribution, paying a band and a team, or simply the time it takes to write, create, perform, and administer music and art, every penny you invest will go directly towards making the world a better and more inclusive place through music and the arts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eAriel Bui\u003cbr\u003e"

I am on the search for a good electric/acoustic guitar that is built for my size and frame. A smaller guitar will also alleviate feedback issues when I fingerpick at live shows. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal amount is based on the price of the Breedlove and Taylor models that fit the criteria. But if there is a great acoustic guitar below the goal, any remaining money would go directly to other guitar-related gear like pedals (tuning pedal, tremolo pedal, etc) and maintenance.",
