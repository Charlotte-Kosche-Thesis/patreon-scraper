    "summary": "Wow, \"Who am I and what am I doing here\"..... That\u0027s a lot to cover in a few paragraphs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReader\u0027s Digest Version\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI guess when we strip it all down to the bare roots, I\u0027m just a human, who, disenchanted with chasing the American Dream and what society holds dear, has decided to follow her gut instead.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been told by a ridiculous number of people that I should write a book or blog series about my life (as it\u0027s been somewhat unconventional, NOT because I\u0027m a fabulous writer)\u00a0so this page is a means for sharing both the current journey I\u0027m on as well as some of the others that have brought me to this place in life. \u00a0Some things you\u0027ll find inside:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdventure stories\u003c/strong\u003e - I have a bit of a wanderlust and travel a bit. \u00a0I love sailing so crew on different boats and each trip is.....well, a trip! In the past 5 months I\u0027ve cruised the west coast of Florida, island hopped around Puerto Rico and done a Honolulu-to-Seattle delivery crossing 2700 miles of the North Pacific. Each boat, captain and crew, origin and destination have a different vibe and it\u0027s own multilayered tale. I plan to sail roughly 50% of year so there\u0027ll be lots of interesting stories/video if you\u0027re into that sort of thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRandom Thoughts\u003c/strong\u003e - Whether more \u0027formally\u0027 written blog entries or simply my stream of consciousness journal, this is simply me sharing my soul with whatever happens to be on my mind. Often has to do with whatever I\u0027m currently processing for \"soul evolution\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHistory\u003c/strong\u003e - Some would say I\u0027ve lived several different lifetimes in this one life... stories of sex, violence, abuse, mental illness, addiction, financial devastation, fucked up relationships, supernatural experiences, acceptance, healing, joy, peace, authenticity, purpose. \u00a0Many of you will see yourselves reflected in various shades here; some will find reasons for hope and encouragement, others will find reasons to judge. Some of it will be graphic. A lot of it will scare the fuck out of me to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInterests\u003c/strong\u003e - I\u0027ll share my yoga, weight training, astrology, numerology, crystals, cards, reiki and other energy based practices. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour participation here and patronage helps to support things like cameras, cell phone, laptop and other techie stuff; location or activity specific gear; and also provides liquidity to take on some of the more interesting adventure options out there. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd look \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u00a0Over there \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u00a0In that right hand column \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u00a0That first level of patronage is only about the same as a latte (ahem, or a Happy Hour glass of wine, much preferred!) a month. C\u0027mon now, this is thirsty work!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSlightly Lengthier Version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent the first 40 years of life in various levels of unconsciousness - allowing first my family system, then my peer group, then my relationships, concurrent with the \u0027programming\u0027 by society to define who I was and what was supposed to make me happy. I spent a lot of time (and money, misery, frustration and failure) trying to conform, to live up to and within those parameters. I only had rare moments of joy, peace or contentment even though I spent many years\u00a0devoted almost entirely to \"getting it right\" via various therapies, medications, religions and self-help books. \u00a0Those modalities did plant some seeds for finding happiness and gave me some tools to better function in the world, but none brought me the peace and happiness that I was looking for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people are happiest when they feel \u003cem\u003esettled down, secure in routine and habit, well ensconced in a community, have shared history with, be recognized by, always part of\u00a0the group.  \u003c/em\u003eWell, that\u0027s not me at my core.  I thought it was for the longest time, since its what all those influences were telling me was the \"right\" thing to be fulfilled by. \u00a0I did crave and chase situations that are supposed to create those feelings. But every time I was able to manipulate and control situations into looking like that idyllic picture, they never provided those feelings for long - \u00a0if at all! I was chasing what was supposed to be fulfilling but instead, I found deepening levels of pain and internal discord. \u00a0Finally 2 of the 3 biggest genres of stress - occupation/finances, relationship to others (marriages, familial) and relationship to self (health, identity crisis) went off the reservation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe second half of 2014 was like hitting a HUGE reset button. \u00a0My life as I knew it fell apart - the business of my dreams that I\u0027d poured heart, soul, ridiculous amounts of time and stress along with every spare cent into AND the marriage that I had put an equal amount of effort and sacrifice into BOTH imploded in truly spectacular fashion within 4 months of each other. \u00a0No human being can fuck things up as dramatically as all that.... There was simply no other answer than to realize that \u003cstrong\u003eGUS\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cstrong\u003eG\u003c/strong\u003eod, \u003cstrong\u003eU\u003c/strong\u003eniverse, \u003cstrong\u003eS\u003c/strong\u003epirit... Cosmic Consciousness, Allah, Wakan Tanka, Brahman, Flying Spaghetti Monster - whatever you want to call it is fine by me)\u00a0had been trying to get my attention for a damn long while and THIS was what it took for me to snap out of my shit. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I did. I realized that even when those supposedly-happiness-inducing situations were going well there was always this underlying feeling of claustrophobia, of my hem being tugged at and being urged to pull away, of not quite belonging underneath all appearances, of faking it.  All as if to say, \"This isn\u0027t where you\u0027re supposed to be spending your time and energy. Your purpose is over there\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\".  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSurrender is the most painfully liberating process that I\u0027ve ever undertaken. I wish I\u0027d done it 3 decades ago. I\u0027m still in process of waking up, of unraveling the energetic chains and lifting the spiritual veils and I guess that is what this page is really about - a look at the practice of not just LISTENING TO but ACTING ON my Soul\u0027s promptings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat has really called to me for as long as I can remember are exploration, travel, adventure.  I sought it in books, in relationships, in different jobs but always as a side effect rather than an intention. \u00a0Rewriting my life script to actually fit my Soul rather than trying to cram my Soul into some proscribed plan is big shit.\u00a0I\u0027ve had the typical voices in my head for denying my Soul. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow can that even work?\u003cbr\u003eW\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ehat are you going to do for work, for money? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhere will you live?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho would ever pay for something like that?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat about all your stuff?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut it\u0027s not the conventional, proscribed life path!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eCan you even trust someone like that?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat will people think of you? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt costs too much. It\u0027s gotta!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eWon\u0027t you be lonely? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou can\u0027t make any money doing that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eHow can you keep a man if you\u0027re traveling? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s too dangerous, think of all the bad people out there! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cem\u003eWhat if you try and fail?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eDon\u0027t you want a normal life? \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou\u0027re just running away from responsibility.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eFreeloader. \u003cbr\u003eAnd just w\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003ehat do you have to show for yourself?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSociety requires acceptable answers to these questions, goddammit!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYeeaahh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFuck that noise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, did I mention I have an occasional potty mouth?  #SorryNotSorry\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, 2015-16 were two years of aggressive self-directed growth, healing, emotionally and energetically purging 41 years of life. \u00a0This allowed a seed planted by a platonic friend to find fertile ground; the invite to spend 3 months island hopping in the Caribbean as I learned to sail, and if that went well, then a 3 year global circumnavigation - all without any tit-for-tat, quid-pro-quo romantic expectations and for a financial investment no greater than the cost of my food. Just two cool, symbiotic humans exploring the world. Talk about the offer of a lifetime! How cool (yet scary) is that?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScary how? In a practical sense, it looked like taking sabbatical from teaching yoga,\u00a0trying to learn to swim (whatever kind of swimmer I now may be after those 6 weeks of lessons, I was not a swimmer AT ALL before this), ending my apartment lease, selling my car, selling/donating all of my worldly possessions save what fits loosely in a 5\u0027x5\u0027 storage unit, leaving my darling kitty cats in the hands of a dear friend (\"Mak Cat Daddy\" \u00a0Kris, forever grateful for his friendship) and jetting off to Florida to pursue my soul\u0027s lifelong call for adventure with just a gym duffle and 2 35L drybags. How many grown ass adults \u003cem\u003edo that?\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the energetic sense, it was another layer of deep soul purging... Something as simple as stepping into a pool of water for that first swimming lesson triggered intensely primal, reptilian-brain deep, core-of-my-very-being bolts of fear, anxiety, trauma pain and sensory memory. \u00a0It was a flashing movie of early childhood sexual abuse playing on my mental IMAX as well as the subsequent scenes of its effect rippled through my life. Each step along this journey has held similar points of growth and ultimately brought me here to this moment....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA big fat Fuck You to those self-negating, self-doubting programs in my head and a big fat Fuck Yeah to living authentically, from Soul, and trusting GUS to make shit happen. Not that that\u0027s an easy thing.... Simple, perhaps, but not easy. \u00a0Ironic. Something that superficially seems\u00a0like fluffy good time was actually the Universe challenging me to dive into a deeper realization of living on Soul Terms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo speaking of living..... I now live in Ft. Lauderdale, FL or Scottsdale, AZ (because one place has better access to sailing and my kitties are still in the other) and the rest of the time I\u0027m sailing or otherwise adventuring.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhat happened once I got to Florida is where the story gets interesting....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut you\u0027re going to have to become a Patreon to find out more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
