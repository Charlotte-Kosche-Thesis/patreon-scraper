    "summary": "Greetings! My name is Franz. I\u0027m a Twitch broadcaster and creator of YouTube content focused primarily on video games but also encompassing travel, culture, cuisine, tea, history, melee weapons and firearms. I derive great joy from both the production process and the subsequent discourse with my viewers, but my increasingly strained financial situation has gradually brought my heretofore unprofitable YouTube endeavors into conflict with my paying job, which now struggles to meet basic expenses due to rising living costs and lack of opportunities for raise or promotion. Your support, even at the most modest level, allows me to spend fewer overtime hours earning an entry-level salary and devote more time, energy and resources to doing what I truly enjoy: producing videos of the highest possible quality about the various topics of interest to me. My content will never, under any circumstances, be hidden behind paywalls or early access - it is and always will be unconditionally available to everyone, patron or not. While I regret that I\u0027m unable to offer tangible rewards for higher levels of contribution, I am also not a proponent of that system to begin with - I value all of my supporters equally regardless of whether you\u0027re willing or able to pay, and I detest the idea of segregating you into different classes of privilege based on arbitrary requirements that may be outside your means to fulfill. If anything, it works the other way around: your patronage on any level is a reward for my efforts, and an incentive for me to continually strive for personal and professional improvement. All that I have to offer, I offer with no obligations and at no cost.\u00a0Thank you sincerely for your consideration."

Reaching this goal and anything beyond it will allow me to expedite the repayment of my debts and free myself from the bonds of my existing financial obligations, at which point the sky\u0027s the limit! There are so many things I want to experience, so many places I\u0027d like to see, so many videos I\u0027ve always wished I could afford to produce... all of that will be within my reach at this threshold. YouTube will be my full-time job at this point, which... well, to be quite honest, would make me very happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA special note regarding this goal: a longtime dream of mine has been to move to Japan and pursue formal studies of the language. In addition to providing untold opportunities for new YouTube content, living in Japan and developing my proficiency at Japanese would position me to provide a far greater depth of insight into the world of video games, which is and always will be one of the main draws of my channel. If it is feasible for me to pursue this dream without compromising the quality or the nature of my YouTube content, my ultimate priority upon attaining this milestone will be to do so. Please be aware that should I move to Japan, I\u0027ll be unable to continue making firearms videos as Japanese law strictly forbids civilian gun ownership.",
