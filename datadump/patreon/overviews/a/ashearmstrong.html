If you\u0027re here, you might\u0027ve read one of my books and enjoyed it enough you wanted to look at other ways of supporting me. Or maybe you found me randomly and my work seems interesting enough to consider reading and supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write genre fiction. Horror, fantasy, sci-fi, and all the permutations and mishmashes thereof. If you\u0027re unfamiliar with my Grimluk series, I like to call it sixguns \u0026amp; sorcery. There\u0027s western elements in the use of Wild West era technology and tropes. Horror elements in the form of demons and monsters. And, of course, a whole lot of fantasy elements. Grimluk is a big ol\u0027 orc with a big ol\u0027 gun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore recently, I\u0027ve decided to branch out into game design. After getting deep into Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons, I took to homebrew. I\u0027ve also developed a strong desire to make a video game. I currently have some homebrew items up on \u003ca href=\"http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?x=0\u0026amp;y=0\u0026amp;author=Ashe%20Armstrong\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDM\u0027s Guild\u003c/a\u003e. And while I\u0027ve always enjoyed cooking, I\u0027m hoping to explore the culinary world more thoroughly as a giant with diabetes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWell, if you\u0027re familiar with the site, then that\u0027s fairly obvious. I create and I\u0027d like to make money doing it and I\u0027d very much like to find more ways to make that money as a creator. I do everything myself as a self-publishing author. I\u0027ve had three successful crowdfunding campaigns. I\u0027ve hired out for art and editing. I do all my own formatting. I run my website. I do my own advertising. I like it but it\u0027s hard to earn enough in the arts, especially given some of my needs. I\u0027m diabetic, have sleep apnea, and deal with various amounts of chronic pain due to old injuries and joint issues. All combined, it means I have a restricted diet and monthly prescription costs to keep myself functional. I\u0027m doing my best.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO YOU GET?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003eWith just $1 a month, you can get exclusive news and snippets from my current works-in-progress, with the occasional short story, essays about any number of topics, game design chronicles, and blogs about cooking and the recipes I use. For game design in particular, I\u0027ll be doing D\u0026amp;D homebrew, though I may branch out eventually, and I\u0027ll also be starting a Metroidvania (emphasis on the Castlevania part) project at some point, so you\u0027ll get to go on that journey with me. Cooking will only be once a month and reliant on grocery money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, for $25, I\u0027d be happy to take a request for a short story each month, and I will occasionally have non-requested stories as well. All requested stories will have a max of 2000 words (time/energy management on my part). If your request isn\u0027t a concept, and you just want a story with a protagonist named after you, I can do that, as well, though in that case, I may add your name into another story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what you\u0027ll get. That\u0027s what I\u0027ll get. Hopefully everyone enjoys themselves. Whatever your choice, thank you for your time.\u003cbr\u003e"
