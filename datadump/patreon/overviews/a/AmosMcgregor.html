    "summary": "HI! My name is Amos McGregor and I love recording music. I own a small recording studio, carved out of a 1930\u0027s gas station, and I record everything from rock to pop to country. I live in a vibrant, artistic community outside of Asheville NC, in the middle of the Blue Ridge Mountains.... an area with a rich musical history and in my off time I get to listen to local songsters, pickers, story tellers and balladeers.... This rich musical history is woven into the soil of these mountains. It is, however, a dying voice. These old Appalachian musicians are woefully under documented and my goal is for the studio to be solvent enough for me to take time to search out and record these fine musicians.... folks that would gladly play on your porch for 6 hours and a jar of moonshine but would never think of paying to come in and \"sing into the can\". Your patronage will allow me to pursue these musicians, invite them to record and get their music out to a wider audience... before it\u0027s gone for good.... But it\u0027s not just Appalachian music! Imagine a creative space where anyone can come and create music without the burden of paying a ton of money and worrying about how to pay for it.... \u00a0I\u0027m sure it would spark creativity. By supporting me you would be supporting these musicians, some that would otherwise never be heard, and enriching not only their lives, my life but your own... through monthly gifts of music recorded here in the Jewell of the Blue Ridge Mountains....
