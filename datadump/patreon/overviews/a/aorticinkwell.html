I\u0027ve been drawing pretty much my entire life and now I feel I\u0027m at that point I should be doing something meaningful with it and sharing with all of you.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I HERE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to improve upon my skills while providing my patrons with a story I\u0027ve been developing for years that\u0027s deeply personal to me. My hope is to concentrate more on my art so I don\u0027t have to take on as many hours at work to keep myself afloat. If I were able to focus on my art full time without having to take on another job, that would mean the world to me so I can devote everything I\u0027ve got to developing and promoting my work. At this time, I can\u0027t do it alone so that is why I set up this page. With your help, I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll be able to make it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eART PROCESS\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI typically use ink and watercolor as my main mediums in most of my works. Other tools I work with are Prismacolor markers and colored pencils, Copic markers, acrylic paint and pastel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m hoping to accomplish with my comic is a level of detail that I usually save for my more intricate illustrations (some of which can be seen on my Instagram: @aorticinkwell). I would love to put out a fully rendered comic in which any page could stand alone as a work of art worthy of wall space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSTORY\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is titled \"Morgaleya\". In the first part that I\u0027d like to share with you, it will revolve around a moth-man named \"Raoown\". Raoown is an enslaved prince whose remaining tribe members are held captive by the tyrant \"Roan\" and his team of faithful henchmen. As the story progresses, he will encounter a being of the forest unlike any he has ever seen before, the warrior Rodendra. What he is able to learn from her may help him put an end to Roan and save what remains of his people while meeting strangers that will change the course of his life, for better or worse, it is uncertain.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s just one part of a larger story I\u0027ve always wanted to put on paper (and someday) into a book! I\u0027m currently planning on releasing it as a webcomic before collecting it into volumes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMorgaleya is a story that is intended for teens and adults as I was inspired by comics like \"The Savage Sword of Conan\" growing up. It will have LBGTQ themes and explore other issues that are deeply personal to me such as mental illness. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOU GET IN RETURN\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only will you receive my undying love and gratitude but, depending on the tier, you will get:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to Patreon exclusive posts where I will share art from the comic and various illustrations/sketches before I make them public.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eColoring pages\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e8.5\"x11\" prints.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePersonalized mini-sketches.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAs progress continues on the comic, chapters will be collected into PDFs and shared with patrons.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSketch requests.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eYouTube steams.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to the Lens feature!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs milestones are reached, I will be more than happy to add to the incentives!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI do hope that I can have your support in order to accomplish what I\u0027ve only been able to dream about!
