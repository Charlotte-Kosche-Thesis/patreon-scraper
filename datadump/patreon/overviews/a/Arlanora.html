    "summary": "Hello there, I\u0027d be pleased to introduce you to my game, Arlanora; A game that has already been green lit by Steam and has a following of people who are hoping to get this game produced.\u003cbr\u003eSteam Greenlight page: \u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=635394168\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me tell you more about the game...\u003cbr\u003eThe USP of Arlanora is that it\u0027s a fun party platformer (just like the old days of sitting around your mate\u0027s together playing co-op and trying to show off.) but each character can be developed just like most single player RPGs. Arlanora is a hack and slash RPG that you can play locally with friends or with a team of AI (or even both if you don\u0027t have enough friends.) All the battles in the game have strategic vibes because you can give AI party members specific roles they can do in a fight on the fly, be it attack, defend or follow. Each of these paradigms cause the AI to use different abilities, move towards strategic points and overall change the party member\u0027s behaviour all as if you\u0027re playing an RTS but you\u0027re still down in the nitty-gritty, cutting people up with swords, tarot cards or guns and mashing buttons for the party member you have focused.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
