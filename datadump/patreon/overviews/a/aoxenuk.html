What I will offer through this patreon however is my own personal knowledge and experience to those interested.

However, I still make posts on the actual patreon page in case you do not feel like using discord. If you wish to become a mentee and aren\u0027t interested in using discord, while I\u0027d love you to participate in our little community I am open to see google hangouts or skype as potential alternatives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for caring and thank you for pledging, \u003cbr\u003eI love you\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2665\u2660\u2663\u2666\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
