    "summary": "Hello Patreon community. This site is to help allow me to continue to make great videos and arcade hacks. I love hacking arcade/video games as well as fixing them and I enjoy helping other people learn how to do the same. Unfortunately it takes a TON of time to develop and especially document the work I do in a fashion that helps others learn, and while I love doing it; the \"opportunity cost of making a video or documenting a hack/fix is quite expensive\". So this is my attempt to give me an excuse to spend the time making videos and hacks for everyone. It would be great if I could make enough re-occurring money every month to allow me to devote some number of hours each month to ensure I have something new to create and share."
