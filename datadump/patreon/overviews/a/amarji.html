In 2016, I became a U.S. citizen and, for the first time in my life, I voted as part of a free and fair electoral process, the controversy concerning Russian dabbling notwithstanding. As we enter 2017, I plan to do all that I can in order to protect our democratic system, having experienced what its absence can do.

I\u2019ve been doing it on and off for\nmore than fifteen years now, and this has not gone unnoticed in the Washingtonian policy circles where my blog posts and reports are closely monitored.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy blogging style has always leveraged my personal\nexperiences as a the sole offspring of one of Syria\u2019s better known artistic\nfamily, as someone who had a brief brush with radical Islam when I was in my early\ntwenties before getting exposed to the writings of America\u2019s Founding Fathers\nand transforming myself into one of Syria\u2019s known prodemocracy and human rights\nactivist, and as a person who enjoys combining irreverent satire with serious\npolicy analysis.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt this stage, what I hope to do is keep updating my blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.thedailydigestofglobaldelerium.com/\"\u003eThe Daily Digest\nof Global Delirium\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0The blog represents a rather ambitious undertaking and features different sections dedicated to policy analysis and commentary (domestic and foreign), satire \u00a0and, in a way,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://delirianmundi.thedailydigestofglobaldelerium.com/\"\u003ephilosophy\u003c/a\u003e.

Quirkiness galore. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI treat every blog post as standalone work of art almost, one that draws on each of the sections mentioned above to make a point or to elaborate on certain running themes. I also continue to modify and add sections.

Yet, and for all the time that has elapsed, and all the\nprogress made, the gods and men seem more angry than they have ever been\nbefore, driven by primordial longings that remain unfulfilled and seemingly\nunfulfillable. We have now moved into the thick of a new century, the first in\na new millennium in our haphazard existence, and the venomous rancor of the\nmost powerful of our gods and men is threatening to plunge the world into a new\nera of darkness and delirium, as unnecessary and unfathomable as such\ndevelopment has always been. These are the chronicles of these mad and\nmaddening times, recorded as they unfold for the benefit of a posterity that\nmay not come to be, yet should it do so may need to understand from whence it\ndid and how it managed to survive in the face of all odds, mayhap its children\nwould learn from the mistakes that are now being made.\u201d\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eBut, and as I explain in the \u003ca href=\"http://about.thedailydigestofglobaldelerium.com/p/the-daily-digest-of-global-delirium.html\"\u003eabout\nsection\u003c/a\u003e, it\u2019s not my intention \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px; text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003e\u201cto celebrate the\nmacabre or engage in a continuous litany of grievances; rather, the hope here\nis to show and defend what is deemed to be ethical and to highlight the\nnecessity of more objective and properly contextualized understanding of the\nworld around us.\u201d\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eSerious blogging, however, is more than just a full-time job and\nrequires more than following the news. \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA serious blogger has to do plenty of\nresearch in order to delve behind the headlines.

Funds will be used to defray costs such as transport and travel (following news and developments is not just about watching a screen but requires attending events and workshops near and far) and promotional activities (Facebook, Twitter, Google), as well as enable me to dedicate myself full-time to the endeavor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShould\nmonthly pledges exceed $5,000/month by an appreciable margin, then, I would be able to invite guest authors to\nadd more flavor and insight. Naturally, I will invite authors whose background and\nexpertise will enable them to tackle issues from angles and perspectives to which many\nAmericans are rarely exposed, but should be.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor now, however, we need to keep the focus on reaching our primary goal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy enabling people to make monthly pledges of as little as $2,\nthe Patreon Community offers a unique opportunity for launching and sustaining creative\nendeavors of the type described here over the long-haul without putting undue burden on any one person or organization. This\nis why I feel that the goal set here is indeed attainable. \u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
