I conceived this project in the summer of 2009 and my earliest notes date as far back as 2008. For many years, I developed, revised, and expanded the world of the Mythology until it grew into something that I could no longer comprehend without an index. The multiple, converging story lines became so complex and expansive that I lost track of names, places, eye colors, and defining traits. It took on a life of its own, and I want to share that life with the rest of the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe principle story follows a young, capricious farm girl named B\u00e1bi Freyr who embarks upon an epic, ever evolving journey toward a visceral deliverance for her frustrated adventurous whim.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Babi Mythology is not typical of its fantasy contemporaries in its emotional and psychological depth. It is an existential rumination on the human soul, the morally ambiguous and symbiotic nature of good and evil and the moral gray area in which we all operate in some extant capacity. Many of the themes highlight the contradictory nature of heroism and the consequences that arise from its undertaking. It is a genre bending series that explores fantasy adventure, drama, romance, mystery, psychological horror, graphic eroticism, and nebulous science fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA secondary mission of this campaign is to ensure the time necessary to cultivate and empower creative expressions. I would like to grow as a writer through consistent content creation and find the financial security to focus on just that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are currently \u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003etwelve\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0planned \u00a0entries in the main series, though this could be reduced due to longer manuscripts (\u003cem\u003ee.g. 1000+ pages\u003c/em\u003e). There are also several short stories planned to fill in the gaps between multiple converging story lines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(89, 89, 89);\"\u003eUnfortunately, I don\u0027t have the luxury of affording the kind of time necessary to complete this project at a reasonable pace. As such, I will be attempting to release a minimum of \u003cu\u003e1\u003c/u\u003e chapter a month. With enough patronage, I will be able to accept less days at work, and dedicate more of my time and effort to this project. The ultimate goal is to attain enough patronage to complete the series or become independent enough to pour all of my energy into writing.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease take a look at the first chapter of \u003cstrong\u003eThe Babi Mythology\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0linked above.

Obviously, I cannot afford very much of this kind of tinkering, so the availability has been strictly limited to a total of 15.
