     "about": "Brief history- grew up in SF, went to Lick-Wilmerding high school (lick what?), got a BS in environmental sciences at UCD, went into the Peace Corps, came home and got trained as a computer technician, worked in a bank...and then in 1999 went to Burning Man... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joined a fire troupe and began producing performances and events, for which I began creating art. That led to being hired as decorator for festivals and events, installing my artwork internationally. An epiphany on the beach in 2004 revealed what was possible to create when the canvas is vast. And I was ready to step into the literal daylight and be in the meditative space of the beach while creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to be outside and to create in beautiful locations. I am in constant fascination with patterns, particularly the ones found in nature. The artwork is so many things to me- technical puzzle, conceptual journey, meditative walk, opportunity to be outside barefoot at the beach(!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt feels as though I am on the cusp of a new stage in my artistic expression. I feel a culmination is arriving after years of unknowing gestation. Its an exciting time. If you receive anything from what I do I am thankful and feel blessed.",
