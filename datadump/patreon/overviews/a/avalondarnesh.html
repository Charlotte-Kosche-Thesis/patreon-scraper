     "about": "Hey, I\u0027m Avalon. I\u0027m a Feminine Visionary, Shamanic Midwife and Temple Keeper, working with awakening mothers on the cutting edge of evolution to align with your heart, womb and inner wisdom, and birth your magic into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also unschooling 5 kids in a blended family, with 2 coming and going, while running a business and birthing my dream life in the process... there are layers.... it\u0027s not always linear ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get real here... mums have had a pretty hard time... we\u0027re stretched, exhausted, overwhelmed, depleted and stressed trying to do everything in this culture of isolation, while neglecting ourselves in the process. In society, we\u0027re pretty much the bottom of the ladder when it comes to finances and influence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt actually needs to be the opposite, sister! Our voices need to be heard! We are here to nurture and tend life, to contribute to the flourishing of the planet!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWE are at the cutting edge of evolution, birthing a new way as we raise the next generation! We are being called to rise into inner alignment as the \u0027queen of our hive\u0027, and this high vibration of harmony influences all in our realm...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHIS is how we change the world. Starting in our own hearts, homes and communities... this needs to happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, my mission is to help you remember the truth of who you are as a radiant, \ndivine woman, here to walk your path in love, truth and freedom. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in the way of this? Let\u0027s go there sister... we are shifting generations of old stuff and releasing limitations as we step into more beauty and magic in our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a background in Shamanic Midwifery, Counseling and Wholistic Psychology, I\u0027m a writer, speaker and mentor, exploring intimate topics like intimacy, birth, sex, relationships, motherhood, women\u0027s mysteries, transformation and rites of passage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, when I\u0027m not talking with guides in the shamanic realms, I\u0027m also super practical, and a total DIY tech geek, with my hands on all the tech tools and systems that support me to share my message and serve my tribe. \nPartly, this learning curve has been out of necessity because I haven\u0027t been in a financial position to \noutsource these things so I\u0027ve been bootstrapping - part time working while homeschooling 5 kids is a\n factor in this!! - PLUS I love being empowered and knowing how things work so I can be autonomous and manage my own stuff and do things better... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m honoured to be the Divine Mother Temple Keeper, which is a virtual space for mothers to deepen into all the aspects of divine mother - including dark mother, earth mother, erotic mother, cosmic mother and savvy mother... to activate our womb wisdom, blood mysteries and collective multidimensional visionary powers to birth our magic into the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this page I\u0027ll walk you through what I\u0027m actually doing behind the scenes, in my home, with my business, in my family... basically whatever arises. There will be actual screen-share tech tutorials where I\u0027ll walk you through step by step processes I\u0027m actually doing... and share personal videos for you to watch... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo... want to peel back the curtains and see what it takes behind the scenes? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s do this! I\u0027d love you to join me.\u003cbr\u003e",
