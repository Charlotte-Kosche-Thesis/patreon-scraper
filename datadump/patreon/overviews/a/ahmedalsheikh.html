You may have seen my reviews and articles on Marooner\u0027s Rock. I\u0027ve been at this indie writing thing for quite a few years now, and I\u0027ve managed to do some really impressive things. I\u0027ve published a small collection of my short stories from college as the Kindle exclusive book \u003cem\u003eWandering Djinn\u003c/em\u003e, and followed that up with my first novel, \u003cem\u003eLunen: Triblood\u003c/em\u003e. You can get a copy of it\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ein paperback, digital, and audio formats from most\nmajor retailers like Amazon, iTunes, and Audible.  It\u0027s been nominated for the Writer\u0027s Digest Self-Published award, and the Global E-book Award in Sci-Fi/Fantasy.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eLunen: Triblood\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0even got a favorable quote from Kirkus Reviews. (Trust me, getting one good quote from a Kirkus Review is an achievement for most indie authors)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThree reasons:\u003cbr\u003e1. Income. Let\u0027s be honest, I\u0027d love to dedicate more time to writing, and be able to pay my bills with money from my writing. It\u0027s natural to do what you love for a living.\u003cbr\u003e2. Connecting with readers. I want to talk with you people, let you know what I\u0027m up to, and give you all guaranteed first chances at copies of my books for being supportive.\u003cbr\u003e3. Get funding for future books. I\u0027m not just going to write novel-length stories. I want to create stories that anyone can pick up. Physical books, digital versions, audiobooks and adaptions into other media. All these things require stuff like editors, artists, interior layout design, printing services and distributors, as well as marketing. And all that requires funding, especially as I prefer to put out a quality product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy monthly? And why no higher priced pledges?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWriting a full-length novel takes time. Even if the story is completely written there\nneeds to be\u00a0even more time to produce it as a professional-level book in multiple formats. The monthly choice allows me to dedicate more time to writing, as well as save some of it towards the production costs. As for why the pledges cap at $15, I am dedicated to giving you good value for my work, especially as I produce physical books. As such, the pledges chosen allow me to work at my craft while being affordable to you. It\u0027s a win-win!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eReady to become a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eGreat! This is your first step into my world, not only for my stories and adventures, but to look behind the scenes at what it takes to be an indie author. It should be an interesting journey for us all. And last, but certainly never least: thank you for your support\u003cbr\u003e"
