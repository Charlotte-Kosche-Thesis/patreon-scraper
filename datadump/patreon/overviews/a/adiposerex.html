    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThere is adult content involved\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy title is Adipose Rex. For several years I have been posting stories on \u003ca href=\"http://adipose-rex.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003edeviantArt \u003c/a\u003eand have amassed a fairly solid following from expansion story enthusiasts. I don\u0027t think anyone likes every type of story I do, but plenty like any given one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a while I have been offering commissions, and the experiment has been satisfying if not entirely successful. I have had problems filling requests in a timely manner, and the number of offers I\u0027ve received have been low. Fair enough, I say. Artists are more popular than writers, and it\u0027s no doubt easier and perhaps cheaper to request a static image than an entire story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I figure/hope there are people who would like to support my work even if they don\u0027t have money to spare to request a complete story. Thus, Patreon. I\u0027ve been supporting various creators for a couple years now, most with just a dollar or two a month, and I\u0027ve been very satisfied as a customer. I don\u0027t think it is too much to assume there are others out there who feel the same, and would be\u00a0willing to kick\u00a0a buck or two my way as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if enough people contribute just a bit, it will add up to an amount significant enough to alleviate some of my constant enough financial problems, reducing stress and leaving me in a better frame of mind to produce more expansion-based content. Not that I expect to get rich off of this, thus I won\u0027t be offering tiered rewards or milestones (except the one), but \u003cstrong\u003eany and all support is appreciated.\u003c/strong\u003e Even if I only make five dollars a month off of this, it will be something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo! What do I actually create/plan to create here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write expansion stories, as I said, but a more specific breakdown would look like this:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Weight gain, first and foremost. Mostly women, but I do male weight gain as well.\u003cbr\u003e-Vore would probably be second. I only do female predators, and I only do oral/soft vore. That is, the women swallow their prey whole; no mastication, no male preds. Oh, and my predators tend to gain weight as a result of their voring. Not many hyper-metabolisms here.\u003cbr\u003e-Pregnancy is one of my oldest fetishes, but I do not do as much involving it as I do the above two.\u003cbr\u003e-Female muscle growth is a very distant fourth. I\u0027ve only written a handful of stories involving FMG, but it is an appealing genre.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I have done breast expansion, ass expansion and blueberry inflation. Of those three, ass expansion would be my favorite, and in the future I plan to do more booty growth but non-weight gain stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy plans for the Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, I don\u0027t have enough faith in myself to set in stone any deadlines or weekly schedule. So I will not promise anything along the lines of \u0027Five stories a month\u0027 or \u0027A pregnancy story in week one, a weight gain story in week two, etc.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try to produce content on a regular basis, and to incentivize that I have set this Patreon so that donations are \u003cstrong\u003eper upload\u003c/strong\u003e, rather than per month. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can -\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eand I strongly encourage you - to set a maximum amount each month that fits your budget\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories may tend to the long side now and then, but one thing I hope to do with this Patreon is produce more quick-and-easy expansion only stories. No character drama, just a set up and then some growth. I also hope to do more chaptered stories, instead of starting something and then losing steam and letting the story sit unfinished for six months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA couple questions I expect to receive\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Can Patrons get special deals on commissions (price, place on my to-do list)?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo. At least, not at the moment. This is a new endeavor for me, and I want to keep it simple for now. If this is a success and I get a certain (undetermined) number of Patrons, I might offer special commissions to people who pledge a certain amount. If I make any such changes, I will inform all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Can Patrons make requests/suggestions for very short expansion-only stories?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes, but at a time of my choosing. As I said above, I need to get a handle on this first before I do anything special, but I might (sooner rather than later) offer 1,500 or 2,000 word pieces based on suggestions. Something I can do in a morning or evening in one go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor any other questions, you can send me a note here or on dA. For a sampling of my work, check my dA gallery. It\u0027s divided up according to genre for your convenience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
