    "summary": "Hi! Thank you for taking interest in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alyaa Gad, I\u0027m an Egyptian medical doctor who hopes to make a difference in raising health awareness for her people, as well as all Arabic and English speaking communities around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was a medical student 20 years ago, I came to the conclusion that the overwhelming majority of the patients I saw in the hospital in Cairo were sick because they were deprived of access to health information. Imagine a woman losing her child because she didn\u0027t eat the right foods while pregnant, or a child losing his leg because he had an infected wound that was not cleaned properly, or a diabetic man who died because he hit his foot and didn\u0027t know what to do next, or an epileptic child who was being beaten to death to exorcise the evil spirits out of him! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe danger can also reach us overseas, when for example we buy products that contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria, or when we receive newcomers who need to integrate in the new societies and their health status will have an influence on ours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.20min.ch/dyim/0de4b5/M600,1000/images/content/1/7/9/17954526/9/topelement.jpg\" style=\"width: 731px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter graduating, I decided to go educate my people by traveling to the deprived villages, but that was not enough. I went to TV stations, but they didn\u0027t find the idea commercial enough! When YouTube came along, it was my dream coming true! I started making health education videos addressing disease prevention, sexual health, fitness, first aid, and child care.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfham.TV / iUnderstand.TV is an educational platform and YouTube channel for public and sexual health, targeting predominantly native Arab communities in the Middle East as well as refugee and migrant communities in Europe and USA. It is an Arabic-English bilingual site that has produced more than 350 health education videos since 2013. Please check out our website for more information and YouTube channel of \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AlyaaGad\"\u003eDr. Alyaa Gad\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince our launching, we have been doing very well with more than 230,000 subscribers and around 45 million views, and the feedback has been always positive, but we do not earn any money to keep the project going. The videos we produce are of highest production quality with the help of our professional team. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.iunderstand.tv/wp-content/uploads/hypertension-705x397.jpg\" style=\"width: 549px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project has excellent potential and a humanitarian cause. We have been receiving \u003ca href=\"http://www.iunderstand.tv/press/\"\u003emedia attention\u003c/a\u003e from all over the world, especially nowadays with the urgent need to inform and integrate the refugees into their new home communities in Europe and the US, with a faster and broader scope than ever before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now running the show from a media start-up company in Zurich, Switzerland where I work together with a Swiss producer and his team, who help me make super-quality videos with their care and expertise. But we are totally depending on our personal finances to keep it going, and we wish to keep it alive as long as possible with your help. Your support is more than some cash, it\u0027s empowerment and health for the people who badly need it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much.\u003cbr\u003eAlyaa Gad, MD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
