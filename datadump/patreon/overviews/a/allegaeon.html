    "summary": "What\u0027s up everyone! Thank you all so much for going out of your way to check out our Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eTHE SITUATION\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you may or may not know, being in a touring band can be very, very expensive and many bands that make it to the touring level of their careers don\u0027t last very long after that. Between the costs of travel and maintenance on our touring vehicle alone, much of the money that is made on tour is immediately spent on staying afloat from day to day and this leaves the band little to nothing in the bank after the tour is done. This is a huge problem for us as people who have to eject ourselves from real life responsibilities (aka. rent, bills, food) for sometimes months at a time so that we can take our music on the road and bring it to you in a live setting. While we love doing so, the financial repercussions are very real and very pertinent to the survival of bands today.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eTHE STATE OF THE INDUSTRY\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe really do love what we do and want nothing more than to continue to do so for as long as we are able. The harsh reality of, not only our situation but, the current state of the metal industry is that fans do not have very many ways to directly support the bands that they love. While we appreciate beyond words the support that all of you have given Allegaeon over the years, much of that money goes to the industry figureheads that provide the platform for us to internationally market and distribute our music. Without them so much music would go unheard, and their role is an extremely pivotal one in allowing the world to hear our music. However, the costs of fulfilling their role are very high and do not leave much left over for the musicians involved to support ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eWHAT DO WE DO BETWEEN TOURS\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor years and years now, we have all done our best to make money however we can between tours. Brandon is a farmer, Greg is a music teacher, and Corey, Mikey, \u0026amp; Riley all jump between part-time jobs for sometimes only weeks at a time while we wait for tours to start. As you might imagine, this process is very stressful and not knowing whether or not we\u0027ll have our jobs when we come back from tour is a constant fear among all of us. Even if we do manage to keep the job we had before tour started, none of us are in a position to commit the necessary time to further ourselves in those workplaces to the point of earning an average salary while we are at home. None of us are homeowners, all of us have roommates, and none of us even come close to making the average yearly U.S. income of $51,939.00.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eTHE GOAL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eSo here it is. We want to make Allegaeon the center of our little musical universes, and to do that we need for it to be our full-time job. Just like any other full-time job, whether it be working at a gas station, at a tech-company, or as that one factory worker who dips the ends of dildos into paint to make them look super real (you da real MVPs), we need to see some sort of compensation for our work. Ultimately, our goal is to meet the \u003cu\u003eaverage U.S income\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0of $51,939/yr. for each member, which totals to $21,637/mo. With 105k+ followers on Facebook alone, if a mere 4.77% of that audience donated a meager $5.00/mo. to Allegaeon, we would exceed that goal by about $3,405 per month, giving us more than enough left over to throw right back at you in the form of exclusive content, face-to-face hangouts, and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eREWARDS\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best way that we can show how much we appreciate your contribution to our success as a band and as individuals is for us to give back to you directly. Our rewards program stacks as the subscription fees go up, much like many other crowd-funding platforms, so that your subscription works for you as much as it does for us.
