If you\u0027re here because you\u0027ve checked out our stuff...big ups from us! \u00a0Seriously serious thanks to you from Kyle and Ryan, even if you don\u0027t contribute. We can\u0027t articulate how good it feels to send our voice out into the void and get a thumbs up. Without that positive feedback, we would have quit a while ago. We\u0027re going to keep going and see where this takes us, and anything you can spare will help us do that whether it\u0027s equipment, media, production costs, or just the psychological incentive that comes with knowing what you create is worth at least a dollar. And if YOU\u0027RE somebody that thinks our stuff is worth at least a dollar, then you have our deepest thanks. Like deeper than the previous thanks. Like you found the hidden lever in the basement of the old mansion to reveal the secret lab underneath where irresponsible scientists are meddling with the laws of science and nature to create unfathomable, mutant super-thanks. You have our mutant super-thanks."
