Thank you for visiting my page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create unique fire and fusion dance\u00a0 performances. I have a passion for choreography, and truly enjoy playing with the different visual effects that can be created through live dance. I play with a variety of fire tools, including fire fans, balancing bowl, palm torches, fire\nstaff, double staffs, and spinning wands. A wide array of dance styles and techniques have influenced the way I look at dance, and because of this, my choreography tends to be distinctive and versatile. I love many different kinds of music, from folk to classical, from oldies to hip hop, and this multiplicity influences my style as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Vision\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do something different. The way I utilize these unique tools is different from the norm, and I hope to share the beauty that is locked inside it\u0027s potential. In addition, I fuse the art of dance with the art of tool manipulation in my choreography. This allows amazing opportunity for intense and engaging storytelling. All art, whether it be dancing, painting, acting, or anything else, is about making people feel. That\u0027s what I am driven to achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a very unique platform that allows you to help support the artists you love. It\u0027s kind of like Kickstarter, except that rather than raising a large sum of money for one project, you can \u0027tip\u0027 artists for the content they create. Patreon is also\u00a0 super flexible! You can always change or cancel your pledge amount at any time \nwith no fees. You can also set a cap to the amount that can be paid out to make sure you don\u0027t go over budget. There is no obligation to stay a patron for any length of time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eContent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere on Patreon, I plan on posting unique choreographies with a variety of styles and tool use, including both solo and group performances. I plan on 1-2 unique performance videos per month, depending on feedback from you. As a patron of any amount, you\u0027ll gain access to my\u00a0 activity feed which will include behind the scenes photos and videos, messages about upcoming projects and shows, and lots more. \u003cbr\u003eThis also lets us converse back and forth so that I can get your feedback and ideas for future projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027d like to extend to my patrons a variety of bonus videos as a thank you for your support. With a pledge of $3, you\u0027ll get access to monthly fire tool and dance tutorials, with a focus on \nstrength, flexibility, and muscle control. This will include technique with fire\n fans, balancing bowl, spinning wands, fire staff, and double staff, \netc. At $5, I will create a one-time unique performance dedicated completely to YOU! I\u0027ll contact you personally to find out your personal tastes in music and style, and collaborate with you during the creative process. If you pledge $10, you\u0027ll receive a one on one interactive online class. You can ask questions, get feed back on technique, and so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd This Guy\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check out my brother \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/johnnycase\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJohnny\u0027s Patreon Page\u003c/a\u003e as well.

     "about": "Fascinated by dance at an early age, I took classes that ranged from gymnastics and ballet, to tai chi and kung fu. In my teen years, I began study in classic ballroom dance, focusing particularly on swing and salsa. Encouragement from friends helped me discover a talent for belly dance, and a love of tribal fusion. At twenty, I witnessed my first fire show. Within months, my fingers were blistered from practice with fire fans and my life changed forever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with other members of my talented friends and family, we co-founded the troupe Pyrate Technics, an enchanting band of fire-spinning rogues and gypsies. We have performed at dozens of venues since 2009, premiering at esteemed events such as the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, Blood Moon Regale, Redding Fire Festival, and All\u2019s Faire. Our troupe is devoted to fire-safety, and promotes the NAFAA safety guidelines. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I continue my study of dance and am dedicated to the\nenrichment of art. I frequently take belly dance and yoga classes, and I\n have expanded my study to modern and hip hop dance. Choreography is one of my most fervent passions, and with Pyrate Technics I have had the opportunity to experiment and practice several experimental techniques, including technical tool manipulations and dance moves between partners. I have some skill at costume and jewelry design, and hope to pursue this further as time goes on.",
