I currently live in Germany with my husband and enjoy being creative on a daily basis. I \nalso write 2 blogs about mental health and healing from trauma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my coaching blog here: \u003ca href=\"http://www.couragecoaching.wordpress.com\"\u003ewww.couragecoaching.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI currently still live with the effects of trauma from my own childhood (particularly narcissistic abuse) and because of this I have \ngreat insight into the struggles that come as a result of this type of \ntrauma. I also grew up as the youngest sibling of a special needs brother, so I have also experienced the struggles associated with special needs in a family. I have a creative background with a Bachelors in Jewellery Design and I ran my own business for 5 years.This wasn\u0027t my life\u0027s ambition however, so I continued being creative for my own mental wellbeing and found that my biggest fullfilment comes from supporting others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough I live with the symptoms of Complex Post Traumatic Stress daily, I want to reach as many people as possible to educate and validate their journeys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI qualified as a cognitive behavioural life coach in early 2016 and then started creating Youtube videos with content that is helping people who have also suffered with childhood or relationship trauma.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goals:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I have set up this patreon page, is to improve the creation of my youtube videos and \nhopefully create a series of e-books, which will include the information I talk about in my videos plus a lot of additional resources.\u003cbr\u003eIn order to better serve my viewers \u0026amp; followers of both my videos and my blog, I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResearching, filming and editing one video can take up to 8 hours or longer, so any funding for all the time I put into them would be greatly appreciated.The e-books I want to create are for people who need step by step help in how to deal with a narcissistic parent or partner and I am hoping that this platform will also enable me to do this. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron to my page, you will not only be supporting the growth of my youtube channel and improvement of the services I provide, but you will also support the recovery journey of so many others as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not least, I also aim to create content that validates and supports siblings of \nthose with special needs. Unfortunately, through my own experience, I \nknow how much of a struggle it is to cope with a special needs brother/sister and through research, I have discovered that there really aren\u0027t that many resources out there for this rather large community of siblings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMental illness affects all of us at some point in our lives. We unfortunately live in a society where people aren\u0027t willing to listen to those who are quietly suffering. Stigma can seriously affect the recovery process of many people with invisible illnesses, so raising awareness is crucial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for stopping by\u003cbr\u003eLove Athina xox\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
