Over my whole life as a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.sensitiveleadership.com/letter\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egenetically highly sensitive person\u003c/a\u003e and more than 10 years that\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aneaxford.com/this-is-me/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eI have been working with highly sensitive clients as a teacher, coach, therapist, and facilitator\u003c/a\u003e, I have learned a lot about how to strengthen sensitivity. It\u0027s an inside job that is highly affected by the outside, and how those two connect. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I am focused on not only strengthening those who are highly sensitive individually, but changing things at the cultural level. I would like to produce more videos, write more books and blog posts, and facilitate more projects that are based on collaboration with other highly sensitive people strengthening sensitivity through media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://aneaxford.com/work/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can see some of the things I\u0027ve already created here.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSensitivity is pretty misunderstood, generally speaking.\u003c/strong\u003e It has taken me a while to figure out how to talk about it, and then depending on who I am talking to I have to change how I talk about it because of the dominant cultural perspective and different perspectives therein. Many people associate it with weakness and they want to fix it. But, being affected and being vulnerable are part of being human. So fixing sensitivity is not a sustainable strategy. For those who have been following my work for a time, I can speak more in depth. For those who are brand new to concepts of sensitivity, there is a certain kind of caution that is important. An initiation into the break-down that is about to happen.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes people think I am being mysterious with how cautious I am, but I am really trying to be respectful of a process that I think is very important. Most of us are not that cautious with our sensitivity until we learn how to be. We expose ourselves to all kinds of things and we may not really understand the effects of what\u0027s not working until we are very sick. We live in a culture that assumes independence and the ability to do whatever you want, given the right resources. We expect to fix problems. But parameters, power, privilege are all real. Context and culture are real. This body of ours and this planet of ours is real, and they are different from what we think they are or what we think they should be. They are their own. They are sensitive. They will never not be sensitive. They need to be sensitive, and within that sensitivity there are more refined needs. I teach about these needs. I teach about how to meet them, that they are real and that they need to be met. They cannot be fixed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my work, I do like to educate newbies. I like to educate anyone and everyone. Understanding sensitivity is super important to me personally and culturally. I think that issues of \"sensitivism\" are at the heart of much of what hurts us globally and personally. We punish ourselves and others for being sensitive, we prey upon the most vulnerable. I think that much of sexism, racism, poverty, illness, and so many issues of power are very practical and very related to this oft unseen X factor of sensitivity that so many just don\u0027t understand. There\u0027s a lot I don\u0027t talk about outside of my work because if people don\u0027t want to hear it, then they won\u0027t. There are certain things I say to someone who wants to hear it, depending on where they are in their own process with their own sensitivity so that I am meeting them where they are. I don\u0027t want to overwhelm them. Sometimes I do anyway even if I don\u0027t mean to. This makes it hard for me to know how to talk on social media or in public forums. And with the way that many of those public online spaces operate, it just doesn\u0027t facilitate the kinds of conversations I want to have.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO, I am coming to Patreon. Even though I like to educate, I also like to connect and go deeper into the cutting edge with those whom I can collaborate with to actual create new experiences and culture with. Facebook used to be a great way for me to connect with people, but now it has become difficult to use for me in the way I work and the kind of conversations I like to have. It requires me to promote and pay for my posts in order for them to even be seen because of how crowded it\u0027s gotten. I\u0027ve been making resources for sensitivity for a long time. I provide most of them for free. I believe strongly in only charging money for the things that I show up for personally with you personally or that simply have outside costs, like the cost to maintain a website or extra service. I believe in enough, and in having enough. I believe in knowledge and the power of giving it to people as generously as possible. The internet gives us so much access to knowledge. And now, with Patreon, I get a built out service that allows me to offer more for you who want more at a price that I believe suits everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get to pick what you pay. You get a monthly subscription to what I am offering in a place where I can be more focused in the discussion. I will still be offering what I create to everyone who wants it, but you will be supporting it directly and also have access to talk to me about it directly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp until now, I pay my bills with 1-1 sessions. Those sessions take time that only exists between the client and I, and I have learned so much in them. But now I really feel called to work in a different way. Many people who follow my work have asked where my book is, my blog, and for more resources. These are resources I would love to give with the time to create them. So I need to work in a more flexible way that allows me to create those things, for you and for all. Much of what I have created has cost me money, and I didn\u0027t make it with the intent to get rich or famous. I have done live shows, recorded interviews, video trainings and education, all for free to the public and at a cost to me that I\u0027m willing to pay so that I can have more of the world I want to live in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would love your support now for each of the posts that I share freely. Videos, live recorded shows, interviews, writing, and more. A small contribution from you can make a big difference toward me being able to make more of those things to share and educate publicly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy intent with all I create is to change the way we use sensitivity because I want to live in a world that honors this part of me that is essential to who I am and essential to health on the planet. I have gotten to meet so many wonderful people, witness so much beauty, and develop my own culture of strong sensitivity through this work. I have a life now that is so empowered through my sensitivity and those I connect with. I feel so grateful to have this life and had no idea when I started publicly doing my work that this would be possible. But, I still feel a disconnect. I still find that so many people who come to my work want to fix their sensitivity. They seem to interpret my life as evidence that they can \"overcome\" it, but that is not what I have done at all. It is hard for me to offer so much and to still be missed. I like the parts of myself that many people hate, and I like those parts in other people too. I want to be able to have more connection that is based on liking our sensitivity and working with it. I hate the experience of liking something about someone more than they do and then losing in the process because they hate that I like them for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am now beginning a PhD in Human and Social Services with a specialization in Higher Education so that I can develop out my work into a curriculum to study and to teach professionals going into human and social services. Many professionals are not taught about this trait at all. So I see that a huge area of changing the way we use sensitivity is in changing the way our providers understand it and work with it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also becoming a mother. Having a son will surely be a hugely educational experience of practicing all the things I have learned about and taught related to Sensitive Leadership. I have the opportunity to parent a human being in a way that intentionally strengthens and honors his sensitivity, not just help him reparent himself. I believe that reparenting is an important process, and the work I do with Sensitive Beast retreats and practices is essential, one that we can all come to experience as individuals no matter where we have come from. BUT, trauma is real. Culture is real. And I have the role of being a leader with not only myself now to rebirth who I am, but with another human life that is in my charge until he can be his own leader of his own life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now want to focus more on writing and producing, I cannot do this without the income I have had from 1-1 sessions. I want to be able to go deeper and wider with this work. Will you join me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I like about Patreon is the immediacy and flexibility. Those are two things that I have found to be so important to working with sensitivity, and creating in the way I want to create. We can connect immediately, I can share with you immediately, and we can adapt as we go. This is an experiment. There\u0027s no right way to do it. If there are 10 people who use it and benefit from it, we all learn. If there are 100 people, same deal. If there are more than that, exact same deal. It creates a medium in which we can all commit to show up as we are, and right away. And it\u0027s enough, whatever you can offer is enough. If you decide it\u0027s not benefitting you, you can cancel. If you decide you want more, you can get more. If you have a suggestion, you can tell me. We can all do what works, not just what we think should work, but what actually works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re new to what I do and trying to figure out how or where you fit with what may be resonating with you, here\u0027s a video I made to help you understand where to start and what to do now based on where you are now with your sensitivity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, this, is not about Sensitive Leadership though. This is about me, Ane. This is about me talking with you, being a part of a community and offering you what I make. This is about my writing, my words, my presence, my feedback, my attention, my focus. Sensitive Leadership has all those things, but it is based more on what IT is. It\u0027s a platform and a model for connection that is it\u0027s own product. I try not to dilute that process and model with other aspects of my self. I am me, I am the creator of that product. I have a lot to offer if you want to engage me and what I make/say/think/feel on a daily or monthly basis. This is about if you want to work WITH ME and support me in creating more public content that I can post on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aneaxford.com/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e, in book stores, in person,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/sensitive-leadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eaudio\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/sensitiveleadership\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evideo\u003c/a\u003e, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are also welcome to become a patron and pay whatever monthly amount you would like simply to support me and my work, even if you don\u0027t feel called to participate in any of the rewards. Every little bit supports more. I see my role as an advocate for all of us. And I know that isn\u0027t everyone\u0027s role.
