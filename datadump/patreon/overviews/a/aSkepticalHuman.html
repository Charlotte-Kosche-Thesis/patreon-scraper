    "summary": "My YouTube channel is dedicated to refuting flawed arguments and false claims as convincingly and thoroughly as I can. My goal is to make people more rational and informed, whether they agree with me or disagree with me at the outset. (I also provide text and audio versions of my content on my website, allowing people to pick their poison.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe topics that I choose to focus on in my videos\u2014the topics that I assume you are interested in and passionate about\u2014are often deemed unfit for monetization on YouTube. Whether it\u0027s politics, religion vs. atheism, or science vs. pseudoscience, many of my videos get quickly demonetized, meaning I don\u0027t make \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0money from these videos\u2014regardless of how much time and effort I put into them. And this is unfortunate, because if you ask me, these are some of the most important subjects that there are to discuss. That\u0027s why I make the videos that I do, and I assume that\u0027s why you watch my content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m asking all of you to consider becoming a supporter on Patreon at whatever level you can, whether it\u0027s just one dollar per video or more. With your financial support, not only will I be freed up from the vicissitudes of demonetization, but I\u0027ll be able to spend more time producing the best-quality content that I can on a wide variety of subjects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny and all support is truly appreciated. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, everybody!\u003cbr\u003e\u2014A Skeptical Human (Anton Dybal)\u003cbr\u003e"
