    "summary": "Writing books and creating worlds for them is absolutely the most fun thing I can think of. And while I definitely appreciate \"Literature\", I also believe really firmly that fiction should be entertaining, and that with all the sad and dark things going on in the world, fiction should remind us that humans can be awesome. Sadly, I have this little thing called a life, which involves a full-time job teaching, two small kids, and a couple of small businesses, so making time to write can be a challenge.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand, I can drop everything at the last minute and spend two nights up past midnight on a cake if someone decides they want to pay me to do one. SO I figured I could try applying that same logic to writing: if enough people are willing to pay me to do it*, it\u0027s easier to prioritise. It means I can get books out faster, which would be AWESOME, because at my current rate of 2 books per year, I\u0027m going to die long before I can get even my currently-planned series executed. (Oops. Was that a bad pun? O:) ) It also means I can splurge for high-quality covers and editing, which are pretty cool things to have, AND it provides an awesome way for me to get cool bonuses to the people who want them most - fans just like you! :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re here, thinking about joining this awesome lil community of mine... Wow. THANK YOU. Like, a lot. You are genuinely an amazing human being \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Whoa people are paying me to write? This is... you guys, this is WEIRD. o.O\u003cbr\u003e"
