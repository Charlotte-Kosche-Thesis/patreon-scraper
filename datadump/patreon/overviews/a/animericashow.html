    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo who the butt are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn 2012, two idiots decided they could make videos on the internet. Sadly, they never stopped to ask if they should. However, two years later, I was joined by a new idiot, JT Kamp, and since then, we\u0027ve been making anime review videos better than we thought we ever could. Through our stupidity and sarcasm, we bring laughs, joy and anime to people\u0027s lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright, well, what do you need my money for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eUnlike a lot of \u0027review\u0027 series, Animerica has higher ambitions than just pumping out videos. We want to tell stories and also put out the best possible content. Believe it or not, this comes at a fairly high cost. We\u0027ll never stop making our videos, but the more money we have available will increase the quality of the product, no question. Season Three of Animerica has cost us nearly $25,000 and is our biggest project to date, but we wouldn\u0027t be able to pull something of this size and scope off again without your help! Believe us, if we were rich, we\u0027d spend a lot more money than that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay... let\u0027s say I give you some cash or whatever. Can I get whatever I want?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe love involvement and input from our fans and we\u0027ve got a lot of ways for everyone to get in on the action and influence our product, but for reasons of ego and wisdom, we have to draw the line somewhere. That said, you can donate a dollar a month to see our videos a day ahead of time, or you can indulge that power trip and drop two-fifty a month and force us to do your bidding. It all depends on how crazy you feel today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWow, you guys sound amazing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThanks, Will. You know just how to make my day.\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "If you ever go back and watch our very first review for Animerica, you\u0027ll probably be extremely underwhelmed. Well, we feel the same way. That\u0027s why what we\u0027d love to do is go back and do a brand-spanking-new edition with our freshly honed comedic abilities and a whole bunch of petty cash at our disposal. If you want it, demand it. Otherwise, that\u0027s okay. We still love you!\u003cbr\u003e",

Honestly, it\u0027s hard to believe we\u0027ll get this far, but if we do, we\u0027ll go nuts. $2000 a month means a new camera, new quieter lights, a new mic rig, and new soundproofing to make everything that much more awesome. I mean, I don\u0027t know if we love ourselves this much, but if all of you do, go for it!",
