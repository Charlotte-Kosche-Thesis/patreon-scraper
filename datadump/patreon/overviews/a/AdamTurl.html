    "summary": "My work exists in a narrative conceptual framework -- paintings, sculptures and installations built around stories of working-class life (often borrowing from speculative fiction, magical realism and the total installation traditions of Russian and Eastern European conceptual artists); a sort of speculative art poetics. Some of my current projects include:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.evictedart.com/the-barista-who-could-see-the-future/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Barista Who Could See the Future\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e (about a working-class artist who believes he gets visions of the future), \u003cem\u003eErasure vs. Flint\u003c/em\u003e (about two brothers -- one who collects and restores images, and another who constantly erases them),\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Healing Properties of Post-Industrial Debris\u003c/em\u003e (in which rust-belt artifacts are commodified by the pharmaceutical industry) and \u003cem\u003eThe Revolt of the Swivel Chairs. \u003c/em\u003eI have upcoming exhibitions at the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.thecubelv.com/\"\u003eCube Gallery\u003c/a\u003e in Las Vegas and \u003cem\u003eThe Barista Who Disappeared \u003c/em\u003eat\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.carbondalearts.org/galleries-a-public-art/304\"\u003eArtspace 304\u003c/a\u003e in Carbondale, Illinois.

Surprisingly few rich art patrons want to support work critical of capitalism. I have set up this Patreon page to seek additional support to help underwrite the ongoing production of our work. I want to thank all my collectors and supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBiography:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://evictedart.com\"\u003eAdam Turl\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.evictedart.com/#\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eis an artist and writer based in St. Louis, Missouri.
