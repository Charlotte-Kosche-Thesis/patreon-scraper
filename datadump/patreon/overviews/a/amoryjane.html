    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Amory Jane. I\u0027m a sex educator, podcast host, and sex-positive entertainer. It\u0027s a rad career! I love that this is my path and know I\u0027m a lucky human that this is what I get to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople often think the life of a sex educator is glamorous or sexy all the time (constant orgasms, partying with porn stars, hotel orgies, etc.) I am here to tell you that while I happily admit my life can be super sexy (and, yes, the orgasms are pretty constant but I\u0027ve only been to a couple of hotel parties), the truth is that my life is rarely glamorous. Sex education and producing shows = lots of hard work and long unpaid hours. I\u0027ve also been #blessed with the Chronic Trifecta\u2122: Chronic Pain, Chronic Depression, and Chronic Poverty. This Trifecta makes it hard to keep my business running sometimes, but  I\u2019ve still managed to do some neat things. For example: \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eI\u0027ve taught 62 workshops in the past year on sex, consent, and/or healthy relationships.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLast year I did a poor sex educator version of \"Eat, Pray, Love\" after my divorce. I left my job managing a sex toy boutique, bought a used 1987 Toyota mini RV, named it St. Edna the Sex Ed Mobile, then went all over the Midwest and South teaching sex education.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn October 2016, I created the podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amoryjane.com/sex-on-the-brain-podcast/\"\u003eSex on the Brain with Amory Jane\u003c/a\u003e. It has had 15 episodes with thousands of downloads and has covered topics like pegging, sex \u0026amp; depression, and intersectional polyamory.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIn December 2016, I presented the live stage show \u003ca href=\"http://whoopee.live/\"\u003eWhoopee! A Sex-Positive Variety Show\u003c/a\u003e to a sold out audience. Whoopee! is now a popular monthly show that regularly sells out and just moved to a bigger venue in June!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027m proud of my journey and accomplishments, but it turns out helping people have better sex and relationships and having people like what you produce is not always the same as getting paid well or being monetarily rewarded. The reality is that being a sex educator means it can be challenging to stay afloat and continue doing important work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo, I set up this Patreon as a way to get more support for things I already do that people love and appreciate --sex education, sharing vulnerability through writing/creativity, offering advice on sex, dating and play parties, and giving an inside look at my ridiculous (sexy, adventurous, heartbreaking, comical, real) life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis will be an exclusive community where fans and friends can get to know me and my various projects behind the scenes. I will share sex ed and road trip videos, advice, never before heard audio from my podcast, backstage photos/videos from my variety show (along with playlists of songs featured during the show), my new adventures of stepping into the world of standup, very raw and personal writing, and late night cannabis-fueled posts that may range from comical observations, to deep cultural or self-analysis, to photos that are too hot for Instagram. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJoining my Patreon community means I get to keep doing work that is important and rewarding and betters society, and you get entertainment, education, connection, and to live vicariously through someone who has the life of a traveling sex educator. Each bit of money pledged will go towards me being able to continue my work in the field of pleasure-positive, anti-oppressive, and consent-focused sex education. Thank you! I hope you enjoy, and please always let me know what else you want to see from me. This is my new project, and I am committed to giving you what you want so I can give the world what it needs. \u003cbr\u003e"
