    "summary": "Hello. My name is Luke Malpass and I was born in the UK. I am a self-taught person in almost every aspect of what I do and I have a very curious and determined mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked for people, for companies as well as created multiple businesses in the UK and abroad and still do. Through the course of my life so far I have learned many things, and it turns out I\u0027m pretty good at most stuff from software development to hardware design, soldering, car mechanics, CAD, business, online retail and more. I have made businesses out of all of them, but the reason I did all of those things, the reason I learned them in the first place and made businesses was the pure desire for knowledge. People crave a new TV, a new laptop, a new pair of designer trousers or a car... I crave to find something I don\u0027t understand and to learn it, figure out exactly how it works, and then find a simple, easy to understand way to explain that to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest pleasure comes from firstly understanding something fully and being able to master it, and secondly from then giving away that knowledge and seeing others understand and benefit from it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating free YouTube videos since the start of 2017 and I have had nothing but great feedback about my teaching skills. It has opened my eyes to the rewards of giving something away for free and I want to keep doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBusiness in general is stressful, draining and not in any way fun. I would much prefer to earn enough money to pay my bills and to give away all what I have learned in my career for free. This could be the start of allowing me to do that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will likely always have businesses as each business is also partly about learning new things, giving people jobs and that is also rewarding, but ultimately I would like to make teaching my business as I love every minute of it.\u003cbr\u003e"
