From now on, each new plugin and each port to VST/Windows will be free to the community. My full catalog with all \u0027classic versions\u0027 includes over 250 plugins.

I will be doing my development work to benefit working musicians, DJs and producers. The evolution of the music business has left these folks with no money and a host of predators trying to drain their wallets in various ways, and that\u0027s why I will be supplying sound engineering tools (the best and most reliable in the business) and asking only a dollar a month, or whatever they can afford, or nothing. Musicians get an impossibly raw deal and I can no longer justify charging them for my tools at $50 a pop. You can see below that I could still be doing that, but I have to take the side of the working musician/producer.
