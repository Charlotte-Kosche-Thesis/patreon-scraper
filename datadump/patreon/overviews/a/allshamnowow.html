They were pretty bad, but I was lucky enough to have people watching them. Around late-2014 I made the decision to put more effort - any effort, really - into my editing. I wanted to look back years later and be able to watch what I made without hating myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started slow, mostly tightening up videos by cutting out trash that didn\u0027t serve the narrative or a joke. Eventually I wanted to do more.\u00a0Honestly, it was watching \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/TheMrSark\"\u003eMr. Sark\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e edits that gave me a creative wake-up call. There was so much I could be doing to flesh out a video and make them more interesting to watch. It was the best creative and personal decision I\u0027ve made, but not a good financial one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first couple of years weren\u0027t bad but - as we all know - YouTube made drastic changes to monetization. I took a huge hit very quickly. And for a long time I was in the dark with everyone else about why it was happening and what we could do about it. Losing ad revenue with no system in place to see what videos were marked for ad-death and no way to appeal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI didn\u0027t want revert back to low-effort edits to increase my output. Instead, I focused on streaming to make up for the financial loss. At times halting video editing altogether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to change that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI held off on Patreon as an option because I didn\u0027t have something extra to offer as an incentive. I only want to make stuff that \u003cstrong\u003eI\u003c/strong\u003e want to make. For it to be natural and not an obligation. I felt that was against the idea of Patreon and decided not to make a page. But things change.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDirect support from my audience is more reliable, removing the power from YouTube\u0027s ever-changing policies and putting it in your hands. It can give me the freedom to put in the exact amount of work something needs, and open up the ability to invest in even better ways to do that work. In the end, making stuff people enjoy and that I can be proud of is my goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it stands, I won\u0027t be offering incentives. If you want to support what I do you can toss me a buck a month, or more if you\u0027d like. If you can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to, that\u0027s cool too. I appreciate everyone that watches my videos or live streams. I\u0027ve been incredibly lucky to make a living for the past six years doing things on my own terms. I cherish every day that I can entertain people without compromise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks."
