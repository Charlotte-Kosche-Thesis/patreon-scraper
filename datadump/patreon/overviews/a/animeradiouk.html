    "summary": "\u003ch3\u003eThank you for visiting the Anime Radio UK Patreon page.\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does Anime Radio UK need a Patreon page? we hear you ask.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eARUK launched back in September 2015 and while wanting to be popular with anime fans and anybody interested in Japanese music we never really imagined that we would become as popular as we have. As a result of our popularity it has meant that we have become too big for our small webcaster license that is required to keep us as the only official and licensed Japanese music radio station in the UK. Being officially licensed is very important to us as we believe it is right that content creators are paid for there work.\u003cbr\u003eBecause we are now required to upgrade to a new higher tier license (more than 4 x more expensive that our previous license) to keep broadcasting we are asking our fans and listeners if they can help us out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we ask is a small amount, anything you can afford. All the funds that we raise will only be used towards paying the license fees for the station. If we are able to raise extra these funds will be used to improve the quality of the content on the station as well as reduce the number of commercials should we have any.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/animeradio.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/chibi-011.png?w=1080\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Is Anime Radio UK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eARUK is created by me, Adam Hughes, and is an independent internet radio station that is broadcast from North Wales. I am a huge fan of Anime, Japanese music and generally anything to do with Japanese culture.\u003cbr\u003eI have always wanted to share my interest of Japanese music and had always been frustrated by the lack of Japanese music available in the west. Using some of my hard earned saving I decided to launch ARUK. Of course I have been taken a back by the amount of other people with the same interest and in a way that has been a blessing and a curse. It is amazing and very rewarding to see so many other people enjoying a appreciating Japanese music but on the other hand it can be a curse when it is time to pay the next batch of hosting and licensing fees.\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I am here. I would be eternally grateful for any financial support that fans of the station can offer. You don\u0027t have to support the station to enjoy the music that is played but any support you can offer will be appreciated and you will be a part of making ARUK even better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i0.wp.com/animeradio.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Sho-profile-sheet-e1442785643387.png?w=1080\" style=\"width: 243px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i1.wp.com/animeradio.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Tsuzumi-profile-sheet-e1442785728996.png?w=1080\" style=\"width: 243px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are Sho \u0026amp; Tsuzumi?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSho Tomita and Tsuzumi Higuchi are the ARUK mascots, they are fleshed out characters that we hope to do more with in the future. Their names are created from the names of musical instruments and influential musicians.\u003cbr\u003eFor more details about the characters check out our website:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://animeradio.uk/about/\"\u003ehttp://animeradio.uk/about/\u003c/a\u003e"
