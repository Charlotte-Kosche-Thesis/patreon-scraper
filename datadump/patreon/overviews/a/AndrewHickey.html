If you fund me, I\u00a0 will blog as regularly as I am able, and guarantee to publish at least three books a year, in both paper and ebook format, consisting wholly or partly of revised versions of my blog posts. I may also publish additional work that is not covered directly by this Patreon, though I will attempt to ensure that Patreon backers have access to that work at discounted or otherwise special rates (though this will depend on publishers being willing).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will try to ensure that those blog posts will include at least one on comics or vintage TV, one piece of fiction (complete or part of a serial), one on music, and one on politics. I am very willing to take the opinions of my Patreon backers into account when deciding on the proper balance of these and other topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e(Please note that the other two people pictured with me in my profile photo are not associated with and do not endorse this Patreon account.
