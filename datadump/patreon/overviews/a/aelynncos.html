I\u0027m Aelynn!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve been an artsy, geek from as far back as I can remember and I\u0027ve held it close as an important part of me ever since. I guess you could say this passion developed around the same time as many others my age with Sailor Moon ( that good ol\u0027 fashion DiC dub! XD ). I picked up a pencil and imitated the artstyle while my cousin supervised the creation of our OCs, and I supervised while my Mom and Grandma made my first \u0027cosplay\u0027. I\u0027ll never forget how proud I was to portray her with my natural waist length hair up in pigtails or the feeling I got when my cousin hung my pictures on her walls.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEventually, all of this evolved into my wanting to create \u003cem\u003emore\u003c/em\u003e. Bigger, better things and to share that excitement and pride with as many people as possible whether through bringing characters to life, or helping others portray them themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started making my own cosplays around 14 years old...with a lot of hot glue and imagination. A lot has changed since then ( a lot less hot glue! ) and a lot has stayed the same ( the late nights... \u0026gt;_\u0026gt; ) but I\u0027ve ventured into new materials, new methods, new challenges and never stopping creating until I\u0027ve been proud of what I achieve in the end.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started making digital designs to re-create character clothing styles and inspired styles just last year and I\u0027ve found it a great and rewarding way to assist in the cosplay community while flexing my creative muscles and offering something permanent, fun and even perfect for regular wear to subtly display your fandom!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg height=\"107\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4757/40347392352_90c476263f_o.png\" width=\"600\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThese creative ventures that I\u0027ve become so passionate about and invested in require a lot of time and a fair bit of moolah, and so here we are. I want to continue to grow, explore, overcome challenges and provide great costumes, content and products for myself, for other cosplayers and for you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI strongly believe the most important part of cosplay is sharing information and creating a community and so this Patreon will be free! Any cosplay related content that can benefit the community; resources, WIP\u0027s, tutorials, photoshoots, etc. will be eventually be available to the public ( Patrons get 60 days early access! ). However, having a Patreon will also allow me to give back to those who push me forward in my ventures through various reward tiers including early access!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg height=\"106\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4657/40347392442_33f844621e_o.png\" width=\"600\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor getting this far and showing interest, thank you. Thank you for those other creators you \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e support, as we strive to continue contributing to what is, in my opinion, one of the greatest artforms. And if you choose to support me as well, thank you from the bottom of my heart. For a creator, the encouragement from financially ( or even just verbally ) supporting us to keep on creating is beyond words and the feeling it gives is more than can be described and the best way I know how is to keep on doing what I do!"
