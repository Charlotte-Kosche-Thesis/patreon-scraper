    "summary": "I\u0027m a journalist and author in Toronto who writes about crime and courts. If you\u0027re reading this, you likely already know something about my work. Welcome and thanks for stopping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal when I started this account was to bring you inside the courtroom and give you information that wasn\u0027t available elsewhere. I wanted to bring you \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/triallive\"\u003elive trial coverage\u003c/a\u003e and more series like \u003ca href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/part-1-she-said/\"\u003ethis one on sexual assault\u003c/a\u003e. Things were going really well and it looked like there was a good chance of success, but then I was offered a job that was just too good to turn down. That meant I could no longer provide live trial coverage and that I can only work on journalism in my spare time. As a result, I am trying to work with other journalists to provide you with live tweeting of key trials and more in-depth court articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBased on what I hear from readers, I get the sense there\u0027s a demand for this type of coverage that is not being met by traditional media. A successful Patreon account would enable me and other journalists to deliver you court and crime journalism mostly through articles but also in the form of videos, audio reports and tweets. The vast majority of this work will be for patrons and paying readers only.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more patrons, the more the coverage will grow to cover the topics and stories that interest you most.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to pledge *US$2 or more per creation (which in this case means per piece of journalism) and to cap your monthly payment as low or as high as you want. If you are a true news junkie, a US$10 cap is by far the best as it will entitle you to receive EVERYTHING\u00a0 even if it goes way over five creations per month. Think of it as access to an all-you-can-eat buffet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, I should probably define what a piece of work is. It will be an article, audio report or video with substantial new information. It absolutely won\u0027t be a \"hot take\" or flimsy opinion piece. After all, it\u0027s reporting and journalism patrons are supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOctober 29 Update:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are looking for coverage of the Laura Babcock murder trial, please read\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/14954349\"\u003ethese FAQs\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*For now Patreon charges in US dollars only, but if they follow other crowd funders, they may well start accepting Canadian dollars too\u003cbr\u003e"
