Creating is one of the oldest acts we\u0027ve done as humans and proves to advance our culture and educates on how to live the human experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI compose music for all ensembles; from piano to orchestral and big band music. Specializing in jazz and classical, I use these two \"culturally different\" ideals to show the listener the many similarities between the two and how we can, as a human population, come together and realize the over abundance of similarities we share with one another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all, in advance, for supporting me! With your help, I can visit schools to educate, record music to share, and travel all around to share my music with you all, personally.\u00a0"

He enjoys bringing people of different backgrounds and social classes together to become an integral part of his music making. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSanchez lead\u0027s \"Andrew Sanchmo Sanchez and His Hip Six\", a New Orleans style jazz band that tours schools and universities to inform and educate students on the importance of our American music and where it originated. Using this ensemble, he eliminates what is \"jazz\" and what is \"classical\" to form it into, simply, music using his own original compositions with the American attitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn Outer Banks native of North Carolina, Andrew Sanchez currently resides in Greensboro where he teaches composition, piano, and trumpet privately.
