    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eArchaeology\nhas been described as the discipline that borrows from all the others. It\ncombines history, technology, and philosophy. My own area of archaeology combines\nscience, art, and craft. For years I have studied the tools and materials of\nancient metalsmiths, replicating bronze hammers, chisels, anvils, and other\ntools to understand how to use them and how well they worked. After earning an MSc\nand PhD in archaeometallurgy from the University of Sheffield in the UK, I\ncontinued to do research and experimental work replicating ancient casting\ntechnology and writing articles about the results. It\u2019s exciting work and I\noften join other artists and archaeologists at conferences and workshops, where\nwe demonstrate bronze casting and other ancient metalworking techniques, and exchange\nideas about our research. I want to be able to share this exciting research\nwith a larger audience and your support will help supply the materials needed\nto introduce others to the craft and science of archaeology.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ancienttools.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ancienttools.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/549132_4255389540352_1650285001_n-825x510.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eExperimental\narchaeology isn\u2019t re-enactment or living history, although there can be some\noverlap. Instead, experimental archaeology is based on a question that needs to\nbe explored and answered. I often work at a charcoal furnace, casting metal in\nmuch the same way people did thousands of years ago. Other times I am in a\nlaboratory analysing the metals I cast, or replicating experiments with modern\nequipment. It\u2019s important that very step be documented. Materials must be\nweighed and measured before and after the experiment, and detailed photographs\nare taken. However, all of this would be for nothing if the results aren\u2019t published.\nEvery paper I publish gives others information that they can use for their own\nresearch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://ancienttools.net/?p=148\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/FD20/production/_84200846_giovana_comp_624.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\nalso take these opportunities to teach others. I have helped to run workshops\naround the UK, and have participated in symposia and conferences there, in the\nUS, and Europe. In addition I\u2019ve worked with at-risk and disadvantaged youth,\nand groups with disabilities, introducing them to archaeology and ancient craft\ntechniques.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupporting experimental archaeology on Patreon will allow me\nto continue my work and writing. Unfortunately academic journals do not pay\nauthors or reviewers. And if authors want to make their work available through\nopen access so the public can read their articles, they have to pay a rather\nhefty fee. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair, but this is the current state of affairs. Your\ncontributions will go towards making my research available to everyone, either\nas an individual Patreon reward, or by enabling me to pay Open Access fees.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExperiments often need to be analysed using equipment that\nprovide information about chemical composition or examination of the\nmicrostructure. All of this requires advanced preparation of samples and fees\nfor either using the equipment, or paying for others to do the analyses. The\nsupport you give will enable me to have these analyses done, and enable for me\nto publish more comprehensive reports.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI often speak at conferences and seminars about the work I\ndo. Last year I was at the Archaeometallurgy in Europe conference presenting my\nresearch on the different ways in which technology can answer questions about\nhow metal tools were used in the Bronze Age. I also spoke at conferences about\ninterpreting the damage on bronze tools to tell how they had been used, and how\nmetal alloys are affected by recycling. Sometimes conferences provide\nbursaries, but usually it is up to the presenter to pay for the fees and travel\nexpenses. Your contributions will make it possible for me to present my\nresearch at conferences and to see what work other researchers in the field are\ndoing.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eExperimental archaeology isn\u2019t just for the academic. I\u2019ve\nworked with both kids and adults, introducing them to the world of the past and\nfiring up their imaginations. We work as teams, building furnaces and pumping\nhand-made bellows to heat charcoal to the point where it will melt metal, all\nthe while discussing life and work in prehistory. However, many groups or\nschools lack the funds to run a workshop. Your support will help to introduce\nothers to the world of experimental archaeology.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI also have a website and blog, \u003cem\u003eAncient Tools and Craft: Exploring Ancient Technology through\nExperimental Archaeology \u003c/em\u003e(\u003ca href=\"http://ancienttools.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://ancienttools.net/\u003c/a\u003e)\u003cem\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e where I share news and articles about\narchaeology, provide tutorials explaining how to build equipment, and have\nlinks to other websites and publications.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIn the future I hope to expand the projects to include others\nwho do experimental archaeology in other areas, such as textiles or glass. I\nhope that eventually your contributions will go to support a network of\nartisans who have the skills and knowledge to do research into a wide range of early\ncraft technology.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLEVELS\n\u0026amp; REWARDS\u003c/h2\u003e\n\nThe\nreward levels allow you to choose how to support these projects. Some are set\nup to be fun, but other rewards could be useful if you are interested in resources\nfor your own groups or classes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAre you a teacher or lecturer interested in\nexperimental archaeology? One of the lower level rewards not only gives you\ncopies of the articles I\u2019ve published, but also provides copies of PowerPoint\npresentations that I have given at conferences. These can be used as resources\nfor classes and groups interested in learning more about experimental\narchaeology and ancient metallurgy.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAre you interested in having me speak or conduct a\nworkshop at your event? I would be glad to make arrangements. I regularly\ntravel and welcome the opportunity to teach hands-on workshops with groups of\nadults or young people.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWant to fund a special project? Is there some\naspect of experimental archaeology or metalworking that you\u2019ve wanted to\nexplore, but don\u2019t have the ability or resources to do it yourself? We can\ndiscuss the possibilities of constructing an experiment, including research\ninto work that was previously done. I welcome collaborative projects and\nintroducing more people to the craft and science of archaeology.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eOnce upon a time the arts\nand sciences were supported by patrons, wealthy individuals and families who\nfunded artists and scientists to create great works, explore the universe, and\ninvent things. Patreon is stepping into the role of the patron, but rather than\nwealthy individuals, the patrons are all of us who contribute to the greater\nknowledge and share our resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nit\u2019s important that you know that your support makes it\npossible for me to continue my work, but it also enables me to teach and to\nshare my research as well. For that, I want to thank you, whether you contribute\na dollar a month, or a couple more to download articles, or even up the ante to\none of the higher reward levels, you\u2019ll know that you\u2019re part of the team that\nhelps make this possible. You\u0027re a fellow explorer in the world of the past.\u003cbr\u003e"

That comes to about one dodo every other day for me to make. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can start your own dodo collection, or have a ready\nsupply of gifts for the dodo lovers in your life. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI know that $40 per month is a bit steep, but I am also\nfiguring in the average cost of postage per month.

However, if the idea\nof lovely dodos appeals to you, but the price is more than you can afford right\nnow, you might consider going in with a friend.
