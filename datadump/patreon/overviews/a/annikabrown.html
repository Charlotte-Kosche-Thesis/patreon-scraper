I want to create more videos, which are funny and entertaining, or dark and unsettling (or both!) and which allow me to let my imagination run riot.\u00a0 I want to record more songs because my back catalogue is growing constantly and my songs are fighting over air time. I want to create art that inspires and dig as deep as I need to dig to bring a smile on your face. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am here because I love the idea of Patreon, the idea of a direct connection between you and me. The idea of you being a mix between a record company and a family. \u003cbr\u003eUnlike with social media, I feel I can be more honest and vulnerable \nwith what I share with you - because if you are here, and you are \nreceiving my patron only posts, I know you care to at least some degree.\n Enough to support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd your support is very precious to me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike it says in the video, for practical reasons, I\u0027m presently charging a set amount per month, not per thing, and I\u0027ll let you know if that should change, so you can set your budget limit accordingly. You can cancel anytime. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m extremely excited to be embarking on this adventure, and I\u0027m sure I won\u0027t sleep much because I can\u0027t wait to discover all the amazing projects ahead of me and all of you amazing people adventurous enough to join me on this journey. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
