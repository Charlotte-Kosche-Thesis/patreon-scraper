    "summary": "Hello my fearless friend! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, thanks for being a loyal listener of the\u003cstrong\u003e \u003ca href=\"http://www.fearfreechildbirth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFear Free Childbirth Podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. I truly appreciate it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purpose of this page is to allow you to make small financial contributions to help make the podcast possible so that I can continue to help parents-to-be claim their positive birth experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, you\u0027ve probably guessed it already, but I\u0027m on a bit of a mission. And my mission (because I chose to accept it) is this; to \u003cstrong\u003ebanish the fear that women feel about childbirth so that they can birth their babies fabulously and fearlessly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRight now, the main outlet for my mission efforts is the \u003ca href=\"http://www.fearfreechildbirth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFear Free Childbirth Podcast.\u003c/a\u003e But I\u0027ve also started a \u003ca href=\"https://www.change.org/p/channel-4-channel-4-portray-a-more-balanced-view-of-childbirth-through-your-programming\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epetition against the media so that they portray childbirth in a more balanced way\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027ve created a \u003ca href=\"https://headtrash.leadpages.co/fba-sign-up-page/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFREE 3-part video series to help you clear your childbirth fears\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing is, I LOVE doing the podcast! When I launched the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.fearfreechildbirth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFear Free Childbirth Podcast\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I didn\u0027t realise what a life-changer it would be. I didn\u0027t realise that something as simple as sharing information about birth so that women felt empowered to make informed choices would be so \u003cstrong\u003emagical\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e. \u003c/em\u003eAs well as sharing practical tips and techniques, I also I invite birthing experts to share their wisdom and mums to share their positive birth stories\u003cem\u003e... and it\u0027s working! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are what some listeners are telling me....\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"You are providing such a wonderful gift to mums to be.

Keep up the great work you are doing and know that it is not going unappreciated.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I really enjoyed listening to your shows! I love how comforting and empowering they are and how they help me feel like \"YES, I CAN DO THIS!!\". They are very informative and each show has something different and valuable to offer. So thank you for doing this!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I just wanted to say I think your podcasts are amazing. There are so many I have loved, but your interviews with Mark Harris and Susie Gower have been two of my favourites. I\u0027m currently in my first year of Midwifery and I\u0027ve just shared your website with my entire year at their request as they wanted to know where I was getting all these great facts from! So thank you for inspiring the next generation of midwives!\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eToday, I\u0027m preparing for season 2 of the podcast, but it\u0027s A LOT OF WORK. I currently do everything on the podcast: researching guests and trying to book them (how many emails?!), planning the show, recording, editing (NIGHTMARE task if there ever was one!) and all the behind the scenes techy publishing stuff... then there\u2019s the blog writing, image creation, social media sharing.. I could go on!! It takes FOREVER! And there are my 2 kiddies too! So I need help and support to keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters I could do with getting some pros in to do some of the things that I\u0027m just not very good at... like editing! That would enable me to spend more time focussing on researching fabulous topics and guests, and creating other ways to help parents to be prepare for a fear free birth. Oh and earning money to feed my two very hungry mouths! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support I will free up some of the time I spend behind the scenes on the podcast and put it to good use on the mission and to continue to produce a podcast that I can feel proud of and that helps mamas prepare for a fabulously fearless birth.\u003cbr\u003e"
