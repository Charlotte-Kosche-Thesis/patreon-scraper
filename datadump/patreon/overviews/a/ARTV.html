    "summary": "Hey guys, Jon here. Thanks for rolling over to my Patreon page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of you know me for creating album reviews, countdowns, rants, \u0026amp; various other music inspired videos for 8+ years on YouTube, transforming from AlbumReviewTV, to ARTV Reviews, to simply ARTV (+ Beyond ARTV) over the years as I expanded my content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has blessed me in so many ways, from connecting me to my now girlfriend (Infinity on Hannah) to helping me pay the bills and show that having a passion can truly turn into at least PART of how you make a living. Here\u0027s where I need you guys...see YouTube ad revenue is completely unstable, especially since the many waves of the adpocalypse have hit. YouTube in general doesn\u0027t take care of its creators, especially the smaller ones such as me. My videos are frequently marked as \"not advertiser friendly\", making me go through an appeal process... that means no ads play on said video while a YouTube staff member takes 24-36 hours to review it. While they always come back as approved for advertising, I lose out on revenue quite often. YouTube often is plagued with subscription box issues as well, taking long amounts of time to publish videos to subscriber feeds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m closer than ever to getting away from my day job, in fact I think it could be happening for real this summer. I need your help more than ever to be my rock when YouTube ad revenue is more like my quicksand. This will be a big step and potential risk for me, but the freedom of getting out of a toxic environment plus getting to do my passion full time will be well worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you could even pledge $1 or $2 PER MONTH, know that you\u0027d be helping my achieve my goal of doing what I love, following my passion for the music community, and doing YouTube full time as my career. Thanks for reading, and I\u0027ll be continuing to bring you as much of the best music related content that I can, on both of my channels no matter what.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJon\u003cbr\u003e"
