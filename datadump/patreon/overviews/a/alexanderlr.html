Whether you are a new comer or a continue supporter, I wish to let you all you know why I created a Patreon in the first place ! You see, as a freelance artist it can be quite difficult to find work and earn money from solely doing art. Yes, it does has its ups and downs, but when your doing this as a full time job, it can be quite stressful. Also, it can be very alarming if you don\u0027t have enough money to pay the bills or to even put food in your mouth, which adds more stress to the body. In the past, I was very thankful that my father was there to support me in what I\u0027v been doing ! But now that he\u0027s gone from this world, I\u0027m left to assist my family (my brother and mother) alone. So far, me and my brother are trying are best to pay our monthly bills while giving some cash to our mother to pay for food and other necessities. Also, I\u0027m currently in college trying my best to earn my associates degree, but due to myself constantly working on my my school work, it has been quite quite difficult for me to complete my remaining commissions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. Trouble With My Other Source Of Income:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, I do wish to point out that I do have a different source of income but it\u0027s not enough to support a family of three. You see, I have a Youtube Channel that goes by the name of \"Alexander-LR\" where I post different videos involving speedpaints, critiques, animations and funny skits. I sometimes receive a decent amount of views from my lovely audience, but the platform known as Youtube can be a living hell for any content creator, especially to those who make it a living. I\u0027m pretty sure some of you are aware of the infamous\u00a0ad apocalypse, where a majority of content creators (including myself) have lost monetization due to sponsors removing their ads due to \"extremist\" content. Due to this, many of us had our earrings dropped down to nearly 60 to 70 percent ! And if your your a user with a low amount of subscribers and low amount of views, then that kind of effect can lead your channel\u00a0spiraling down the toilet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e. Your Support:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will assure you that your support will have a significant change on me and my family\u0027s lives. With your assistance, I can still work on my freelancing while creating videos for my fans over at Youtube. By the way, with your amazing contribution you will be receiving rewards that may peek your interest. Also, I won\u0027t hold it against you if can\u0027t donate, but there\u0027s another way you can help out and that\u0027s by spreading the word online about my Patreon ! Anyways, thank you so much for reading and I hope many of you have a wonderful day/evening ! \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
