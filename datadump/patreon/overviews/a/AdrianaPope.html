    "summary": "Hi! We\u0027re Nate \u0026amp; Adriana. We\u0027re originally from Los Angeles, California but haven\u0027t been back home in a couple years. In June 2015, we both quit our jobs and decided to travel around the world. We bought a one-way ticket\nto Bangkok Thailand and have been traveling around Southeast Asia\never since. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy husband Nate and I have been traveling non-stop for almost two years now all around Southeast Asia and Europe. We are budget-minded travelers who enjoy getting off the beaten track. From secret rice paddies to lesser known temples, we spend our days exploring new sights, sounds, and tastes in exotic countries.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ll be the first to admit that I\u0027m a foodie.\u003cbr\u003eI have a passion for\neating exotic food in all of the different countries that I visit. I\nam adamant about trying out new dishes and learning about new\ningredients that I have never heard of or even knew exist. Most\nimportantly, I have a fixation with street food. I love it because\nit\u0027s cheap and tasty, and normally doesn\u0027t get the recognition it\ndeserves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m not hiking on some trail, you can often find me sitting at a cafe reading my favorite book with a cup of green tea. Five things I can\u0027t live without: tea, Hemingway, old-timey music, street food, and crafting! Five things Nate can\u0027t live without: coffee, snorkeling, drinking young coconuts on the beach, programming, and his laptop of course.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFollow us on our awesome journey as we explore the many far reaches of the globe in\nsearch of the best beaches and most exotic food.

I fell into a job at a\ncorporate investment bank while Nate played around with the idea of learning computer programming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt was the complete\nantithesis of what I had envisioned myself doing. After years of\nstomaching the misery, I decided that I needed change.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA drastic change.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNate \u0026amp; I both became obsessed\nwith watching Youtube videos and travel documentaries where our heroes\nwould subsist on a meager living produced from hard work and passion.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eNate also found himself unhappy at a 9-5 job and our nights were spent groaning about our uninteresting lives.\u00a0We knew what we wanted\nto do.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe idea of\ntraveling consumed our thoughts and we couldn\u0027t shake it off. It\npervaded my sleep and my waking thoughts.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI must have thought\nof a 1000 different ways I could afford to travel long-term. The\nexotic locales I wanted to visit drew me in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe decided that I\nwould save up enough money to leave everything behind.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of\nsquirreling away paychecks and minimizing my spending, we were finally\nable gather the \u201cgreen courage\u201d. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe sold everything we owned in our cramped Los Angeles apartment and gave away the rest. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWith only a small\nroll-top backpack, we boarded a plane to Bangkok with a one-way-ticket\nin hand.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSince that fateful\nday in July 2015, we\u0027ve been traveling the world and we couldn\u0027t be\nhappier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWh\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eat\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eshould you do next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are active on a\ndaily basis on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Google+ so make sure to follow us to see what we are up to. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWe are adamant about\nreading and answering all of our own emails as well as responding to\ncomments/questions on Youtube.
