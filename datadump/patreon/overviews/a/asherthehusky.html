    "summary": "Hey there! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe name\u0027s Asher Au, I am a music enthusiast and art scribbler. I\u0027ve been throwing videos on YouTube since 2013 when I was 15 years old. During those young years, I wasn\u0027t sure on my passion on music as my mind kept convincing myself that music isn\u0027t my thing, that I don\u0027t find my music skills better than most people. However after months of sharing music covers, I felt enlighten by the support given from my first few subscribers, I received the inspiration which led me on having an objective in life - creating music to return the inspiration around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your patronage, I will be able to improve the quality of the audio and visual aspects of my videos as I currently record only with my smartphone. Not just that, I\u0027d be able to attain my dream in hitting them drums - which is the reason why I started pen tapping. It\u0027s my way of showing people that you can\u0027t just allow yourself to accept your limits, there\u0027s got to be a way around to smash them beats without two sticks and a drum set!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to release two videos/covers per week. By becoming my patron, you are welcomed to contribute one dollar (or more) per month. You can set a monthly maximum so you don\u0027t have to worry about going over your budget, and you can cancel at any time. Check out the rewards below!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for considering becoming my patron! Whether you are able to contribute or not, I am so very thankful for your support. Aspire to inspire!\u003cbr\u003e"
