I\u0027ve appeared in two year\u0027s-best anthologies and been nominated for awards. My debut collection \u003ca href=\"http://www.ada-hoffmann.com/monsters-in-my-mind/\"\u003eMONSTERS IN MY MIND\u003c/a\u003e came out in October 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also an autistic self-advocate. I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome when I was 13. I write a lot about autism and neurodiversity in speculative fiction, including the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ada-hoffmann.com/autistic-book-party/\"\u003eAutistic Book Party\u003c/a\u003e reviews series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOffline, I study computer science in graduate school, LARP, play with cats, get entirely too involved in queer poly drama, and sing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I want your money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be finishing my PhD later this year. Even with the best education, employment is a crapshoot for disabled people like me. Many full-time jobs in my area of study are not accessible to me because my brain is not reliable on a daily basis in the way that they want, and the amount of downtime I need to be healthy is more than most people\u0027s. Other jobs are possible for me, but in ways that would risk burnout and abandonment of the creative work I love, or that would require me to move far away from the loved ones who support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not in trouble. I have a plan; there is part-time work I can do and enjoy that will just about keep me afloat. But in the long term, my writing is what I love most. One day, if I keep working at it, I want my writing to be my career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is one small part of that. Patreon is security. Even in small amounts, it\u0027s a more reliable income than individual story sales. Every little bit on Patreon keeps me that much less dependent on what other people want, and that much closer to where I want to be. And even the small amount helps me afford the little goodies that make it easier for me to do the work that you love - like books to review, for example.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I offering you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll The Things! Early access to original work. Writing prompts. Commissions. Hard-to-find, exclusive reprints. A say in choosing the books I review. And a personal touch - postcards, kitties, and more. Come on in and join the Book Party!"
