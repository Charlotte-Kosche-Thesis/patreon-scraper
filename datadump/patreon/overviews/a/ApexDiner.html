We work with artists to create comics and single images that contain such themes like soft vore, adult nudity, peril, quicksand peril and other fetishes that have yet to feature in our comics. We pride ourselves on keeping you happy and enjoy telling stories about our sexy OC\u0027s that always seem to get the short straw. But hey sometimes the hungry monster needs to win. And we are the ones always cheering that terribly beastie on.However we also pride ourselves on providing good quality artwork so we always look for the artists that can produce and drive towards higher quality artwork and offer a unique style. But now im sure some of you are curious on what the fetishes that we listed will involve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSoft vore - The act of being eaten alive and whole with no chewing, crunching or ripping. Basically we like to keep our ladies in one piece even when they make there descent. We prefer to use animals and monsters over giants and giantess creatures so please be aware of that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuicksand? - Ever watched a movie where someone seems to be swallowed up by the earth or sink into a bottomless bog. Well we like to think quicksand is natures trap. A little spanner that can be thrown into the works to add in some nice dramatic scenes and sinking action. Another peril to add to the list.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur OC\u0027s - All our original characters that are used in our artwork are over the age of 21 and are fictional characters. Any similarities are merely coincidental.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Goals\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe are a small group and we hope to grow and provide more content. So please help us. By supporting us you will help fund our projects and our growth. Its all of you that will make this possible. We hope to be able to provide even more comics a year, allow for small one page pieces, get you all involved and allow your own custom comics and hopefully one day dive into uncharted waters and fish out some more content for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTypes of content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo we offer three types of content for our supporters.\u003cbr\u003eThe first our singles... These are as the name suggests single pics which will include one or two damsels and one or two predators. These will offered to all patrons and will be released monthly. An alternative of these could be stand alone comic pages. Again will only be a single page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next are our comics. These will be 2-4 page comics featuring one or two damsels max. This will be available to anyone pledged to the elite supporter tier and above. These will be released on a monthly if not two month basis.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn finally we have the personal projects. These will be any comic over 4 pages long. These will be completed slowly over time and will be available to anyone pledged to the our patron. These will become available once we reach our 2nd goal and will progress according to patron driven poll."
