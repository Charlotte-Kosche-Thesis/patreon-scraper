    "summary": "You may know me from Youtube, or you may know me from the essays I\u0027ve scattered around the internet.  I\u0027m known for talking about the politics of veganism, about the history and politics of Asia, and for the study of languages (Pali, Cree/Ojibwe, Laotian, Khmer, lately Chinese and Japanese\u2026 it is a peculiar list of languages).  Probably 90% of the people reading this know me from recent videos about \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethings vegan\u003c/em\u003e,\u003c/strong\u003e but, in some ways, my interests in ecology, democracy, etc., are consistent \"inside of\" and \"outside of\" veganism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond veganism, the truth is that my web-presence is (more generally) \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eabout m\u003c/i\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ee\u003c/strong\u003e: it is about my research interests, my political ambitions, and even my personal life. \u00a0This Patreon \"channel\" provides a ton of original content (that you won\u0027t find on my youtube channel), and it is the only way to interact with me (directly); but it also acts as a crossroads, where you can engage in discussions with a few hundred people who share my interests in vegan activism and/or, possibly, any of the other issues I care about. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eIs it worth one dollar? \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Yes. \u00a0Don\u0027t pay more. \u00a0;-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page was originally put up in response to a short-term crisis, but, also, it was the start of an experiment in trying to create a long-term digital community of people with common interests: at the time (2016) I was moving to China, and I was uncertain as to what extent I\u0027d be able to continue uploading to youtube. \u00a0With some practice, it turned out that I \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0upload to youtube within China (albeit slowly and intermittently), but the Patreon channel remained a platform for long-format podcasts, articles and photos to be posted, and it became a place for me to engage in discussions with... well, anyone who thought that my content merited $1 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy content attracts some people who are really worth talking to: I\u0027ve always gotten fan-mail from vegans who\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003ereally wanted to make a positive difference in the world, and it would be nice to imagine that you could network with one-another through this channel.\u00a0 If you think my material is worth debating, then you\u0027ll probably benefit from joining a forum full of other people who feel the same way (i.e., the forum offers more than just a chance to talk to me).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already know from e-mails with my audience that many of you are questioning what effective activism means in your own community, and, also, many of you want to talk further about the problems and paradoxes you encounter as a vegan living in the real world (feeling estranged from your own culture, and, often, feeling estranged from your own family, in confronting the ethical and ecological contradictions that others choose to ignore).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, in 2018, I\u0027m returning to Canada (from China) and the channel will take on a new direction \u2014with new possibilities opening up for my own \"I.R.L.\" activism.\u003cbr\u003e"
