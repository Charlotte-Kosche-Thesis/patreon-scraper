    "summary": "Hello, fellow lingerie lover, and welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been obsessed with pretty lingerie for as long as I can remember, even before I was old enough to wear it and could only dream of the fancy things I\u2019d wear once I reached adulthood. As soon as I was old enough to wear a bra, Victoria\u2019s Secret became my favourite destination in the mall. In my late teens, however, I began to wonder what was out there besides Victoria\u2019s Secret, and made my foray into the world of designer lingerie. \u003cstrong\u003eIt was at this point that collecting lingerie went from being a budding interest to something of an addiction\u003c/strong\u003e. Nothing made me feel more myself than wearing exquisite lingerie. I looked at lingerie and researched new brands constantly, and almost all of my disposable income started going into buying more. While many women are into fashion in general, I didn\u2019t know many others who were specifically interested in the fashions of what we wear underneath our clothes, and felt that others might find my extreme interest in lingerie a bit odd. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLuckily, it was also around this time that I joined Instagram and discovered a community of women who were equally as passionate about lingerie as me! These women documented their lingerie collecting journeys by photographing themselves in their beloved lingerie and sharing their thoughts on these pieces on their Instagram lingerie blogs. I never felt instantly more at home in any other community than this one, where it wasn\u2019t considered abnormal for a non-wealthy woman to forego other desires so that she could spend hundreds of dollars on a single set of lingerie, regardless of whether or not she even had a romantic partner to appreciate it. In need of an outlet to share, and therefore help justify my already substantial and quickly growing collection, I decided to join their ranks and have maintained my \u003cstrong\u003eInstagram lingerie blog\u003c/strong\u003e for about two years now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDue to the very intimate nature of my content, I decided to make my account private and only\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eallow other women to follow me, with the exception of a very small handful of  men\u003c/strong\u003e. Each of these men had different qualifications for why an exception was made for him, but the common thread was that I knew that they had an appreciation for the beauty and art that is the lingerie itself, and not just the body of the half naked woman wearing it.\u003cstrong\u003e I know that an appreciation for fine lingerie in and of itself isn\u2019t exclusive to women, and lately, I\u2019ve been thinking more about how I can open up my lingerie blog to a wider audience of all genders while still protecting myself.\u003c/strong\u003e Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to weed out all of the creeps, but \u003cstrong\u003eon a  platform such as Patreon where users have to pay to see a creator\u2019s content, I feel that the audience at least values what I do enough to show their appreciation in a tangible way, and if they are willing to help fund what I do, they certainly deserve to see it.\u003c/strong\u003e And the more funding I get, the lingerie I feature will be even more spectacular, I\u2019ll be able to invest in higher quality equipment, and I\u2019ll be able to work with talented professionals, all adding up to higher quality posts for my patrons to enjoy. So the more my patrons put in, the more I\u2019ll be able to give back to them. I\u0027m very excited to connect with more lingerie lovers than ever, and hopefully embark on some new journeys in documenting my growing collection!"
