    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eINTRO\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThank you for your interest. My name is Acci Baba, a Visual Artist living and working in Berlin. I create Experimental Art Film that unveils a\n unseen point-of-view and presents a \nimage that people don\u2019t know how to react to, but make them think. My motive is to investigate another explanation on universal truth to gain further understanding of what we are and where we are heading to. This is what I like doing and what I am specialized in. I wanted to take this opportunity to financially sustain upcoming projects and hopefully being able to continue my practices to make this world a better place.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWHY CROWD-FUNDING\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eUp to now, I have been personally financing the production \ncosts on my own, sometime with an additional support through my close \nfriends. Eventually my creative ideas grew and realized it was not possible to continue financing out of my pocket. Then I came across the idea of financing my works through crowd funding, This allows me to realize my mission at the same time being empowered by the supporters. The idea of art being supported through grass-roots is a new form of creation that has huge potential toward new cultural sprout. I believe this is the positive creation cycle I had been looking for, and this is how I want to show next creative generation how to live.\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eABOUT PATREON\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a crowd-funding platform focused on artists. It is an efficient way for creators to earn ongoing revenue directly from their patrons, fans, \u0026amp; supporters. Patrons can pay a wishing fee \u003cem\u003eper month \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eper post\u003c/em\u003e that\n a creator makes.  This allows creators to stabilize the production cost of their creation in monthly basis. (For example, if you pay $2 per video, and the creator\n releases 2 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of \n$4 that month. )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe amount of pledge can be decided by patron.This can also be changed by the patron \nanytime.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e One-time pledge is also possible.
