This is where my fans come in. It doesn\u0027t\nneed to be much, and so my ambitions with this are fairly limited for the time\nbeing. With enough support I will be able to be self-sufficiently pursue all\nthe writing goals, as well as continue into the path of publishing. While I\nwill be actively going for traditional publishing, there are several WIP\nprojects I would like to publish myself.

Multiple mapbooks, again including lore of the fantasy world.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e3. A brand new, standalone novel called The Skeleton Eye.\u003c/li\u003e\n\n\u003cli\u003e4.
