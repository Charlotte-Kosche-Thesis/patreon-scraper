I\u0027m a queer, trans author of romance, fantasy, and\nhistorical fiction. Writing is my favorite thing in the world \u2014 I love to nerd\nout over plot structure, writing mechanics, and how stories are put together. I\nalso love writing the kind of books that would have changed my life if I had\nread them as a queer teen. If I\u0027ve learned anything from my publishing\nexperiences, it\u0027s that readers are equally hungry for these stories, and I\u0027m overwhelmingly grateful for the support I\u0027ve received so far. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy most recent releases are\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e Peter Darling\u003c/em\u003e \u2014 a queer, trans retelling of Peter Pan \u2014 and \u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eCaroline\u0027s Heart\u003c/em\u003e \u2014 a spooky, Southern Gothic-inspired trans romance about a cowboy, a witch, and a resurrection spell.

Peter\nDarling was written mostly during 20+ hour weekend sprints while I juggled\ncollege and a part-time job during the week; I now work full-time to support\nmyself and manage ongoing medical expenses from chronic injuries.
