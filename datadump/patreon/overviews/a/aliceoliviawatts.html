    "summary": "Hey lovelies! My name is Alice and I make YouTube videos about eating disorder recovery and overall health and well-being. My eating disorder recovery experience is a bit controversial, as I went against the advice of my dietitian and therapist and responded to my extreme hunger (my therapist would call it binge-eating) on a vegan diet (which my dietitian said was an eating disorder in and of itself). However, because I allowed myself to eat in abundance on a plant-based diet, I was able to fully recover from my eating disorder, rev up my metabolism, and now am able to effortlessly lose weight to achieve a healthy weight while eating 2,400-3,000+ calories a day! I share my experience in order to help and support others who find themselves in a similar place as I did. Those who are stuck in an eating disorder, those who are stuck in an yo-yo dieting cycle, those who feel they need to eat above what popular calorie calculators tell them they \"should\" eat, or those who want to be able to eat in abundance and still achieve their healthy ideal weight.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my personal life, I am\u00a0a full time student, hip hop dancer, hospital volunteer, and work part-time at a local vegan cafe. Making YouTube videos and answering questions on Tumblr, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube takes a LOT out of my free time. I\u0027ve unfortunately been hit with YouTube\u0027s new monetization system, and now all of the new videos I release are automatically demonetized. I have received so much love and support from you guys, and seeing how much my videos are helping some of you is what is fueling me to continue making videos. But the truth is, at the end of the day, I\u0027m a full-time student and I have to support myself which takes a lot of time away from creating content and connecting with you guys. By even donating $1 a month, it would make a huge difference in keeping my channel alive. Your support will help me continue to support you. You guys are amazing, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
