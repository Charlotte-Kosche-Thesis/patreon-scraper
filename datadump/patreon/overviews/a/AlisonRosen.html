Thanks for checking out my Patreon page.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eA lot of you have suggested I use Patreon because you are awesome and want to support the show. So many wonderful things in my life have happened at the suggestion of my listeners and I suspect this will be no exception. Your support will help make my dreams of expanding and growing the show a reality as well as go toward the weekly production of the show. Plus it keeps Wendy in kibble and hair bows which, if you follow my husband on Snapchat, you know is something he\u0027s into. (But really, video is a future goal and that requires $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(254, 46, 139);\"\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a place where fans can support the creators they care about on an ongoing basis. In exchange for your support, you\u0027ll get some cool perks and rewards in exchange.\u00a0Your support helps to cover the costs of running the podcast and keep the show on air.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(254, 46, 139);\"\u003eHow it works:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWith Patreon, you can pledge a couple bucks each month in support of the podcast. You\u2019ll also have access to perks like Google Hangouts, shout outs, your name on the website, Twitter follow, digital surprises, and much more.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e"
