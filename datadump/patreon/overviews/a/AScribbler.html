    "summary": "Hello there everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I go by Amy Scribbler and I am a budding author/reviewer. All my life, reading and writing has been not only a pass time, but also an escape from the boring lull of everyday life. Then, as I got older, I started to understand the beneficial and creative lifestyle that could come with not only creating my own world to work with in full length novels, but also the analytical side of looking at existing work and exploring what works and what doesn\u0027t. It pushed me through earning my English degree at University in the UK and even further to become a freelance writer for Buzz Magazine whenever I have the spare time and the approval of the editors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started off by writing my own stories, creating characters and worlds that I will hopefully, given the right amount of time and money, would be able to publish and advertise for the world to see. Also, to explore the more critical side of creativity, I created my own weekly blog in which I post reviews of everything from Books to TV Shows, Movies to Games. All of which I love doing and find it a fun challenge to keep to a time schedule and explore multiple genres and platforms through writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, all of this is easier said than done when you\u0027re struggling with two minimum wage jobs that don\u0027t give you the hours you were initially promised, have bills to pay as well as paying for the public transport to said jobs. Not to mention gathering subject after expensive subject for reviews and dealing with good old fashioned writers block. It all gets a bit much and money never stops becoming an issue. We\u0027ve all been there and a lot of us struggle to get out of there. But then again, that is what this website is all about, helping one creative mind to another to get to where we want to be in life. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love creating things through the power of words and one day I hope to have my work published. Until then, I can only do so much writing at a time keeping up with my weekly blogs and dragging my way through two jobs until some luck shines my way. Hopefully, with a little help from you lovely people, this will be that time. Thank you."
