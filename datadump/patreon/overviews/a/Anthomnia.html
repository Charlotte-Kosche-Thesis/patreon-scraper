    "summary": "\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHey! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo, I\u2019m going to jump to the point and hopefully shed some light on the current Youtube situation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI received a copyright strike on my channel. Though THOUSANDS of you stood in my defense and helped me reverse the strike, I still feel like I\u2019m suffering from this event. Unfortunately, my channel was hit very hard with the Demonetization wave that is still  causing huge issues with Youtube. I had over ten pages of videos all Demonetized at once. My channel, unfortunately because of this, came to a stand-still.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen a video is Demonetized, it gets less promotion from Youtube because, ultimately, that video earns less for them as a company. This effects me by impacting my earnings significantly. Couple this with the famous September slump, and you have a recipe for disaster.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always been transparent with you guys. I\u0027m NOT in the worst position ever. I have savings. I have money still coming from the videos I\u2019ve made, but this entire event has caused me to open my eyes and realize, Youtube is changing. I\u2019ve realized that I can be hit at any moment and my will to create and share with you all could be stomped out just as easily as a flame on a candle.\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bottom line is this; I\u2019m asking for help. It\u0027s something I hate doing. I\u0027ve preached that I hate asking for help, but if I want to continue creating on Youtube and having the sense of security I once had, I need this. Youtube is something so much more than a job to me. It\u0027s an opportunity to do something on a bigger scale, to help people that I\u2019d never have the chance to do if I was not into video creation. I had hoped to accomplish more, but I\u0027m worried my window of opportunity is shrinking. I\u2019ve only scratched the surface, but there\u2019s so much more charity donations that could help impact people on a personal level.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI do this because you all have helped me, in one way or another. In return I hope somewhere, I can help you, somehow. My goal isn\u0027t to make money. It never has been, and those of you that have been following me know that. Though unfortunate as it may be, money is what enables me to keep doing this and the giveaways that I love doing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, that\u0027s everything on the table. I\u0027ll also have a video that\u0027s in-depth on my channel if you want to check it out. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThanks for reading/watching!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-Anthony\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
