    "summary": "When I left the Des Moines Register (involuntarily) in September of 2017, I wasn\u0027t sure what I was going to do next. My wife wanted me to retire, so I briefly considered that option. Then I looked at my age and our current bank account, and the math didn\u0027t quite add up. So for the first time in more than 28 years, I needed to find a new job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA number of people suggested to me that I should start up my own website to cover Ankeny\u0027s high school sports. That sounded like a great idea to me, but I had no clue what it would cost to get a venture like that off the ground. Then I talked to Ankeny businessman Jason Loutsch, who was also hearing from a few people that Ankeny needed its own website to cover high school sports--to fill the void created by my departure from the Register.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are. Jason and I have teamed up to create AnkenyFanatic.com, which is scheduled to launch on Jan. 1, 2018. We want to be the go-to source for high school sports in Ankeny, covering everything related to the Hawks and Jaguars. We plan to have regular features, as well as updates on the numerous former Ankeny athletes who have taken their talents to the collegiate and professional levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe best thing about our website is that it will be free for anyone to visit. We considered going to a subscription-based model, but in the end we decided that we wanted Ankeny Fanatic to be a free website. We are hoping to generate enough revenue through advertising alone to make this venture a successful one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we don\u0027t know yet if that will be the case. The initial response from the community has been tremendous, but we still have a long way to go. And that is why we are asking for your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have a Patreon option to help fund AF. The goal of Patreon is to allow our content creators to focus more on creating and less on chasing advertising dollars. Patreon is safe and simple to use. You simply give them credit card information and whatever amount you choose to donate will come out once a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no obligation for anyone to do this. The site is going to remain free for everybody, regardless of if you donate or not. But if you appreciate our work and have a few extra bucks to give each month, we would really, really appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I\u0027m hoping that the Ankeny Fanatic community will become like a second family to me. And because I view all of you as my internet family, feel free to shoot me an email anytime if you have any questions, comments or suggestions. My personal email is \u003ca href=\"mailto:danmholm@yahoo.com\"\u003edanmholm@yahoo.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
