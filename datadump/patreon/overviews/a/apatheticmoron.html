Having a game in this stage of development will allow me to involve patrons to be included in the outcome of the game from the very beginning by making suggestions and voting on content to be included.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProduction - the game in current development (Sledgehammer of Light at this time). The goal here is to make a streamlined version of the game in a short a period as possible without succumbing to feature-creep.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePost-production - once a game has reached the full v1.0 release it will move to here with the aim of producing a patron-only v2.0. During this process the game will be updated with extra content such as side-quests, new game +, new endings and scenes, as well as edits to existing assets in response to patron criticism.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ultimate goal is to produce games that both patrons and myself feel happy with, and provide supporters with ample ability to have their say in the direction of the games I develop.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eHow Are Pledges Being Organised?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003ePatron pledges will be collected after a major update rather than a monthly basis as I\u0027m not confident in keeping a monthly update schedule. What do I mean by major update? Pretty much a content update of a considerable size and with a certain minimum number of new events and I will never make more than one \u0027major update\u0027 a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few minor updates can be expected where I add small amounts of content such as flavour text and more interesting NPCs or a small side-quest, event or something, but these will never be used to collect pledges.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo content updates will be charged until at least v0.3.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eCurrent Project:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s19.postimg.org/vdbtl8c7n/SHo_L_Titlescreen.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eThe Sledgehammer of Light (made in RPG Maker MV)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe cliche tale of the legendary Hero of Light striking out on a quest to vanquish the Demon Lord threatening the kingdom...

The goal is to have this version of the game released within 2 weeks of the Patreon version.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon version\u003c/strong\u003e - a version of the game exclusive to patrons.

A demo creeper is in the v0.1 game to showcase this reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSuggestion Box\u003c/strong\u003e - at various times patrons will be asked to provide suggestions for future content ie. NPC events, naming characters, side-quests and jobs etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Dungeon\u003c/strong\u003e - a dungeon exclusive to the Patreon version of the game populated with high level monsters designed by patrons which will include a scene if/when the heroines are defeated. Alternatively the dungeon also houses strange rifts and crystals through which events from different dimensions can be witnessed, say a Straw Hat orgy in the Thousand Sunny or a ruffian seducing an inebriated Dragonborn in a Skyrim inn, whatever a patron might desire. \u003cbr\u003e(Limited to one CG with 3 variations, pre-scene, during and after. Requires pledging at this level a minimum of 3 times. ApatheticMoron retains right of veto.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeta Testing\u003c/strong\u003e - my intention is put together a small team of beta testers for this game to test the game prior to release. Patrons of any level are able to apply to be included in the pool. Testers who prove themselves will be treated as $15 tier patrons and no longer have to support me to get the listed rewards. The beta version of the game will be released to higher tier patrons who don\u0027t mind playing a potentially buggy version for the chance to experience the content earlier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlpha version\u003c/strong\u003e - the version of the game I am currently working on. As a method of keeping myself accountable I will endeavour to zip up and release to patrons the current version of the game every fortnight. This is not meant to be a reward but a way for higher tier patrons to make sure they\u0027re satisfied with the progress I\u0027m making. It is guaranteed to be a rough, buggy experience with many placeholders for content yet to be implemented (maps, NPCs, dialogue and images).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron Events\u003c/strong\u003e - an event designed by a patron. Can be anything, from an encounter with bandits to being hired as a test subject for a wizard\u0027s new spell. The event can be a Bad End.\u003cbr\u003e(Limited to three CGs not including variations. Requires pledging at this level a minimum of 3 times. ApatheticMoron retains right of veto.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatron Side-quests\u003c/strong\u003e - a side-quest or event-chain designed by a patron. Maybe a pain in the arse escort quest with a perverted merchant with ulterior motives leading to a potential bad end or maybe a crystal that allows the player to live the experiences of a young couple during their honeymoon. Dare to dream, I\u0027m willing to do my best to realise your ideas but there will be limits on size and complexity.\u003cbr\u003e(Requires pledging at this level a minimum of 3 times. ApatheticMoron retains right of veto.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLimits on requested content\u003c/strong\u003e - as mentioned above I retain the right of veto for any content including but not limited to underage characters (I\u0027m happy to draw adult versions), no real people/celebrities, no scat, gore or vore. I also occasionally will have to exclude certain characters from certain scenes ie. no Max Caulfield or Chloe Price with anyone but each other and even then only strictly consensual. (I just want those girls to be happy...)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVersion numbering\u003c/strong\u003e - I\u0027ve noticed some fairly interesting version numbering in this area of game development so I think I\u0027ll make it clear what my usage of version numbering will be. Whole numbers ie v1 or v2, indicate a complete version of the game. Fractions, ie. 0.1 to 0.2, indicate an update, but not necessarily a major one - check the changelog. Fractions of fractions, ie. 0.0.1 to 0.0.2, indicate a bug fix, once again check the changelog, if you haven\u0027t experienced the bug that this update corrects it might not be worth the download.\u003cbr\u003e"
