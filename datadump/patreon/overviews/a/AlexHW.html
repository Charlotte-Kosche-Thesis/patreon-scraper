I have been creating art all my life, and do programming as a hobby. Working on games has been a great method of combining my passion for art with my need to program. Two thirds of my life has been spent prototyping and developing games, which began when my older brother introduced me to the concept when I was around nine or ten years old. I have created artwork professionally for over forty games, including two that I have developed independently.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are you currently working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.alexhw.com/patreon/smallCube.gif\"\u003e I work on various projects ranging from games to tools.

Eyeglasses do not help because the cornea itself becomes disfigured by bumps beneath the eyelids rubbing against it. The work I do requires focusing on small details for extended periods of time. It is important that I can see the detail in my work, but It can appear blurred for months on end along with headaches. If my right eye were affected too I would not be able to do any of my work. The medication for it is expensive. Earning money is not a simple matter for an artist in my position because the work I do doesn\u0027t fit the standard mold. That said, I\u0027ve decided to create this Patreon page. By sharing what I do in an interesting and accessible way where I can gain support, it might help alleviate the financial burden as well as physical or mental burdens. In time I might even be able to relocate to a place where I am less allergic.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.alexhw.com/patreon/smallCube.gif\"\u003e Your contributions help immensely with allowing me to continue developing projects that are meaningful to me and others.\u00a0If you become a patron of mine, you will be helping me develop useful tools for artists and creators around the world.
