The people who we once associated ourselves with are gone, but never forgotten. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe constructed our minds around our possibilities, and what ascend can truly do for not just us but to each and every listener, who we feel more and more connected to each and every day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIts the listener who the show is really about, because that person, can use what ever piece of information they can from\u00a0the show, to transform the life of themselves and their family, that in turn is the ripple affect that we seek from the podcast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we are both growing, we both come from humble backgrounds, we both are seekers, the more knowledge we gain the more we can share with you.
