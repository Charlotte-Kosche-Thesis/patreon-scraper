    "summary": "My name is Scout (like the little girl in To Kill a Mockingbird!) and i\u0027m 17 years old. I was born on December 15th, 1998, and I\u0027ve basically been drawing ever since!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI like to call myself a cartoonist. My main focus is on MLP, but I like to think that I can draw anything! My style of drawing includes thick line art and cell shading, which gives it a cartoony feel. This is the reasoning for my self-given \"title\".\u003cbr\u003eEach pledge will help me in many more ways than you might think! Even just $1 a month can help me to buy better art equipment, better programs, and can even get me classes on how to do what i do in a more efficient and better way. And even if the pledges don\u0027t go towards improving my art, they can go towards improving my quality of life!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI have a long list of medical problems, and a good few syndromes on my plate. One of these is Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS). This gives me chronic abdominal pain, chronic fatigue, brain fog, difficulty walking/standing, shaky hands, etc. Some days, I can\u0027t draw simply because one of my many symptoms has made it hard for me to do so properly. But, with proper treatment, this could all be gone soon enough. So, if your pledges happen to go towards anything non-art-related, it will certainly go towards maintaining the artist herself!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see the work that I post for everyone to see, you can choose to go to my DeviantArt! I post there very frequently, and even if I\u0027m not posting art, I\u0027m always online and available to chat with anyone who wants to :) You can see my DA here:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://amazing-artsong.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://amazing-artsong.deviantart.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for reading, and thank you to everyone who chooses to pledge!"
