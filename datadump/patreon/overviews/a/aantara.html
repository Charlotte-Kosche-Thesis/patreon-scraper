    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eHello!\u003c/h1\u003eIf you\u0027re new to the Etla Isle Continuity, then you may be wondering what all this is. Etla is a roleplay community that has been growing since 2001 on the multiplayer roleplay platform of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://cms.furcadia.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFurcadia\u003c/a\u003e. While the core game itself is more furry/anthro based, Etla has always been open to more imagination and has been home of a huge array of supernatural, fantasy, and mundane beings. Many of our players come from tabletop experience and use Furcadia as a place to more freely explore their characters\u0027 stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe benefit of the Furcadia platform is the visual aspect to an otherwise simple text-based roleplay format. I have spent countless hours over the past years collecting, adjusting, and creating new content for the world to keep the scenery fresh and engaging. I very much enjoy creating these small, isometric, pixel \u0027scenes\u0027 throughout both Eileadora and Valshiem cities that help to inspire and progress dynamic storytelling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003eAs Etla Isle is a continuity, the plot is ongoing and ever changing. We now host 2 of the larger cities on the island of Etla for people to be able to roleplay within a displayed setting. As stories progress, the cities are altered. People move in or out. Take up shops or start new businesses. Then, there are the occasional magical explosions that take out a building or two \u0026gt;.\u0026gt;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile a \u0027basic\u0027 setting could be built and the stories and roleplay left to the imagination, what has always set Etla apart is that the maps are regularly edited to reflect what is happening in the setting. Players have always had the option to have a home or shop customized to suit their characters and bring more richness to the experience. This does require a decent chunk of time to make these edits and to add to and update the item sets and digital assets to keep the cities evolving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows a way for the players to support my efforts in this continuous maintenance, while also gaining a few \u0027rewards\u0027 in exchange. Without the generosity of my Patrons, I don\u0027t know how this would all be possible. I am deeply grateful for their support and try to adjust this account to reflect the needs in the continuity as we progress. When we started we were updating from 8-bit to 32-bit, we\u0027ve done a major map overhaul (a couple times) and added a new secondary RP location (Valshiem). The goals here will change from time to time but the overall support and expansion of the continuity will always be the focus here.\u003cbr\u003e"
