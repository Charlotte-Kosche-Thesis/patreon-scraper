I am your host, lawyer, film critic, gentleman, bastard, gentleman bastard, Chris Jaramillo. I\u0027ve been writing film reviews for the past two years, and have been maintaining my own personal blog since January 2016. Within one year, I have produced 120 blog posts ranging from reviews to the world of the entertainment industry and general thoughts about film critique. Having seen over 100 films in theaters, I\u0027ve come to a major realization besides expanding my palette in cinema - going to see movies is expensive as hell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I would love to catch advance free screenings, my legal career comes first and therefore I cannot make several events due to time constraints. Hence, I keep my film watching for the weekends and whatever free time I have, which means having to shell out quite a bit of income to keep my review output up. But with your help, I can not only produce a consistent series of written critiques per week...but I can provide a diverse set of content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter going above and beyond my own expectations in 2016, I want to expand my own operations into the realms of podcast and video content for 2017. We\u0027ll start off small with cheaper cameras and microphones before upping the production values to more professional standards. But for now, the following will be the main feature for afterlobby.com:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Lobby Reviews\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy written reviews will continue on with the same...quality...previous readers have come to expect. Through Patreon, from January through mid-November, I\u0027ll be publishing three reviews per week on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays. From November to early January, reviews will increase to five or six per week to get in all the Oscar, Best of the Year, and Worst of the Year picks. And if some major news drops that affects the entertainment industry, I\u0027ll dedicate a separate post like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://afterlobby.com/2016/02/25/oscar-2016-predictions/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOscar Predictions\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll update this main post as we move into other content areas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards \u0026amp; Tiers\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFor the foreseeable future, there won\u0027t be any exclusive content for patrons. I\u0027d still like to provide as much quality content as I can, so I want it to be available for all audiences. However, Patrons will get advance notices for video and podcast review release dates and times, so you\u0027ll be the first to know when The After Lobby drops its latest and greatest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRisks \u0026amp; Challenges\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs I stated earlier, my legal career has and will continue to be my first priority. For the most part, I have a great grasp on work-life balance, but the life of an attorney can require my services in emergency situations. In the event delays occur, Patreons will be notified immediately and be provided with an updated deadline for written reviews or other kind of productions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSee you at the Lobby...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBefore starting The After Lobby, I had received multiple requests from people on Facebook to open up my own website to manage and maintain my collection of reviews. Since the website began, I\u0027ve received many more requests on expanding The After Lobby and I\u0027m very excited to see where Patreon can help me to meet those demands. Not sure what the future holds, but I\u0027ve got a feeling it\u0027s gonna be a hell of a ride. Come and join me at the Lobby\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
