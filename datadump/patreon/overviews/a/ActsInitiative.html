We do what we do because we want to see other Christians waking up, too, and adopting the mindset that the Book of Acts believers had.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMeaning...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the Book of Acts, the early Church practiced a kind love and obedience that is foreign to us today. They acted on the conviction that they should share everything, live as one, demonstrate love through their actions, and eagerly wait for the return of the Lord. They kept their focus on the things of heaven and not the things of this world. When Christians live like this - like we\u2019re supposed to! - the world sees Jesus. (John 17:20-23). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Book of Acts believers anxiously await Jesus\u2019 return and kept their eyes on the things of heaven (Col 3:2). They were so un-human in their displays of love and compassion towards others that the world was taken aback. (John 13:34-35). They counted nothing as their own but gave freely. (Acts 4:32-35). They really did seek His kingdom and righteousness... first, only, and always. (Matt 6:33).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that this is Real Christianity, and is key to abolishing the spiritual dryness, selfishness, and apathy that is so prevalent in the modern Church.  If the modern Church returns to this right way of living we believe we will see the number of saved souls increasing massively. (Acts 4:33). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe believe that it\u0027s possible to resurrect Real Christianity, the kind that can change our city (and yours!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps us reach more people, and we don\u0027t take any gift lightly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e----------\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA few of the practical things we do with funds:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Provide meals and Bibles to the homeless of Pensacola, FL (one care package costs $5.02)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Reach people online with our free books, music, and videos\u00a0($25 reaches about 350 people on social media)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Cover travel expenses for food distribution, and speaking and singing engagements\u00a0(we don\u0027t charge to visit when invited)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Cover the man-hours needed to distribute food, write, edit, record, publish, and produce new content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Cover film shoot location expenses and props as needed\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Cover website and general ministry maintenance costs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Print hardcopies of our books, teachings, CDs and DVDs for free give away\u003cbr\u003e"
