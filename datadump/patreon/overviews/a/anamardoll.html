I\u0027ll light a fire in the hearth, bring you a blanket and a lap-cat, and pour a warm beverage of your choice. If you wait long enough I\u0027ll get to rambling at you. My goal for this Patreon is to ramble at you at least once a month in a sufficiently entertaining or thought-provoking manner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI tell stories.\u003c/strong\u003e I tell stories about fat, physically disabled, mentally ill, transgender, bisexual people because I didn\u0027t have many such stories growing up. So I spin them now. My characters live in worlds that try to harm them, but they find acceptance and community and love of all flavors because they are wonderful beautiful souls who deserve hope and joy. Kinda like us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI rant sometimes.\u003c/strong\u003e I get sucked into politics and social stuff, and I like to make my points on the internet in witty snippets punctuated with use of capslock FOR EMPHASIS. I\u0027m very rarely angry and I\u0027m strongly anti-harassment so I try not to call people out by name, but I do post about stuff-n-things when I get heated on a topic. A lot of these tie into the books, movies, or media I\u0027m consuming because I have a strong interest in storytelling as an art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI like to talk and talk and \u003cem\u003etalk\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0about storytelling as an art.\u003c/strong\u003e There\u0027s gonna be posts about my writing and why I made the choices I did and what they mean to me and metaphors and crafting and culture and... yeah, that\u0027ll happen when I get going. Sorry. I\u0027ll try to keep it to a minimum, but I\u0027m like a puppy with a very shiny new yellow tennis ball. I just wanna gnaw on the topic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing. I do it as much as I possibly can, when my back isn\u0027t flaring up and my depression isn\u0027t sending my brain into a haze. So I\u0027m setting up this Patreon as a medical care fund for myself to pay for my pain medicines and my depression treatments. The goal is for me to treat the things that keep me from writing so that I can then turn around and \u003cem\u003ekeep writing\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027re here with me. I can\u0027t tell you what it means, having an audience who \u003cu\u003ewants\u003c/u\u003e to read what I have to say. People who choose to support me because they like me and my work and want me to keep going. Knowing you\u0027re here gets me up in the morning on the bad days when the brain-haze and pain-fog twins settle in for a long visit. Thank you. Thank you.
