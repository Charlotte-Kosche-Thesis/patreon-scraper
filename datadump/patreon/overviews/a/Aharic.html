    "summary": "\u00a0 \u00a0If you are unfamiliar with \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, I encourage you to explore and learn more about it. \u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s amazing\u003c/strong\u003e. Patreon has been featured in Wired Magazine, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes, The Guardian, and the Trendsphere in general. In less than a year and half, over 125,000 people have become patrons of creators on Patreon paying them over $1 million every month and enabling them to share their work with the world. \u003cstrong\u003eThis. Is. Huge.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Patreon is taking the next step in the Crowdfunding phenomenon by bringing the classic model of patronage to the internet. \u003cstrong\u003eC\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ereators are supported by hundreds of Patrons\u003c/strong\u003e that collectively fund the art that they want to see. Patrons are also thanked directly by the artists they support with rewards, unique gifts, and services they create to suit their audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Your account and the pledge system let you follow as many artists as you want for free and \u003cstrong\u003eyou even receive a Timeline like feed of all your artists and their latest creations.\u003c/strong\u003e It is your choice to support with a monthly pledge, but just consuming and sharing what you find IS supporting by giving the artist what they crave (an audience) and helping them grow that audience into a revenue source that will fund their art and the Patron rewards they can offer. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0You can create an account using your Facebook profile or you can create a separate log in just for Patreon. You can set your own pledge cap so you never get over charged, you can cancel at anytime, and the service is backed by Paypal.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0In the spirit of THIS Patreon Campaign, and to remind you that you are in the right place, \u003cstrong\u003eI encourage you to keep reading. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy you should Pledge to me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0To me, writing is its own consciousness and consciousness is the universe\u2019s way of learning about itself while creating itself. Everyone takes part in creating and discovering the universe, and writing is my contribution to creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0When you pledge to me, I only want you to pledge for one reason (feel free to have any other reason at all, though). \u003cstrong\u003eYou like my writing. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0It speaks to you, it moves you, it inspires you, it entertains you, it challenges you, it twists you up so you hate to love it, and you want more. This is the reason I want you to pledge, so that I can give you more of what you like while reaching my campaign goal. To be a career Novelist.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Any pledge amount will make you an official Patron and give you access to the\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ePatrons Only Feed\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0where you can discuss stories, ideas, the \u003cstrong\u003eMilestone Puppy Mascot \u003c/strong\u003ename, and even influence what larger works you want to see completed. If you are more of a writer, voracious reader, want to be more directly involved in the campaign, or you just want the incentives, then you should pledge your way into the more interactive tiers designed to bring you into the world of writing and collaboration. Some tiers invite you to workshop with other Patrons and/or me, have me Ghostwrite a novel for you, recieve hard copies of all books and stories, and if you are truly adventurous (or a talented egoist) then there is no warning you against the final tier. \u003cstrong\u003eThe Secret Window. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Thank you for taking the time to check out my profile and being a part of it. Sharing my profile and the Patreon web sight in general is also a major way to support. So, please \u003cstrong\u003egrab that URL up there and share it with a reader or writer\u003c/strong\u003e. Or several many readers and writers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0Every month I will publish a short story for free.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e  Thank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My name is Aharic Bouy, and I have been stuck on writing since I knew what it was. It is an obsession. If I am not writing then I am thinking about it. It takes sincere concentration to keep my mind clear for anything else. I have had a few formal experiences writing advertising and news copy along with a few years worth of academic writing, but creative writing has always been my refuge. I enjoy and respect all types of writing, but my heart lives in the Novel. I believe that the Novel is the complete experience. The sum total of every poem penned, every short story scribbled, and every epiphany experienced coming together to form the Novel.  \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I started this Patreon Campaign to give my writing a home, a presence, and to eventually become a financial support structure so I can write full time. The concept behind Patreon is simple and empowering in that it makes me feel as if every step I take towards my goal is true to that end by operating on a platform free from \"Market Value\" demands. A place where my work comes from my fans as much as for them. Patreon is a place where I can write, share, and with Patrons, find enough support to dedicate my life to writing Novels. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I have designed the Pledge Tiers and Milestones to give everyone access to what happens along the way as well as offer immediate rewards for those that want to be more invested and involved in the campaign. Some tiers offer you the opportunity to write your own novel with my hands or have a novel written just about you. Please, take a moment to explore more rewards along with some of my more ambitious Milestones. Then, take a look at some Writing. Thank you for your interest and thank you for supporting the arts!",

It could be about you for someone else, about someone else for you, or about your cat for your dog (this might involve meeting your cat). If you have a specific genre, theme, mood, or plot you want explored, I invite you to direct the piece further.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0There is really no limit but the ones we leave unexplored when it comes to creative writing and this is my way of showing how much it means to me to be able to explore and share because of your pledge. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003c/strong\u003e",
