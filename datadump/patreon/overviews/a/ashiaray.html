     "description": "What if employers, co-workers, policy-makers, and even our friends and family understood that maternity leave is not a choice, but \u003cstrong\u003enecessity for the survival of humanity\u003c/strong\u003e? \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhat if they could \u003cstrong\u003esee \u003c/strong\u003ethe necessity of supporting the mental and physical health of our workforce and our next generation?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can write and write and write, but \u003cstrong\u003ereading can\u0027t connect in the way \u003cem\u003eseeing\u003c/em\u003e can\u003c/strong\u003e. Those of us who write our truth - especially the hard parts, face a nasty backlash. Those of us who slip up just once, face vitriol and a monsoon of shame. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUnless we \u003cem\u003eshow\u003c/em\u003e the world - they will tell us we \u003cem\u003echose \u003c/em\u003ethis, that it\u0027s \u003cem\u003eour\u003c/em\u003e responsibility - \u003cem\u003eAlone\u003c/em\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe knew it would be hard, but we didn\u0027t know it would be crushing. We\n didn\u0027t know about the judgement and shame we would face with every small decision, the lack of \nsupport, and the impossible costs of childcare. We didn\u0027t know because we couldn\u0027t see it. That was not our choice - and that doesn\u0027t mean we should struggle quietly, leaving the next generation to stumble because of our silence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA healthy society cannot survive like this. We can\u0027t do this alone - And we don\u0027t have to.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not selfish to choose a family - to raise the children to be the farmers who will grow our food, the doctors who will care for us, and the teachers and scientists who will improve humanity and the planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eThose who are not mothers cannot value what we do because they cannot see it\u003c/strong\u003e - they don\u0027t understand the full impact and long-term health complications that pregnancy and childbirth creates on our bodies. They do not understand the exorbitant cost of childcare as we struggle to keep our jobs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who cannot see it don\u0027t understand the crushing daily judgement we face no matter how we feed, clothe, or educate our children. Our social circles, experts, and schools encourage quality family time while our employers demand 60-hour work weeks to prove that being a mother does not make us a lesser employee. We are called to become strong female leaders while searching for employers who will hire us despite our demographic \u0027risk\u0027 of pregnancy or position as parents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWe must raise the next generation to understand that what we do matters. We must show our policy makers. We must explain the economic impact of failing to support the next generation of humanity.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can tell the story a family as they cross the divide into parenthood. I can show the hard work and complications of childbirth, the hectic and exhausting routines of maternity leave, and the agonizing decisions (or lack of choice) mothers face as they juggle parenthood, the majority of housework, and efforts to support families while staving off post-partum depression and anxiety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eParenting can be a difficult but rewarding joy. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t have to be \u003cem\u003ethis\u003c/em\u003e hard.
