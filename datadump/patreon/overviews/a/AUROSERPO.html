My brand is called Auro Serpo Art, with \"auro\" meaning \"I gilt/make gold,\" and \"serpo,\" \"I slither.\" I find snakes themselves, visually, a mix of beauty and horror. Their depiction in ancient art and religion is vast and fascinating, often portrayed as a villian even when beautifully sculpted, painted or gilded. Their adaptability to live in water, trees, foliage, desert, etc., is further inspiration for myself and my art. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAURO SERPO ART is the vessel through which I needed to express my love for contrasting elements of beauty, as well as emotional unease, abstract motifs and darker feelings, executed honestly and instinctively.\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhy I Am Motivated\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSince moving to Switzerland, I have unfortunately been unemployed, leading to me taking that free time to delve more into my art than I ever have previously. I found a lot of personal satisfaction in this, and the progress that eventually showed itself was an inertia that has helped keep my motivation going. It also reassured me that being self employed would be an extremely rewarding and fitting model of work for me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0The feedback I received from my family, friends, and online followers on my improvement and style development is a large force behind my motivation to continue to create. The willingness and honest eagerness of these individuals to pay for my work, alongside their encouragement, has pushed me to keep trying for the biggest audience I can. And I am so excited to improve, evolve, perfect, and establish my place as an artist alongside an audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat Brings Me To Patreon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0I have been able to sell my work to a small group of individuals who choose to support me, thanks to their genuine connection and appreciation for my work.

I enjoy discussing art as much as I do creating it, and find sharing thoughts with others in the same community as part of the nature of creating\u003cbr\u003e\u25cf Insight on future or current projects before they go public.
