    "summary": "First of all, thank you to everyone reading this. Making this decision wasn\u0027t easy, but after contemplating doing this for quite some time, I felt this was the best option that would allow me to expand my site, Forward Progressives, into new ventures that I\u0027ve been wanting to do for quite some time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs someone who got in the \"politics game\" to make a difference, the inability to expand my site beyond just basic blogging and analysis has frustrated me for quite a while. Unfortunately, being an extremely small operation, and already dedicating 7-days a week to this career over the last several years, time is something of which I am not in great abundance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is why I created this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore revenue means I\u0027ll have the ability to invest more into Forward Progressives. My goal is to bring on more writers which would then allow me to expand our influence even further than it is now. With a larger staff we\u0027d be able to produce more YouTube videos, start a podcast, and write more in-depth and investigative/research articles. I\u0027m also wanting to finally start on a book I\u0027ve been wanting to write exposing the hypocrisies of Republicans, but I just haven\u0027t had the time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a world where there\u0027s so many important issues we\u0027d like to cover, far too often we\u0027re left having to decide which ones we\u0027re okay not writing or talking about because we simply don\u0027t have the time or staff to cover them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, what I feel we have at Forward Progressives is something special and I want to improve upon it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf people feel inclined to be a part of that by becoming one of our \"Patreons,\" that\u0027s amazing. Again, thank you, thank you.. thank you. If not, that\u0027s fine, too. I grew up dirt poor and I take care of a mother who \"lives\" on around $600 a month, so I understand what it\u0027s like to live literally penny to penny. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust the support myself and my site gets from our followers is amazing and makes us realize why we make the sacrifices we do in order to keep Forward Progressives running.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo for everyone who does decide to donate, again, thank you. I will be forever humbled at the thought that there are people out there who actually enjoy reading or hearing things I have to say or what my site produces.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAllen Clifton\u003cbr\u003eCo-founder, Forward Progressives\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
