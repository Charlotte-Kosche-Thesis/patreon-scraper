Objective, independent and strong voices that are not beholden to promoting special interests can make a huge difference in the narrative. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHi. I\u2019m Andreas M. Antonopoulos and since 2012, when I found bitcoin and became obsessed with the technology, I\u2019ve worked to become one of those objective, independent, and strong voices. So far I\u2019ve published three books, spoken at more than 200 events (many of them free to attend), and have made several hundred freely available educational videos explaining the technology. I\u2019m passionate about this technology and the ways it can be used to give choice to the choiceless, voice to the voiceless, and power to the powerless.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027re here, you\u2019ve probably seen some of my work already and you realize how much time, money, and effort goes into producing original content with an independent perspective. What you might not know is that almost all of the content I produce is both free and open-source, and will remain so forever. It\u2019s available under creative commons licenses; anyone can read and share the content for free. More importantly, anyone can re-use, mashup, translate, re-invent and even commercialize this work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI use creative commons licensing because I believe in the commons, the community. I believe this technology can be a great equalizer and that people all around the world can become empowered by learning about this technology - we can change our own communities and build new organizations that can benefit us all.\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you share this vision, and can afford to support it, then please do so.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nConsider becoming a patron if you: \n\u003cbr\u003e\n- have learned about bitcoin and open blockchains from my talks or articles\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- have sent my work to a friend, colleague, or \"naysayer\" to teach them about this tech\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- are tired of the corporate agenda driven talks that seem to dominate the industry\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- value free educational resources for yourself and the community\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- appreciate my work and want to see more of it\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support, at any level, helps me to continue doing this important work\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e -\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThank you\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n- Andreas\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eF.A.Q.\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eQ: Where, exactly, will my money go if I support you on Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour support on Patreon will directly fund these projects in 2018 (and many more): \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUniversity and Community Library Free Book Program: \u003c/strong\u003eWe share a common goal; we want people around the world to be able to learn about bitcoin and related technologies. Not just those people who currently have reliable internet access but everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOnce a month we will donate The Internet of Money, Volume One; The Internet of Money, Volume Two; and Mastering Bitcoin to ten (10) Universities or Community Libraries that you -- patrons -- choose.

Later this year, I plan to visit cities in the U.S., Canada, Europe, and possibly Australia. I\u2019ll be sure to post the details when they\u2019re available and, of course, I\u2019ll still be hosting Patreon only Happy Hours in each city for patrons at or above the $10 level of support. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWebsite Redesign: \u003c/strong\u003eMany of you have mentioned that my website antonopoulos.com needed improvement. Okay, many of you have said \u201cwhat the hell is that piece of crap presenting itself as your website\u201d.  I heard you. Recently, I updated the website template but that\u2019s just the beginning. This year we are completely redesigning the entire website, with the goal of making all of my content easy to find, aggregating it in one place, and making it available in multiple formats - like videos, audio / podcasts, and articles. It\u2019s a big project but we hope to have it finished by September. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eJobs:\u003c/strong\u003e In order to grow the business, and reach more people throughout the world, my team needs to grow. Today, in addition to me, we have three part-time people on the team but there is so much more we want to accomplish. We plan to increase hours, up to full-time for the current positions and, if the Patreon base continues to grow, we will try to add up to seven more part-time people, over the next two years (including a Spanish-language community manager).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat your donation does not fund:\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYour pledge does not purchase my speech:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Quite the opposite in fact -your donations give me the independence to speak my mind. My political, social, and philosophical views may differ from yours. I\u2019m passionate about justice; I\u2019m incensed at injustice and I proudly speak up about issues that are important to me. I hope you do too. The world is a better place when people are not afraid to speak truth. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eYour pledge does not fund my fun and it isn\u2019t my only source of income:\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Patreon supports my work, but the donations alone are not (yet) enough to support the team and projects to reach all of our 2018 goals and beyond. We dream big.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ: Why aren\u0027t you fundraising in bitcoin or another cryptocurrency?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nOne of the best features about bitcoin is that it isn\u0027t suited for recurring payments. With bitcoin, you would need to authorize the payment monthly. Every single month; which is a huge hassle for most people. In the future we might be able to use a smart contract for recurring payments but we\u0027re not there yet. For now, Patreon represents the best option for this kind of ongoing fundraising. A consistent, recurring stream of income allows me to budget and plan for the long term.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eQ: Why aren\u0027t you doing an ICO?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nICOs are for companies with products. I\u0027m not selling a product, I\u0027m producing open source content. \n\u003cstrong\u003eThe return on investment here isn\u0027t monetary, this is about building an educational resource for people all over the world. \u003c/strong\u003eThe return comes from knowing you\u0027ve made this work possible and from knowing others will take the work and build upon it. Also because most ICOs are scams, be careful out there friends. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
