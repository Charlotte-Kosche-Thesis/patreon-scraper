    "summary": "Thank you so very much for taking the time out of your busy day to read this.\u00a0 Just over 4 years ago the last startup I was part of went under, and I needed to finish school, and look for work.\u00a0 To help pay bills in the meantime I turned to a skillset that I had learned in the boy scouts when I was young.\u00a0 At first it was just a few commissions, a piece of armor for a friend of mine for their cosplay, or another persons for their Larp character.\u00a0 But as time went on it became so much more.\u00a0 I started making radio holsters for festival workers, Jedi/Sith belts for cosplayers, and more, and more custom requests.\u00a0 Difficult pieces pushing the boundaries of my skill, and each piece building off of techniques learned on the past piece.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I make mostly custom pieces, and full suits of leather armor, with custom designs hand carved, and tooled into the leather.\u00a0 But, and here is where you can help, materials are expensive, details take time, and the only machine I use is myself.\u00a0 The occasional use of a laser cutter/etcher when the need strikes.\u00a0 Very rarely do I even make use of a sewing machine, and only then for select pieces, when hand stitching is just not practical.\u00a0 I have been hand to mouthing it for a few years now, and I am very close to being able to produce enough stock to get to festivals, and conventions.\u00a0 Any help, help pays for materials, shipping, and new tools to take my art to the next level.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
