Patreon is a subscription based\nplatform offering a more intimate and symbiotic relationship\nbetween artists and listeners than standard music sales platforms. Rather\nthan buying whole albums from me you can offer me a pledge in\nexchange for my latest tracks, production tips, stories of my inspiration and creative process,\u00a0unreleased content,\nvideo chat and more. You can choose how much you offer, set a\nmonthly max, and change or stop your subscription as you please. By\nchoosing to support me in this way you offer me the stability of a\ncalculated influx of funds that I can allocate towards the most necessary requirements in my life to continue my creation of music. Check\nout the rewards section below for details on what the different tiers have to offer. Also, you can check out my goals column on the left side of this page to find out\nabout my longer term visions that are germinating as you read this. Thank YOU for enjoying my creations and and supporting me! From my heart to yours, so much love. \u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
