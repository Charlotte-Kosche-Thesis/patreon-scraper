    "summary": "Thank you for coming to check out my page! If you are already a supporter, I appreciate you and the higher standard of living you help me achieve while I\u0027m going through the process of doing the actual writing. If you are not a supporter, you\u0027re quite welcome to come in and have a look around, and see if there\u0027s anything you like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI plan to release the equivalent of a 5,000 word chapter every 2 weeks in exchange for payment from my supporters.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I did so for the first novel without missing a single deadline, and this pace is sufficiently challenging but sustainable. If you read the fiction as it comes out, thank you, and I welcome your thoughts! If not, I appreciate your support as a tangible gesture and am grateful for that even if you never read a word of the fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon has allowed me a level of support from people JUST LIKE YOU as I finished the first novel here, the Savage Worms of Silkshore. That novel is being processed, edited, in layout, all that good stuff that happens between when the draft is finished and when it\u0027s available for sale.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I\u0027m working on the next book. In the process of figuring out who my characters are for the first book, I generated a lot more information and plot hooks than would fit in one novel. Looking at my favorite plot threads we didn\u0027t get to informed what I might focus on in the next novel. We\u0027re skipping a brief interval and seeing how our friends are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course there\u0027s been a status quo disrupting event to throw things out of kilter, and it\u0027s time to seek a new balance as power sloshes around, redistributing. If you\u0027re new here, I welcome you to consider the background of these stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired by the award-winning role playing game Blades in the Dark by John Harper, this novel takes place in the ghost-haunted shadows of the industrial port city Doskvol. Electroplasm runs the defenses of the city, but its true power comes from muscle, blood, and grit. Bluecoats protect the status quo and the wealthy, and that\u0027s as close to law enforcement as it gets here. The highest law is the Iron Law of Distribution--them that has, gets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been involved as a fan from the beginning when Blades in the Dark was a Kickstarter role playing game. Over the course of extensive engagement on the online fan community and many sessions running the game, I developed a familiarity with the game setting. John Harper invited me to write a few essays for the finished Blades in the Dark book. I also created a heist deck to help GMs whip up heists complete with obstacles, treasures, and personalities, on short notice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will write this book, and when it is done I look forward to publishing it. This Patreon represents an opportunity for you to see the book as it takes shape, and to help support me as an author while I\u0027m working on it. I thank you for taking a look at the project, and for any enthusiasm, advertising, and funding you can add to the effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe official Blades in the Dark RPG book is out, and it is stuffed with people, locations, and more that is ready to be looted for each game table--and for a novel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFor the cover image here, I used a Blades in the Dark logo, runes by Bradford Elliott, \"Thief by the Riddler\" font, and the Kirsty font.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlades in the Dark can be found here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.evilhat.com/home/blades-in-the-dark/\"\u003ehttps://www.evilhat.com/home/blades-in-the-dark/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy heist deck can be found here: \u003ca href=\"https://fictivefantasies.wordpress.com/2016/01/21/duskwall-heist-deck/\"\u003ehttps://fictivefantasies.wordpress.com/2016/01/21...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
