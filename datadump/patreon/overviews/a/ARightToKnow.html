This has been my mission, passion, and frankly I feel my\nresponsibility.  Well my friends and patrons, more than ever, with the\ncurrent censorship attack being waged on Free Speech, it\u2019s time for me to \u201cget\nback in the ring\u201d and \u201cpump up the volume\u201d with \u003cem\u003eA Right to Know\u00ae\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eA Right to Know\u00ae\u003c/em\u003e continues to create\nbroadcasts bringing forth critical, cutting-edge and timely REAL News to \u003cem\u003eWe\nThe People\u003c/em\u003e in an effort to take back our sovereignty and our earth from\nthose who\u2019ve hijacked and decimated both for way too long!  We explore\nwho\u2019s responsible for the \u201chijacking\u201d, and what has been their MO (modus\noperandi).  We also cover what some amazing people have been doing to turn\nthings around, and most importantly what\nwe can do, to take back our freedoms and heal our planet, especially for our children and generations that\nfollow us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell, I\nbelieve Shakespeare \u003cem\u003ehit the nail on the head\u003c/em\u003e when he wrote\u2026\u201cMe thinks\nshe doth protest too much!\u201d  As many are aware, there has been a\ncoordinated censorship attack waged against the entire independent media by\nGoogle, YouTube, \u0026amp; Facebook.  Obviously REAL NEWS that empowers \u003cem\u003eWe\nThe People\u003c/em\u003e is indeed getting out, and now even our \u201cindependent media\u201d has\nbeen infiltrated and those journalist reporting the REAL NEWS are being\ntargeted and stripped not only of their You Tube ad revenues, but their\nright to free speech.  I\u0027m delighted to say this is where\nPatreon comes in\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt appears obvious\nto me, that after eons of\ninformation suppression\u2026that we\u2019re\non the cusp of world-changing events and humanity-saving secrets being brought\nforth to \u003cem\u003eWe The People\u003c/em\u003e!  I\nfeel that those who\u2019ve been controlling the output of propaganda mainly\nin the mainstream media, are really ramping up their censorship in fear that\nwe\u2019ll awaken to their tricks and no longer be under their enslavement\u2026Which\nmakes us all quadruple curious as to what they\u2019re trying to hide from the\nmasses and why!?  I\u2019m curious as hell\u2026aren\u2019t you!?  This is where \u003cem\u003eA\nRight to Know\u00ae \u003c/em\u003ecomes in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now is a critical time for wo-mankind to broadcast\nREAL NEWS!  We\u2019ve been bombarded and lied to with FAKE NEWS and false\nhistories by the well-oiled mainstream propaganda machine run by the corporations\nand one-per-centers controlling it.  It\u2019s time to tune out and unplug from\ntheir lies and manipulation, and shift our time, focus, and energy tuning into\nshows like \u003cem\u003eA Right to Know\u00ae, \u003c/em\u003esupporting REAL NEWS and placing humanity\nand Mother Earth first and foremost.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n \u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn \u003cem\u003eA Right to Know\u00ae\u003c/em\u003e I interview those in-the-know,\nwhistleblowers, truthers, experts, \u0026amp; real people who understand the\nabsolute necessity and timeliness of sharing this information, restoring our\nsovereignty, and healing our\nplanet starting this very moment\u2026So keep it tuned and thank you so much for\nyour support and becoming a patron in this grand cause, I could not do it without\nyou.  And remember\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou have \u003cem\u003eA Right to Know\u00ae\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e"
