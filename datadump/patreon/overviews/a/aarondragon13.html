    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHey there, I\u0027m the author of a number of fictions that can be found on Royal Road Legends. You may know me from past works such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/fiction/6893/dungeon-instinct\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDungeon Instinct\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/fiction/5965/black-blood-dropped\"\u003eBlack Blood\u003c/a\u003e, or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/fiction/13442/dungeon-of-night\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDungeon of Night\u003c/a\u003e... Otherwise you will have probably come here because of my newer fictions like\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/fiction/16797/before-the-end\"\u003eBefore The End\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway I write stories, not all of which I post on Royal Road, in the genres of (Dark)Fantasy and LitRPG. I\u0027m creating this Patreon because I started writing as a hobby a few years ago, and it turned out that some people on the interwebs actually liked what I put out. Unfortunately as the cruel march of time moves on I have found myself so bogged down with work, school, and family health issues that I\u0027ve had little time to write. This Patreon will hopefully help my readers support me and my writing, and that in turn could help take some of the pressure off and ensure I write more often.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy ultimate and unrealistic hope is that I might be able to supplement my income with the generous offerings of you fans and readers, and if I end up getting enough I can turn this whole writing thing into my full time job. I can always hope right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless feel free to look around, surf my posts and see if anything catches your eye!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
