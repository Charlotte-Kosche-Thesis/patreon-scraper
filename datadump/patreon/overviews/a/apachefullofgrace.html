I\u2019m tall \u0026amp; I wear glasses. I have a full time job because I have to. When I\u2019m not at work, I make satirical (\u0026amp; sometimes not-so-nice) drawings of political people (which may include anyone). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nThe goal is to live \u0026amp; work as an editorial cartoonist, though the days of living \u0026amp; working as an editorial cartoonist are long gone.\u003c/strong\u003e We do have social media, which is a great way to disseminate your work \u0026amp; get paid for none of it. This Patreon is my first attempt to do what I\u2019ve always wanted: to get paid for doing what I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u2019re a fan of what I do, I want to say thank you very much.\u003c/strong\u003e I couldn\u2019t do this without the love \u0026amp; support I get from you. If you decide to become a patron, you\u2019ll have access to all sorts of stuff you never knew you wanted to have access to. Daily updates with drawings \u0026amp; sketches, prints \u0026amp; postcards in your mail, occasional videos (I\u2019m learning). You\u2019ll see works in progress as I take it from sketches to a finished piece.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAgain, I thank you\u003c/strong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
