My name is Adrian Ropp and I\u0027ve been working in the entertainment industry for over 25 years as a storyboard artist, animation director and comic book artist. I live in Utah with my wife and four cats, where I am my family\u0027s sole breadwinner.\u00a0 I\u0027ve created this Patreon account to share my art with all the great people who have supported me throughout my career. (And, if I\u0027m being totally honest, to help me continue to bring new artwork and comics to life!)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LyjiFQwsayo/USdKZ7R2WuI/AAAAAAAAB8I/nJJGlSe2Xp0/s1600/Disney-Infinity-logo.jpg\" style=\"width: 196px;\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDISNEY INFINITY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI served as Lead Story Artist on the hit video game franchise, Disney Infinity - specifically focused on Mickey Mouse, Cars, Monsters University, Marvel\u0027s Avengers, Marvel\u0027s Guardians of the Galaxy, and Star Wars. I even got to create an alternate fight scene for the Force Awakens Play Set!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNR1vC76XYI\"\u003eStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://www.midtowncomics.com/images/PRODUCT/FUL/1692132_ful.jpg\" style=\"width: 107px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.midtowncomics.com/images/PRODUCT/FUL/1666003_ful.jpg\" style=\"width: 107px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.midtowncomics.com/images/PRODUCT/FUL/1624568_ful.jpg\" style=\"width: 107px;\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://www.midtowncomics.com/images/PRODUCT/FUL/1676267_ful.jpg\" style=\"width: 105px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCOMIC BOOK WORK\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the past few years I\u0027ve had the opportunity to work on comic books featuring some of the most well-known cartoon characters of the century. So far, I\u0027ve worked on some great stuff for Archie Comics, Pink Panther, Underdog, The Three Stooges, Casper the Friendly Ghost and Hot Stuff. I\u0027m currently the main artist for the Rocky \u0026amp; Bullwinkle comic book series. I also have a webcomic called\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.chimchum.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChim Chum and the Portly Samurai\u003c/a\u003e that debuts as a comic book series in January 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI occasionally attend comic book conventions and create my own comics and art, and I have a goal to some day publish a couple of amazing graphic novels I\u0027ve been brewing for over a decade. The support I get from Patreon goes toward covering my travel and printing costs as well as the development of my comics stories. Additionally, Patreon is a great platform for interacting with fans and friends! I love sharing my process with my patrons!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eTHE REWARDS\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003eSo here\u0027s how it works. You can donate any amount, even $1, and I\u0027ll make sure you get something fun. (Previews, discount codes on my shop, exclusive posts.) If you make a monthly donation to\u00a0my Patreon account of at least $4 (you can cancel any time) and at very least you will have a 5 x 7 \"Postcard of the Month\" mailed to your U.S. address. Different\u00a0price tiers bring with them additional rewards: bonus postcards and credits earned toward original art commissions. Postcards are typically mailed out the third week of each month, and they are high quality, professionally printed products. Here are some of my past postcard rewards:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/0999/i/2017/257/9/3/something_there_by_toonbaboon-dbnf291.jpg\" style=\"width: 254px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/fc7e/i/2017/249/e/0/sha_la_la_la_la_la___don_t_be_shy__by_toonbaboon-dbmn6l6.jpg\" style=\"width: 261px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\t\t\u003cstrong\u003eTHE BONUSES\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been known to send special extras for my patrons and offer them special discounts if they meet me at conventions. For example, in January 2018 I gave all $4+ patrons a free digital copy of my new art book. I also tend to give them VERY advanced previews of my upcoming work and the chance to vote for the type of postcards they want to receive. My patrons are my lifeblood, and I want to make sure they are well cared for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
