    "summary": "Hi, my name is Tom and I run After Image Studios in Scranton Pa. We do music covers on youtube where I record, mix, master, film and edit the videos myself. The studio offers recordings for bands, vocalist`s as well as video work.\u003cbr\u003eI have been getting a lot of great feedback on our covers, and discovered the patreon site through a fellow youtuber. I thought that this would be a great way to get my fans to connect and support what i\u00b4m doing so I can keep on doing these songs/videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo your pledges will allow me to do three things! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) To be able to invest and keep up with all the right tools for future artist`s coming in to record .Also i get so many people telling me \"i wish i can come into record but i just don`t have the money\" hey i get it,everyone has bills to pay,and i have sank so much money into my studio,to where someday i can do this full time. So with your help we can get a few artist`s in to pay for studio time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy jobs here :  I\u0027m personally responsible for , shooting, editing, color correcting, recording, engineering, mixing, mastering and releasing. So...your support helps me do all of these jobs. I\u0027m kind of like the CEO, and cleaning personal,and secretary of After Image Studio`s . We have my other partner`s/engineer`s Derek, and John to help us out...which is awesome, and then hopefully you guys can help support them too. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) You support will help grow my career as a social media artist. Growth takes investment and risk. Your an investor !!!! SWEETTTTT\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e3) Your support will allow me to mentor young artists and help them become self-sustaining brands. (artists in the past: Ellie,Brotality,Diane.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are in this together!  So whether you\u0027re backing me for a dollar or $1,000,000,.00 (ohhhh yeahhh - one million) I am so thankful you\u0027re here!!!
