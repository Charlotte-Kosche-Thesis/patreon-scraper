    "summary": "If you like to paint without having the slightest technical notion of painting, then follow me. I started in 2005 having absolutely no idea what I was doing, I simply had the courage to screw up and start again. I also had the luck to stumble upon the right materials, those which I resonated with. Painting technical stuff isn\u0027t my thing, but colors and matter are what turn me on. I created a style of my own, using sand, pigments, and then mixed oil and water based paintings so the result would be pretty (some might even say \u0027beautiful\u0027). Doing things this way isn\u0027t easy because oil and water repel as we know. I manage to keep enough pigments on the canvas for my painting to look like one. I work on a flat surface. I also use sand, and sometimes clay, also gypsum.\u00a0 Painting takes my thoughts away from other, more worrying thoughts. My painting becomes a form of meditation.\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out most of what I\u0027ve done since 2006 on my website marioguerrafineart.com.\u00a0 Or you can also buy one of the books I\u0027ve created for you on Blurb.com, click here \u003ca href=\"http://www.blurb.com/b/7879178-flying-upwards\"\u003ehttp://www.blurb.com/b/7879178-flying-upwards\u003c/a\u003e or here http://www.blurb.com/b/6004652-m-huru-paintings-2006-2014\u003cbr\u003eOr else you can order directly from my website here: \u003ca href=\"http://marioguerra.artstorefronts.com/art-photo-books\"\u003ehttp://marioguerra.artstorefronts.com/art-photo-b...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/i7ozikp2akhev3j/art%20photo%20books.tiff?dl=0\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XvDmliHzGX0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs already mentioned, I flow stuff onto a flat surface, canvas, wood, metal,.. - and, using my hands, individual fingers, I direct the flow of the liquids in the way I want, until I get a result I want.

     "about": "My journey towards my artistic self began in 2005. My then-wife encouraged me against my will and beliefs to start dabbling with colors, first pastels then acrylics and finally oils and natural pigments. It didn\u0027t take a lot of convincing for me to believe that I could indeed have fun with painting and at the same time create some original stuff. After trying various styles, I discovered my own based on a technique I simply call \u0027flowing\u0027: flowing technique simply involves literally flowing material, by definition liquids of various densities, colors and compositions, onto wood, paper or canvas. This way of painting makes it easy for me to escape from an otherwise busy mind, while testing and experimenting what works and what doesn\u0027t. \u003cbr\u003eAbout me: I\u0027m a self-taught artist and I\u0027ve been creating my own stuff since 2005. I\u0027ve exhibited mainly in Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg, and I\u0027m ready to go further abroad too. I hope you\u0027ll like what I do and that you\u0027ll be able to continue giving your monthly support, allowing me to go on creating, showing and selling what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
