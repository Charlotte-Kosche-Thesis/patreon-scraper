A lot of my musician friends use this service, and I thought I would try it out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery week, I will conclude my weekly stream of live videos with one original song, professionally done. I truly think it is important to not get lost in this industry, and to keep writing. I didn\u0027t write for a while, and came back as a much weaker songwriter. This will keep me writing, and will produce one new original song every week, with a video. I will try my best to not write bad songs, but it might happen. Could be fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have prizes available, that any one of you can pledge towards, per video.

If enough people do this, maybe I can start to invest more into each week, allowing better quality original music. I feel like the songs will change a lot depending on seasons, bad weeks, great weeks, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, this might not work out and I might delete it, but I thought I would give it a try!
