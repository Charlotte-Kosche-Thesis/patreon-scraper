    "summary": "-FIRST, A QUICK INTRO- \u003cbr\u003eHi! We\u0027re \"Art \u0026amp; Homesteading\" (actually, we\u0027re Trent \u0026amp; Lorajean Gudmundsen, and our kids: Lizzy, Alex, Everett, \"Banjo\", and Emmy), but the \nname of\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfNgFbgIS-82iB_kYYJOUMQ\"\u003e our vlog on YouTube\u003c/a\u003e also describes how we spend most of our time).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTrent\n is a professional artist specializing in oil paintings, and we are \nbuilding our own house and homestead. We are always creating art and \ntrying to build up the old-time artistic virtues and self-sufficiency of\n our homestead, all without going into debt of any kind (basically, that\n means that a lot of projects might get put on hold for a long time \nuntil we have the funds to buy the materials).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-WHY WE\u0027RE ON PATREON?-\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a site that allows you to support creators like us for our efforts...In our situation, it takes a LOT of time for us to record, edit, and post our videos about our daily lives on our homestead. We love to document and share what we\u0027re doing, but the large amount of time it takes (for surprisingly little pay via Youtube commercials) is often difficult to justify. Think of us as being similar to \"public television\". We mostly operate on support from \"viewers like you\". haha. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here on Patreon allows us to continue making frequent videos...plus, HERE you get EXTRA stuff!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-WHAT WE SHARE ON PATREON-\u003cbr\u003eHere you\u0027ll find our frequent Vlog episodes (for free, no pledge needed) as well as a variety of cool thank you gifts and extra videos available only\n to our patrons here on Patreon. (Different pledge amounts get access to different rewards.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-EVEN MORE-\u003cbr\u003eAnother way of supporting our family\u0027s ongoing projects, (and getting valuable stuff in return), is to purchase\u003cstrong\u003e prints\u003c/strong\u003e or \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal oil paintings\u003c/strong\u003e available on Trent\u0027s website \u003ca href=\"http://trentgudmundsen.com\"\u003etrentgudmundsen.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little donation adds up, and is greatly appreciated. If you love our videos, consider making a contribution. If you aren\u0027t currently in a position to pledge a donation, please enjoy for free right now, and perhaps consider donating some small next month. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany thanks!!!\u003cbr\u003e-Trent \u0026amp; Lorajean Gudmundsen (Art \u0026amp; Homesteading)\u003cbr\u003e"

For the past 4 years we\u0027ve been building our house from scratch with our own hands, and are only buying the materials as we can afford them. We also make and post new videos about our farm and projects 6 days a week on Youtube. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly, we\u0027re not in any \"dire financial straits\", but we\u0027re not rich by any stretch of the imagination either. We just live simply, and within our means. Basically, we have everything we need...but sometimes projects take awhile to save up money for. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If you\u0027d enjoy supporting us in our efforts to make the videos (or to make quicker progress on our projects), we would be very grateful for your contribution. If not, no big deal. We\u0027re just glad to provide fun and interesting videos for you and others to enjoy. Thanks for stopping by! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Trent \u0026amp; Lorajean and kids (Art \u0026amp; Homesteading)\u003cbr\u003e",
