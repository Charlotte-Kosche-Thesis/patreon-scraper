    "summary": "Hey there! I\u2019m Ben \u2013 a pastel artist living in Cambridge, MA. Although I study Computer Science at MIT and enjoy programming apps, games, and other software, my biggest passion has always been drawing. I\u0027m a big believer that art and engineering are complementary, rather than conflicting interests. Soft pastels have been my medium of choice for the past 10 years. I love to draw scenes with rich gradients of color and strong geometric patterns. I often simplify my subject matter to focus on beautiful colors and structures, but at times I apply a photorealistic effect when it best captures the beauty of an object.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/zgBlDud.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eTwo problems prevent me from drawing more often. First, finding time to consistently draw and paint can be tough since I\u2019m a full time student. Second, quality art supplies are expensive \u2013 constantly resupplying and investing in better pastels and canvases makes drawing an expensive hobby.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support solves both problems. You make it easier for me to prioritize making art in my free time. You also help offset the cost of my art supplies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/qE9cRl7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I have a public gallery of my work at \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/artbyben\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efacebook.com/artbyben\u003c/a\u003e, I usually only post finished works of art there. This Patreon page is a way for me to share the full creative process with my supporters. When I post a drawing, I\u2019ll show you the art behind the art \u2013 sketches, color palettes, step-by-step images of in-progress drawings, as well as high-resolution images you can download as wallpapers or to print for personal use.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XV7k83e.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/90RuWD2.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith more support, I hope to invest in even better art supplies, including softer pastels (I\u0027m dreaming of getting some Senneliers and Unisons), a set of oil paints (Winsor \u0026amp; Newton), and larger canvases. I also hope to produce time-lapse videos of the creation process for your enjoyment and education. I may even have the resources to publish an ebook for my supporters with an extensive collection of curated artwork and behind-the-scenes processes. You\u2019ll also be the first community I go to when asking for inspiration for future work, and you\u2019ll be the first to know if any original pieces go on sale. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow this works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou \u003cstrong\u003echoose an amount\u003c/strong\u003e to donate for each high-quality finished work I produce.
