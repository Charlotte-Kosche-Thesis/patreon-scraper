What is a Play Vicious? It\u2019s what I would be asking too. If someone just put those words together at random, I would\u2026 you know what. Let\u2019s just get to the point. That\u2019s why you\u2019re here, right? READ ON.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe What\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAt its core, PV is a place where creative culture is showcased, discussed and celebrated by folks who appreciate the process of creating good work. It\u2019s a place where we give props to the person who wrote the song, not just who performed it. It\u2019s a place where we give some shine to the people that toiled long and hard to write that favorite scene of the movie you\u2019re bothered more people aren\u2019t seeing. It\u2019s a place where story board art matters just as much as the finished video game product.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlay Vicious is a place that will explore the innumerable acts of creative brilliance that happen every day that often go unnoticed. It will be a place that will connect all of us that simply love culture and the work that goes into creating it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we\u2019re going to build it together.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe Why\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuilding such a place is as ambitious as it is necessary. If you\u2019re an online denizen as I am, we are often bombarded by sensationalist headlines and hyperbolic, and often ridiculous, stories that do a disservice not only to creative work that is being produced, but the people that produce it. PV intends to be a place that explores independent creative culture without all the fluff. A place that eschews absurdity to focus on the details of not only what we like, but how it came to be in the first place.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s what Play Vicious is. A place where people who are interested in the unseen as much as the seen can explore, collaborate and share without distraction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, building such a place is, obviously, going to take some work. I built a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://version-three.playvicio.us\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eproof of concept\u003c/a\u003e previously but, admittedly, realized the need was much bigger than I anticipated. Hence the need for a full on re-launch that can better accommodate a platform that focuses on the sundry creative works that we all dig.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://version-three.playvicio.us/screens/pv-01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://version-three.playvicio.us/screens/pv-02.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://version-three.playvicio.us/screens/pv-03.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://version-three.playvicio.us/screens/pv-04.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://version-three.playvicio.us/screens/pv-05.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many avenues by which such a project can be funded and sustained, but as I am a person that is adverse to seeking support from those that would only want to exploit creativity, I aim for support from people that love culture as much as I do. I want to build a place that is enjoyed and supported by like-minded people who like to dive deep into creative culture as much as I do without all the distractions that usually come with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe How\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlay Vicious will consist of four major components:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Everyday\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis area will be a daily update chock full of creative acts that have caught our attention.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFeatures\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are some pieces that will demand a deeper exploration and that will happen here. Sometimes it will be in the shape of a long form writing piece, or an audio interview or even a quick video that showcases why we like it. No matter what form a Feature takes, this is where the critical analysis and exploration will come into play.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eOriginal Programming\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nPlay Vicious will be deeply invested in exploring creativity and the culture that surrounds it, but also making its own contributions as well. We will produce content (short films, podcasts, creative tutorials) that will highlight specific areas, whether it be music, books, games, or some weird mix of it all that will just be fun to consume.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eStore\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA big part of Play Vicious will also be to provide a place where independent creators can sell and distribute their work without having to get shafted to have their work online. I am a big believer in the people that produce the content we love benefitting from that. The store at PV aims to ensure that proceeds gained from selling creators\u2019 work will actually get to the creators themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eIn Closing\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that you have the whole picture - who, what and why - I hope that gives you a clear view of the platform that I am building. It is my hope that you, dear reader, will support this idea so that there can be a place on the web that actually focuses on the creative work and not the sensationalizing of it. And together, we can make it a place that sustains and grows, completely independent of anything that has come before it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. And for the lovely people that want to support by giving a one-time contribution,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/Are0h\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ego here\u003c/a\u003e."
