    "summary": "FOR THE MONTH OF MAY MAKE A MONTHLY COMMITMENT OF $15 AND RECEIVE THE ALPHA BOYS SCHOOL RADIO TEE SHIRT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlpha Boys School Radio (ABSR) was founded in 2013 by Alpha Boys School, a non-profit vocational school in Kingston, Jamaica. ABSR was created to a) increase awareness about the school\u0027s rich musical legacy, b) create vocational training for Alpha students and c) generate new ways to support Alpha\u0027s vocational, educational and social programs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlpha offers a social safety net for students in immediate need of employment training, social support and educational development. Students attend school for free or their tuition is subsidized by the Religious Sisters of Mercy, a catholic order of nuns who have been running Alpha since 1890.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLaunched with the support of WXGR 105.3/Gritty, LLC, a 501c3 non-profit in the USA founded by Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker Michael Wadleigh, Alpha Boys School Radio built a radio production studio on campus with proceeds from a Rototom Sunsplash grant and a Kickstarter campaign. Every song on the radio features at least 1 past student on the track. ABSR now broadcasts to 50,000 listeners per month and Alpha students are helping produce original content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first radio program and podcast is called \"The Ask Sparrow Martin Show\" hosted by Sparrow Martin, a past Alpha student, bandmaster and former drummer for Bob Marley. Sparrow takes questions from around the world about Jamaican music, culture and of course Alpha Boys School and picks one to answer the first Friday of the month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to involve more students, create jobs and make the show a weekly broadcast. We need your help.\u003cbr\u003e"
