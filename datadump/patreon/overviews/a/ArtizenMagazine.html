    "summary": "Hello, my name is Cindy Marks and I\u2019m the creator behind \u003cem\u003eArtizen Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, a digital-only magazine that highlights the global artisan scene. Thank you so much for taking a look at what I\u0027m doing each month! \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy goal is to provide you with a gorgeous and inspiring lookbook/read each month as well as an easy and direct opportunity to contribute to the handcrafted, artisan community. You can participate both by interacting within the monthly magazine content I curate AND choosing here among my optional Reward Tiers, several of which pay it back to the artists.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I say I\u0027m the creator behind Artizen that means that I discover, interview, write, edit, publish, link and social media the crap out of things that are unique, high quality and the results of creative passion. While I\u2019ve dabbled myself in lots of artistic fun, truly I reserve all my awe and respect for those who focus on that passion, get their hands dirty each day, and fine-tune their craft into masterpieces. My mission with \u003cem\u003eArtizen Magazine\u003c/em\u003e is to give as much coverage to the these creatives as possible and to give my readers an eclectic variety of beautiful things to perhaps purchase, but also just look at and learn about each month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://artizenmagazine.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTake a peek at my past issues HERE!\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see, I tried producing Artizen for almost 5 years and then I made the decision to stop for a while. Basically, I just didn\u2019t have the personality for selling advertising (I\u2019d begrudgingly wear that hat now and again with some small result, but\u2026) and in the past, advertising was the only venue to keep alive free content. I want to keep the digital magazine easily distributed online and yet, still support my work and my family. My costs include hosting for the website, email costs to send it to everyone, and my own labor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, it\u2019s haunted me to NOT produce this magazine. I\u2019m always finding gorgeous things and creative ideas that I want (need?) to shout about. Artizen has a great following on social media and so now, with the urging of some fans, I\u2019m jumping in once again, to try publishing with Patreon. Any amount you choose to give will help keep the artisan love flowing and the content itself free to distribute. I\u2019ve created lots of tier options and within them, I\u2019ve tried to \"share it forward\" and keep this about the makers and creators. I\u2019m looking forward to helping some patron-selected artisans with design work or technology help. I\u2019m incredibly grateful to any patrons who support Artizen, thus allowing me the freedom to give back to artists.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are articles, videos, audio and lots of shopping links in an issue of Artizen. These provide numerous ways to directly buy from or connect with the artist. It\u2019s a curated gallery that changes every month. I HAVE happily heard from artists who said \u201cI wondered why I was suddenly getting all these clicks!\u201d and then their highlighted piece sold. That is why I do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for your help! \u003c/strong\u003eIf I can make it to over $4K per month then I will joyfully be inviting other paid writers/creative sleuths to follow unbeaten paths and chat with artisans about what they do, why they do it and how they do it. With more writers, there will be even more direct contact with artisans and even more diversity in the content. I look forward to bringing all this into your own home each month in an interactive fun read. And in between issues, I\u2019ll be doing some Patreon-only posting to my community here. (Secret tip: I LOVE creating Collections of objects with links for shopping. I suspect that will be even more fun for this community.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Contribute?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I\u0027m always pleased to get one-time donations, I love the Patreon model that enables a monthly snapshot of what will currently be my budget for the magazine. Patreon is a simple way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them directly for creating and contributing the content you value on the internet. In my particular case, the content will be a free digital magazine, the link to which I email directly to all my subscribers (both within and outside of Patreon.) Once you click my \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d button, you can choose the amount you feel comfortable with and enjoy goodies you can receive for each level. For example, if you choose $4 per month, then your credit card gets charged that amount on the 1st of each month. Put all together, this means Artizen Magazine will give me some regular return every month, and you become a bonafide Patron of the Arts. It\u2019s a system that has been up for a good while, I trust it and it seems to be working very well for both the Patrons and the creatives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can manage, change or quit your pledge at any time, and I will be grateful for whatever you could give. I\u2019m constantly finding more breathtaking content than I can possibly publish each month, and will be posting some \u201cexclusives\" to my Patreon followers here - shorter highlights that are likely even sneak peeks at upcoming artisans that we\u2019ll be hoping to interview.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a Patreon member today and specifically become an Artizen Patron - check that box and support the arts!"
