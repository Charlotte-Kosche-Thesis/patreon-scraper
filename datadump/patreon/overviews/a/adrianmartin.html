    "summary": "I have a project\nthat was publicly released online, for open access, on 26 July 2017: my website \u003cem\u003eFilm Critic: Adrian Martin\u003c/em\u003e (http://www.filmcritic.com.au) It is, essentially, a collection of my\nfilm reviews and short essays written over a period of almost 40 years, in many different styles\nand originally for many sorts of publications and occasions (newspapers, radio,\nspecialist magazines, unpublished notes, online journals, classroom handouts, etc)\nin many countries of the world. In fact, I have been working on this website,\non and off with various collaborators, for about 20 of those 40 years. It\ncurrently contains over 2,000 reviews, but there are at least 1,000 more that\nare ready to be entered into the site. In its tone and ambition, the project\ncould be compared to Jonathan Rosenbaum\u2019s website of his critical writings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWho am I?\nSome people reading this will be familiar my work as a film critic, or perhaps\nsome part of my varied career. I lived and worked (as a writer and teacher) in\nAustralia until the end of 2012. I began writing and researching about film in my teens, and\nfirst appeared in print at age 19, in a 1979 issue of \u003cem\u003eCinema Papers\u003c/em\u003e magazine. During the 1980s and 1990s I wrote, mainly,\nfor many Australian magazines (most of these, especially from the pre-digital\nera, very hard to access now), covering cinema, art, pop culture, sometimes\nmusic or literature; but I also began to appear beyond Australia in places like\n\u003cem\u003eSight and Sound\u003c/em\u003e (UK), \u003cem\u003eFilm Comment\u003c/em\u003e (USA) and \u003cem\u003eTrafic\u003c/em\u003e (France). From my teenage days, I have always tried to combine the evaluation of individual films with a consideration of larger contexts and ideas.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBetween\n1995 and 2006 I was one of the film reviewers on the Melbourne newspaper \u003cem\u003eThe Age\u003c/em\u003e and, from 1995 to 1997, I presented\n\u201cThe Week in Film\u201d on ABC Radio National. These last two media jobs alone are\nthe source of thousands of unpublished film review texts by me. Since the end\nof the 1990s, I have written a great deal for (sometimes ephemeral) Internet\nsites. I may also be known, to some of you, for my work providing around 50\naudio commentaries for DVD and Blu-ray releases of classic films from\nCriterion, Arrow, Olive, Masters of Cinema, the British Film Institute and\nMadman (Australia). Through all these years, I have diligently preserved and\ndigitised my original manuscripts of almost everything I have done, often\nlonger and more detailed than the published or broadcast versions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese days,\nliving in Europe, I am a freelancer; I no longer teach anywhere, and I have no\nregular, salaried \u2018gig\u2019 as a film reviewer. But I am still very much involved\nwith film criticism and film culture. As anyone who leads a freelance life well\nknows, the top priority is always the next looming deadline, and the next\nhopeful payment. It is increasingly difficult for me to devote time to pure\n\u2018labour of love\u2019 projects \u2013 and that is why I have always had to put off releasing\nthis website, until now.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo this is\nwhat I seek your help and support for, via Patreon: not to initially build the website (that\nhas already been done, thanks to my faithful, tireless Webmaster, the\nAustralian filmmaker Bill Mousoulis) but to\nmaintain it on a regular basis, and continually add to it, not only with old\npieces, but new ones as well. For that, I need some time and energy that will\nnot be a \u2018waste\u2019; I need the website itself to be a help in earning a (very)\nmodest, freelance living. For this support via Patreon, I am offering exclusive Rewards that comprise 5 books in PDF form, ranging from 85 to 95 pages each, featuring long essays (written between 1981 and now) by me that are either unpublished, or extremely hard to access in print (and which will not be ever included on the website itself), on topics ranging from cinephilia and film criticism to surrealism and film theory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut also note: below the threshold of the first Reward, you can simply contribute anything from $1 to $19 per month, just to support this ongoing project - click BECOME A PATRON to see this option listed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am therefore\nasking you to support the ongoing future of the \u003cem\u003eFilm Critic: Adrian Martin\u003c/em\u003e website \u2013 and the ongoing future of this\nparticular film critic, Adrian Martin, talking to you right now!"
