    "summary": "Active Capture started humbly on February 12th, 2017 when I got bored and decided to make a video about taking analog photos on traditional film. I wasn\u0027t really trying to start a YouTube channel, in fact I almost just uploaded the final product to my personal channel to be forgotten. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few people told me that the content would make for a great channel. I brushed off their suggestions at first but eventually caved. That short video ended up becoming episode #1 of Active Capture. Now the channel is bigger than I could have ever imagined at over 1000 subscribers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re not film experts. We\u0027re not master photographers. We\u0027re just people, and we\u0027re here to show you anyone can get into photography, film or otherwise. Thanks for checking out our Patreon and helping to support our channel. Don\u0027t forget to subscribe to the channel on YouTube and let your friends know about it. I\u0027m glad you\u0027re here to come on this journey with us. It\u0027ll be a lot of fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLater.\u003cbr\u003e"
