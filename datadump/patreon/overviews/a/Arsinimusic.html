I guess it\u0027s easiest to just say I\u0027m a musician though. I am a rapper/singer/singer songwriter/pop/whatever else I feel like being at the time. I guess it\u0027s easiest to call me a rapper. I have been writing for about 10 years, and have been putting music online since about 2011. Since then, I have released over 100 songs, plenty of videos, and other seemingly random content. If you want to view or hear any of my content, this is most easily accessible by visiting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.arsinimusic.com/\"\u003eMy Website\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much work as I have put in, I don\u0027t even break even when it comes to paying to do what I want with music. By contributing whatever you are comfortable with every month, you are helping me to: make somewhat of a living for working so hard on music that I put my whole heart and mind to, afford luxuries of studio time and mixing and mastering of songs, and add money to budgets for music videos and promotion of music that I am releasing. Every little bit counts and would mean a lot to me!\u00a0"
