    "summary": "Hello and welcome to our Patreon Page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Nate Morrison. I\u0027m the founder of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.americandefence.us\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmerican Defence\u003c/a\u003e and I\u0027d like to tell you why I\u0027m using Patreon. If you\u0027re reading this, chances are you like what we\u0027re doing, you\u0027re intrigued, and you want more of it. That\u0027s great because I do too! There\u0027s just one problem. The fact is that American Defence has always been and continues to be a one man show. It\u0027s just me, some really big goals, a ton of knowledge, skill, and zero capital.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmerican Defence is very unique and what we are attempting to do is unique. It\u0027s never been done before. Our mission is threefold:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eDevelop a culture of civic \u0026amp; military excellence within body of The American People.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSupport and defend the U.S. Constitution, The People, local \u0026amp; state EMS, and the American Republic.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAct as the National Governing Body for the USA Military-Applied Sport League.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe accomplish these objectives via three programs:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eSmart Citizens\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFit To Fight\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFight To Win\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSurvive With Honor\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have no competition and more potential than you can shake a stick at. I\u0027ve put every penny I have and more into these projects but without a marketing budget and the equipment to produce better quality products, we simply cannot achieve our full potential. We have to grow and grow fast! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2017 is upon us and the time to act is now! If we\u0027re going to restore the republic, we need to make our big move in 2017. If we\u0027re going fight obesity and restore athleticism to the United States, we must act quickly. In order to break out of this cage we\u0027re turning to crowdsourcing through Patreon. Our current system and store simply doesn\u0027t generate the capital we need to cover our costs. The issue is simple, we have to expand and to expand we need more capital. Yes, we need money to grow and a lot of it. That\u0027s where you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WE\u0027LL USE THE MONEY FOR\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur initial goal is $5,000/month. That money plus the store income will be enough to keep American Defence and USA Military-Applied Sport going. Here are the items that require funding:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWEB HOSTING: \u003c/strong\u003eWe need a robust hosting plan to support the platforms we use and high spikes in traffic. The plans are extremely expensive when purchased on a monthly basis as they are now. Multi-year plans save 30-50% that can then be rolled into the other areas we need to improve on.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eONLINE SYSTEMS: \u003c/strong\u003eEverything is online, cloud based and subscription based. That\u0027s everything from MS Office to Adobe software, graphics software, our forums and so on. These subscriptions are the same as web hosting, expensive as hell on a monthly basis, downright affordable if you have the funds for multi-year subscriptions.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEQUIPMENT UPGRADES:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m currently using a 2008 iMac computer on it\u0027s very last leg. I desperately need to upgrade the computer, data storage devices and so on. I also need to purchase new cameras, microphones, software, etc. I went through a very messy break up and my ex stole my cameras, passport and other items. With new computers, cameras, microphones and software we can start creating the type of content we always dreamed about instead of using an iPhone 5 and a nine year old computer. These upgrades alone will cost $15-20K.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMARKETING: \u003c/strong\u003eOh the things I could do with Facebook Ads alone! The days of Guerilla Marketing are over. Everyone wised up and fixed the glitches. Now you have to pay for everything to include how many social media followers will actually see your posts. It\u0027s backed folks like us into a corner that only money can get you out of. A couple hundred dollars a month in Facebook and Google ads would do wonders for our ability to attract new customers.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOURS TRULY:\u003c/strong\u003e I need to start eating and training again. I\u0027m literally living in a shack in the north woods of Vermont eating soup and crackers most days. If I\u0027m ever going to run this company the way it needs to be run, I need to be healthy and fit. I also need to get out of Northern Vermont and back to Colorado Springs, CO where I belong (bad break up, it\u0027s a long story to be told over beer) so that we can partner with a couple of companies who want to work with us, if and when I get back there. I\u0027m a single man, my son is grown, my needs are few. Moving is expensive.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCUSTOMER SERVICE:\u003c/strong\u003e As a one man show I face a daily battle. I can spend half the day on customer service issues, or I can work on new projects in an attempt to keep the lights on. Guess which one wins? And that\u0027s not fair to our customers! I would love to hire a small business or an individual to handle our daily customer service needs, or, take the heat off of me for a bit so I can address our customer\u0027s questions.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAPPAREL: \u003c/strong\u003eSpeaking of customer service, our customers have been screaming for apparel and swag for years. I\u0027ve never been able to put it together. An influx of capital would allow us to finally start marketing through branded apparel.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUILD USA MILITARY-APPLIED SPORT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0By the time I\u0027m done, USA Military-Applied Sport will rival the US Olympic Committee. Building this organization will take years of effort, millions of dollars, but most importantly, it will take the support of people like you to become athletes, club owners, state and regional directors. We need to start hosting events as soon as possible and we need to spread the word to attract large corporate partners. Any funds we have left over will be used to promote and build the USA Military-Applied Sport League.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e"

     "about": "In 2013 RIKR Defence was launched to bring a new level of combat performance excellence to the armed forces and armed professional communities. Our core concern is the complete disconnect between physical fitness training, combat skills training and the lack of realistic practice in the development of soldiers and special operators. RIKR Defence is the only entity in the Western world to create a holistic development model for the soldier that mirrors that of an Olympic athlete and ancient warriors. Over the last several years we have begun a quiet revolution as armed professionals worldwide use our training methods to discover levels of performance they never knew existed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to a holistic and unified system of training, we believe it is essential to choose equipment and TTPs that enhance combat performance while minimizing the impact to the soldier and the national treasury. We subject equipment, clothing, and TTPs to rigorous and scientific evaluation to determine the net impact on performance, effectiveness, safety and health. This is done both on an individual basis and through the crucible that is military-applied sport. Equipment and TTPs with a net-positive are approved and promoted. Net-neutral is approved but discouraged. Net-negative is actively opposed. In this way, we hope to positively influence industry and policy for the betterment of the soldier and operator. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArmed with a superior combat training system, an honorable mission and a bold vision, RIKR Defence provides a wide variety of training products and services to those seeking the highest levels of performance in combat and military-appled sport.",
