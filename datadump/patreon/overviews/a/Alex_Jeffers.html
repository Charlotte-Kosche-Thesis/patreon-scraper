These days mostly at the magical-fantastical end of the literary spectrum, though I started out with science fiction and did the lit-fic thing for quite a few years. I, uh, don\u2019t like to repeat myself.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI expect nine out of ten people who land here already know my name and have read something of mine. For the one out of ten who arrives out of sheer serendipity: Hey! Nicetameetcha!

Fiction things\u2014the kind I write, anyway, and at the rate I write them\u2014don\u2019t pay very much. For just a bunch of reasons, my other sources of income are pretty spotty as well. Plus I had two lengthy episodes of bad health the last couple years that really interfered with making a living. Along with making me miserable and grumpy. Which, honestly, I am a lot of the time anyway, partly because I\u2019m naturally cranky but more because my income, besides being low, is unpredictable and inconsistent.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s where you and Patreon can help me out! Not so much with the lowness. I\u2019m not greedy and don\u2019t have any illusions about you nice people buying me, like, a car. What would I do with a car? But consistency. Consistency would be such a relief.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo that\u0027s what I\u0027ll get out of this and it\u0027s not terribly interesting.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLet\u2019s talk rewards: rewards for you. They\u2019re over there in the sidebar but I want to expand on them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n1. For a\u00a0 $2/month pledge you\u0027ll get stories\u2014a haphazardly curated selection of stories that don\u0027t appear in either of my collections and aren\u0027t available elsewhere online. I\u0027ll post one in the patrons-only area of the blog on the first of every month, along with a couple of words about it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n2. At the $5 level, in addition to access to the $2 stories, you\u0027ll receive by e-mail one chapter every week from the current draft of \n\u003cem\u003eThe Young God\u2019s Nephew\u003c/em\u003e, a hefty long YA fantasy novel. (Let me know whether you prefer a Microsoft Word file or a PDF.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat\u2019s \n\u003cem\u003eYGN\u003c/em\u003e about? Here\u2019s the two-hundred-word elevator pitch:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eNate Walker never expected to fist-fight with gods the summer he turned sixteen. To win, pretty much. Even though gods never fight fair.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHe knew all about gods, sure, or thought he did. His uncle\u2019s husband, an exiled royal, helped bring Nate up in the ancient faith of the fifth-smallest sovereign nation in Europe. His best friend had been telling him magical stories of the Afro-Brazilian orix\u00e1s forever. The two pantheons weren\u2019t meant to collide or collude, though. Not at home in Wixam, Massachusetts, and not in the Serene Principality of Mxhet. Gods weren\u2019t meant to try to rape Nate\u2019s boyfriend.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNate knew about magic, too. His uncle\u2019s husband was a wizard. It came with the blood, with being a Sotic aristocrat of Mxhet. What nobody\u2019d got around to telling Nate was he had Sotic blood himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNate\u2019s trip to Mxhet with his uncles was supposed to be just a summer vacation. It would turn into a battle for the soul of the ancient principality, and Nate into an ambivalent hero\u2014a wizard, a reluctant killer\u2014when all he really wanted was to snuggle with his boyfriend and figure out if they had a future together.\n\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the same e-mail with the final chapter will be a copy of the complete MS (again, your choice of Word or PDF) for rereading convenience. If/when \n\u003cem\u003eYGN\u003c/em\u003e is published, your name will feature in the acknowledgments\u2014unless you\u0027d prefer it didn\u0027t!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n3. The reward levels are cumulative so $10 supporters will see the monthly stories, a weekly chapter of \n\u003cem\u003eYGN\u003c/em\u003e until they run out and, every other week, a draft chapter from the novel I\u2019m writing right now. Which doesn\u2019t have a title yet. I hate when that happens. Because the document on my hard drive needs a file name, and simply for convenience, I\u2019ve given it the working title \u003cem\u003e[Fide and Ggau]\u003c/em\u003e after the main characters.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(If you care, the first is two syllables, FEE-day. The first g of Ggau is very slightly nasalized and there\u2019s the tiniest hesitation that isn\u2019t quite a vowel before the second hard-g: ng-GOW, kinda. It\u2019s short for Kholtenggau.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI expect that parenthetical paragraph demonstrates right off that \n\u003cem\u003e[Fide and Ggau]\u003c/em\u003e takes place in an imaginary world, not today\u2019s USA, and that Fide and Ggau themselves don\u2019t speak English as a first language.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo what\u2019s it about, this secondary-world fantasy novel, and who are Fide and Ggau?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOh, a disclaimer first. Or a warning? By no means entirely, but significantly, \n\u003cem\u003e[Fide and Ggau]\u003c/em\u003e is a work of erotica as well as whatever all else it is. Gay male erotica. Ulp. But I did win a Lambda Award for gay smut so maybe I know what I\u0027m doing? And really truly honestly the sexy bits aren\u2019t simply put-your-hand-down-your-pants material, they\u2019re psychologically revealing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe novel that will not be titled \n\u003cem\u003e[Fide and Ggau]\u003c/em\u003e if I have anything to say about it is an adventure fantasy (with gay sex) (and gay romance) set in a pre-industrial world of many small realms where magic is real, both everyday witchery and grand, earth-changing sorcery.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFide is the younger brother and heir presumptive of the ruler of one of those small kingdoms, Vorsest. But when Vors XX fathers a son, an heir of his body, Fide becomes expendable and a liability and, following ancient tradition, his elder brother sends a pack of shape-changing human-mastiff assassins to kill him. Will Fide, in magical disguise as a harmless scholar from the Far West, escape brutal death to flee across the sorcery-engineered Fruiting Bridge to temporary sanctuary in the neighboring realm of Grb?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMeanwhile, wandering swordsman-with-a-secret Ggau visits Vorsest\u2019s capital in search of aid in his self-imposed mission to kill an evil sorcerer. Not by accident, he encounters a soothsayer who happens to be a distant cousin. Ggau\u2019s grandfather and the soothsayer himself were both younger siblings of the ruling line of Daewen, a mountainous realms north of Vorsest. For hundreds of years the monarchs of Daewen have been puppets of the powerful sorcerer who calls himself O. An oracle is delivered which hints Fide is the key to O\u2019s downfall but that Ggau must find him before he somehow loses himself.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWill Ggau be able to track down disguised Fide in Grb without much more clue than that he smells like flowers? Will they be able to break the enchantment that has Fide more than half-believing he\u2019s actually that wandering scholar from the distant empire of Akand? Will Ggau persuade Fide to join his quest to kill O\u2014can they figure out how to do it with no magic between them? Will there be adventures and wonders and sword fights and monsters and hot monkey-sex on the way to true love (and more monkey-sex)?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou betcha.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs with \n\u003cem\u003eYGN\u003c/em\u003e, the final e-mailed bit of \u003cem\u003e[Fide and Ggau]\u003c/em\u003e will be accompanied by a Word or PDF copy of the entire MS. Your name in the acknowledgments of a published version? Check.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n4.
