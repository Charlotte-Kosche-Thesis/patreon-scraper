    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi and thank you for clicking!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy pen name is Alana Melos, and I\u0027m a writer of unique erotica, ranging from the serious to the silly, from dark fantasy to science fiction, with a dabbling in contemporary and even romance. That being said, my writing is for mature audiences, audiences who want to see a story/plot, unique settings and worlds, and characterization with their sexy times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough all of my stories have sexy times in them, my main series--Villainess--is actually dark fantasy/science-fiction. It\u0027s about a villainess making her way in a world full of heroes, magic, mayhem, mutant plant monsters, werewolves, cyborgs, and so much more in a comic book-esque unique world. My second main series is Delilah Devilshot, which is erotica set in the Weird West, a setting which I absolutely adore, and in which absolutely anything can happen. Delilah sells her soul to a devil to gain power so she can take her revenge on the ruffians who killed her loved ones... and has many adventures along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy main thing is writing stuff \u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e want to read. It\u0027s not always popular, as it doesn\u0027t fit the current YA craze nor paranormal romance or urban fantasy, but it\u0027s different. Much of my inspiration comes from around me, from my interests in movies and literature, from comic books to games. Part of reason why I write erotic content even into my serious works is that sex is a part of life, and sometimes books are so sanitized. I do have short stories which are just about the sex (yet still do have plot elements and heavy characterization in them), but my longer works are all serious, and each word serves to build the plot, character, or setting... even the sexy ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wish for nothing more than to write and entertain people with sexy stories, thrilling adventures, dark villains, tragic heroes, absurd situations, and everything in between.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

She sincerely hopes to just entertain people, whether they read for the plot, the weird factor, or the racy factor. Along with her loving husband, she lives with two crazy cats.",

I see some creators saying \"Hey, this will pay my rent!\" and other such things. \u003cstrong\u003eThese goals are for US, you and me both.\u003c/strong\u003e I want cool stuff, and you want cool stuff. One of the things I would love to do is to have custom images created of some of the main characters in my two main series. I\u0027d want to do Capricious Whim, Caprice for short, first... especially since she IS a comic book character. With that, I would make a \u003cstrong\u003ecustom book cover for my patrons only\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0for The Queen of Swords. I plan on putting the patron money aside until it\u0027s affordable, and then commissioning the art and having Jotham turn it into a custom book cover (BOTH paperback and ebook versions!) when I reach a total of $50 a month here.",
