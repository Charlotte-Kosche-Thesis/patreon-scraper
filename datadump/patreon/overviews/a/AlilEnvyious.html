My name is Laura Jean, though online I\u0027ve been going by Envyious or Envy. I live near London, about an 1 hour away having moved down here 4 years ago from the Midlands. I\u0027m a massive video game addict, I used to be a hardcore raider on WoW, spent far too many hours on League of Legends and poured endless evenings into Elderscrolls and Dragon age, when I\u0027m not watching anime of course.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was introduced to cosplay just over 2 years ago now by an old college friend, having seen her wearing various marvel costumes and posting them on Facebook.\u00a0She introduced me to cosplay, this new weird and wonderful hobby which I\u0027ve fallen head over heels for.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I made my first costume, classic Nidalee from league of legends out of my living room cushions, fur from a bed throw and a tree branch from the local park. I\u0027d never been to a convention, only heard about them in passing from friends and occasional internet posts. It felt like home, I got to combine my love for games, crafting and acting all in one. I got to bring my favourite characters to life while meeting a ton of people who all felt their same about their own games and characters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt pushed me out of my comfort zone, has made me more confident and has helped me battle my anxiety. When I first started my page\u00a0I chose the name Envyious because of my anxiety and depression, it was a reminder of the days when I was jealous of everyone happy. A reminder that I don\u0027t have to be jealous, I can be as happy as the people living their dreams, I\u0027ve just got to try and live mine. My inspirations for cosplay are Jessica Nigri, Enayla Cosplay and Danielle Beaulieu (Who also inspired this lay out for my patreon haha)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/QsSSshk.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why patreon! It\u0027s a good way for me to give a extra to my followers, a way we can benefit from each other. I spend a lot of my free time now creating costumes, all between full time work. Each costume can take anywhere from 3 to 4 weeks, to 5 or 6 months. My costumes range from $200 to $600, depending on materials and techniques used, I also occasionally buy and alter costumes when my time is pushed for simpler things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives me a chance to keep growing as a cosplayer, though I greatly appreciate all the support I get in any form, continually pushing myself harder to become so much better at my craft.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/S7MdClM.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll support I get greatly appreciate, Thank you very much for giving my patreon a look over, and following me in what ever way you do \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotos used are by: Catberry Photography, Demora Fairy Photography, Sonesh Joshi Photography, Kevin Pack and SiPhotos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLayout was inspired by Danielle Beaulieu\u0027s *Danielle Cosplay* Patron, please go give her a look!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eImages put together by DemoraFairy and her magic shop skills.
