Birt, the author of the epic fantasy series the Rise of the Fifth Order and Games of Fire as well the near-future dystopian series Friends of my Enemy, plus a couple of non-fiction books. But you don\u0027t have to believe me, you can check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.autumnwriting.com/my-books/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy books\u003c/a\u003e over on my blog. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI love writing. After four decades of searching, I\u0027ve finally found what I want to do when I grow up! Oh heck, why wait to grow up, or wait at all. I\u0027m doing it now. Every day I write is a good day, and I try to write every day. That is how I\u0027ve written as much as I have, over four books a year at my best. I always have a story in my head and another nibbling away in my subconscious - at least one!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd the nice thing is, I\u0027m good at it too. Don\u0027t take my word for it, see for yourself by picking up a free book \u003ca href=\"http://www.autumnwriting.com/get-free-book\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.

The crazy thing is I was the bread winner of the family. But my husband and I were out of debt and I was so miserable at my full time job. I\u0027d basically stopped writing and was desperately working on side projects that would provide enough of a boost in income to allow me to leave my day job without begging on the streets. I wasn\u0027t there yet though.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut we took a risk, pooled our savings, decided to sell 90% of what we owned, and just did it. I quit. OMG, that was such a crazy day/decision/holy CRAP moment! I\u0027ll only give full details over beer. It was flat out nuts. If you want full details, head over to my overland blog, \u003ca href=\"http://www.escapewiththedog.com\"\u003eEscape with the Dog\u003c/a\u003e, to see if my husband and I are close to your local and let me know! If so, I\u0027d love to meet up and tell you all the insanity.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI did it anyway, so there might be something to the notion that all writers are crazy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI thought I\u0027d have more time to write. And I tried. But I felt the pressure to make those side projects work (someone had to provide income for food!) and threw myself into them. And wrote some, enough I finally finished my last book about six months behind schedule. I thought fans were going to lynch me!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, a year out from having left my full time job, I can say my savings is getting a lot lower, I\u0027m not writing as much as I\u0027d like, those side projects took up a lot of writing time without much income to speak of, and I\u0027m facing the idea of going back to a regular day job. That means giving up not only my dream of writing, but also our underlying desire to travel slow and see North America in the old Landcruiser we\u0027ve outfitted for travel. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://www.escapewiththedog.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Nemo-the-landroamer.jpg\" style=\"width: 439px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tNemo is named after our older Cairn terrier, who passed away last fall.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt is also now one of the few things I own other than my laptop!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nExcept I realized that the one project that I never really gave a chance was to simply write more. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nCall this my final effort to make it all work. My focus will be on producing awesome stories exclusively for you. If you like my writing, the \u003ca href=\"http://www.autumnwriting.com/the-world-of-myrrah/untold-stories/\"\u003eUntold Stories\u003c/a\u003e, or want early access to my next release, this is going to be a wonderful relationship for you! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.autumnwriting.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Join-Me.jpg\" style=\"width: 509px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tEpic walks inspire my writing, just like my fans.
