    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHeya!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m Ary, the performer and creator behind Rinn the Sergal. I\u0027ve been creating dance videos for several years now, and using this art of costumed dance to inspire people and spread a positive message. It all started as a simple outlet to share my passion which grew into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx1jv3oVMY8\"\u003edance tips\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca class=\"hoverZoomLink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0rLZ56Tn_a8\"\u003einspirational support\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca class=\"hoverZoomLink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_EyMAZBUFQ\"\u003esynchronized light shows\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca class=\"hoverZoomLink\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg1Ffu0W1yU\"\u003ejust silly fun\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile my channel and content has a large appeal to the furry community, I believe that the core values of self confidence, love, and improvement as a journey in life are universal to all of us and I\u0027ve personally met many of my followers who have told me that my videos have helped them, be it with stress, with learning to be unafraid to be themselves, to achieve their dreams, or just to smile from an entertaining short clip. I\u0027m asking for your support because together we can spread this same positivity, beauty, and art to even more people around the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s this Patreon thing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a site where people can donate money regularly each month directly to creators for the content they produce. It is a way for fans and audiences to give back, support, and directly help their favorite creators make the content that they make. It does not rely on advertisement, and therefore creators serve their viewers and not advertisers or corporate sponsors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? Why Ask for Money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am looking to you, my own fans for support to vastly expand the content I make for you and maybe even be able to live off it in the future. Largely, the videos I do on Youtube are automatically claimed by large recording companies. Not a single cent from the ads you see on my Youtube videos goes to me or towards helping produce the videos I make. Instead, that money goes to the record companies that own the music I dance to. It is a better alternative than having my videos removed, but this gives you a way to watch my content \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e support me directly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know your money is important to you and I will never charge for the kind of content I\u0027ve been making so far--those videos will still go up on Youtube for everyone, for free as always. However, as a patron, you will get to take part in helping grow my content and gain access to a lot of new videos, including exclusive ones released only to supporters. Some of the things your money may go to include keeping my equipment upgraded and up-to-date, travel costs so that I can come out and meet more of you and teach more workshops in person, and the ability to hire help to do larger, more complex videos. The possibilities are endless and you have my thanks for even just coming here and considering donating to me. I have wanted for some time to connect more directly to you and invite you to join me in my adventure!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked! For just $1 per month, you\u0027ll get\u00a0a monthly newsletter where I write about my own insights on dance and costuming, as well as a list of articles and videos on dance I think you\u0027d like in order to keep inspired, to help your training, highlight someone in our community, and things of that nature. You\u0027ll also get to see all of my blog posts here, updates, and other videos such as tutorials relating to what I do outside of dance like lighting, video editing, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor $3 per month, you will also get at least one exclusive video per month, as well as all of my deleted clips, which can sometimes be really silly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow at $5 per month, things kick into high gear: You get to join my \"Choreo Club,\" an exclusive club for patrons at this tier where I will teach you through videos, a new choreography every month and you\u0027ll be able to chat with me directly about it in order to keep on track. Learning choreography is one of the most effective ways to expand your movement vocab and improve your flow, so we can grow as dancers together. Most dance schools will charge at least $30/mo for this! In addition to that perk, you will be entered in a bi-monthly raffle to win a personalized dance video from me. I will give a special greeting to whomever you choose and then dance to any song of your choice in the video! Finally on top of all that, you also get early access to ALL of my videos, and your name will be listed in the credits of my public videos posted to Youtube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
