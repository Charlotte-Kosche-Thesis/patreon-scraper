    "summary": "These days a growing number of forms of internet advertising are invasive and irritating. \u00a0Many people turn to ad-blocking software to improve their viewing experience of webpages and videos. \u00a0Unfortunately for the content creator, this cuts into their livelihood by cutting off the lion\u0027s share of income from their content. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Arumba is using Patreon to allow viewers and subscribers to support him directly, allowing them complete absolution for using an ad-blocker while watching his videos. \u00a0Any pledge is worth more than the ad revenue that would be earned, so pledge, block ads, do what you want to do. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 So before you click off this page, I\u2019d like to just quickly give you something to consider when it comes to supporting the channel and how significant an impact you can make. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHere is my logical argument for why you should support the channel:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Let\u2019s say in any given month you have your income and your expenses. You budget hundreds, if not thousands of dollars for various things that you either need, or you want.  Let\u2019s say you like to go out to dinner, or you like to go to the movies, or you buy music or DVDs.  Whatever form of entertainment you enjoy, you spend money on it.  Let\u2019s use that movie goer\u2019s idea as an example.  The average movie ticket in the US (according to \u003ca href=\"http://natoonline.org/data/ticket-price/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://natoonline.org/data/ticket-price/\u003c/a\u003e) costs $7.96 per person as of the most recent data.  You pay ~$8 and you get 2 hours of entertainment, maybe 3 if you only go to the longest movies out there.  Then you pay $20 for popcorn and some soda.  And add another $8 for your date/spouse.  (And a god-awful amount if you happen to bring your kids).  So once per month you get entertained for 2 hours and it costs you somewhere between $8 if you went alone with no snacks, as as much as $8+$8+$20=$36 if you went on your average date night movie.  All for a meager 2 hours of entertainment.\nOn the other hand, I put out 8 videos per day, every single day, that vary between 15 minutes and 25 minutes in length.  Let\u2019s assume the shortest length for arguments sake and say 15 minutes x 8 video x 365 days per year = 43,800 minutes of entertainment per year.  /12 = 3,650 minutes per month.  /60 = 60.83 hours per month.  Now naturally, not everyone will watch every single video that goes up on the channel.  But if you even watch a *tenth* of the videos I make, you are getting over 6 hours of entertainment per month.  Is it as good as a movie?  Maybe. Probably not.  But is it worth *some* nominal value that is greater than $0?  Definitely. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0I hope to someday soon add special Patreon-only features, and I will likely look to YOU to help me decide what would be a suitable bonus for being a member of those that support the channel directly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 So you decide for yourself.  If you enjoy the content, if you find yourself waiting for the next video, or returning to the channel frequently, *and* you have the means to financially support it, please consider doing so.  Thanks for hearing me out, and whether you decide to support me on Patreon or not, I am very glad to have you as a part of the audience.  Thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nOh, and just in case you don\u2019t like logical arguments, let me give you one final emotional argument. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eDo it cause you like me.  I like you, you like me, that\u2019s good enough reason, right?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for supporting the channel, and keeping Arumba making videos for the internet.\u003cbr\u003e"
