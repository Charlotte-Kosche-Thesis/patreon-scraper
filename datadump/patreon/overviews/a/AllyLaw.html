The chances are you found this page through my Social media pages so you know who I am \u0026amp; What I do but for those that Don\u0027t know me, I\u0027m a 20 year old English dude who likes to go on adventures around the world \u0026amp; make video\u0027s on them to post to my Youtube channel. I had no real idea what I wanted to do with life until I came across the whole platform where I began sharing my adventures \u0026amp; Parkour/Climbing videos with the world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhats the deal?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nI\u0027ll get straight to the point. I\u0027ve got to the point where I need help... Last year I had been lucky enough to be able to support myself solely from Youtube ad Revenue \u0026amp; I was able to quit my day job (which I hated) \u0026amp; every second of it has been an absolute crazy ride for me, I was able to get paid to do what I loved, It was amazing! It was great but sadly for the past 6 months now my Channel has been stuck in \"the Youtube Ad crisis\" with the whole Youtube Algorithm changing which has resulted in ads not being shown to 90% of my viewers which means I\u0027ve lost 90% of the ad revenue, whereas for most channels, 1000 views would = \u00a31 \u0026amp; 1 Million views = \u00a31000 In the past 6 months my channel has received just over 6 million views which should = \u00a36000, Instead I have actually earned just under \u00a3550. It never really bothered me too much as I had some money to continue doing what I was doing \u0026amp; I thought it would get better, right? Sadly it hasn\u0027t got any better \u0026amp; I\u0027ve got to the point where I need to find an alternative to fund making these videos\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThis is where Patreon comes into it\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nFor you that don\u0027t know, Patreon works on a donation/reward system, Where you guys, can directly help to support my channel \u0026amp; content.\u00a0You are by no means whatever obliged to donate \u0026amp; If you can\u0027t donate that is completely fine but If you do think my content is worth something to you \u0026amp; you want to support what I am doing, \u00a0You can personally help support me \u0026amp; the video\u0027s by donating \u0026amp; you will get the rewards back depending on which reward you decide to go for! If you do decide to donate, even if its $1, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for keeping the dream alive \u0026lt;3\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat\u0027s next?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a bigger audience in the USA than anywhere so my plan for now is to stay in England for the summer, Climb some crazy things \u0026amp; go on some mad adventures with my friends \u0026amp; then once it hits winter, I wan\u0027t to start planning the biggest baddest USA roadtrip ever, Meeting up with tonnes of you guys along the way!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhere will this money go?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eAll the money I earn on Patreon, like all the money I earn anyway will be put into making my content better, It will pay for cheap flights to get to different countries, It will pay to upgrade my camera equipment, like getting a drone.
