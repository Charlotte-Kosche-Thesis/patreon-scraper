I sure do. I am a self-proclaimed horror enthusiast who loves to delve into all the things that go bump in the night. I love horror so much, I make my own little horror games, stream \u0026amp; play horror games constantly (with a goal to play and share as many as I can in my lifetime), analyze them, and poke fun of them constantly in my spare time.\u00a0You can call it my life passion.

Around 2008 I started making playthrough videos of video games on a group channel (which would later become known as Let\u0027s Plays), and in 2010, I finally made my own channel for it, AestheticGamer, which I have been running ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with this, since I was 10 years old, I started making little games in my spare time. For years, I didn\u0027t release any of them. Until one day in 2012, the popular Ludum Dare game creation jam had started going, and I made and submitted a small game there. I started to enter more jams, then experimented by expanding one of my jam games, and releasing it on Steam. I doodled up the sprites, made the music for it, and released it to a surprisingly solid response. I then dedicated time to improve myself, and to make these little horror games that I hoped others would enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gotten to a point in my life where I need to decide how to move forward to keep myself financially afloat. With increased financial responsibilities, how things are going currently isn\u0027t a steady way to be able to support myself. And so, I either need to make it a steady platform to support myself with, or I\u0027m going to have much less time to work on it as I focus on earning a living elsewhere, and keep it to something I do when I have the time to do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBottom-Line\u003c/strong\u003e: I would like to use Patreon to help me do this full-time, and be able to keep a consistent schedule of streams \u0026amp; videos coming out, maybe focus on higher-quality and more edited videos outside of let\u0027s plays (such as analysis of the horror medium, and silly game comedy skits), and to have time to work on and release my games more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate anyone who takes the time to even just try the games and videos I put out, and took a moment to look over the page. And of course, I am incredibly grateful for anyone who decides to donate to this Patreon to help support me to continue making these things for the masses. I hope to keep this a bit brief and not go long-winded as I usually do, but I hope that was informative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
