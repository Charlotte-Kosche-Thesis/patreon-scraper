Also known as Amanda to my friends and a few other choice names we won\u0027t repeat here. I am a founder and Executive Marketing Manager at Our Write Side, a company built by authors for authors. The drive behind OWS is helping authors to fulfill their writing dreams and connect with their readers without breaking the bank to do so. The talented staff at OWS volunteer their time to help with everything from editing to marketing and graphic art work. I am a multi-genre author myself, currently working on a fantasy trilogy and a dystopian series while dabbling in short stories, poetry, and prompt writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI dedicate my time to many different causes close to my heart, including mental health awareness, domestic abuse, child abuse awareness, and anti-bullying campaigns. I have an obsessive love of vampires, kilts, and blue butterflies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I am not writing, advocating or creating handmade items in my art studio, I can be found exploring creeks, mountains, and rivers, playing board games, videos games and working on various projects with my loving husband, Shawn and our beautiful blended family of 5 teenagers. (That was one really long run on sentence.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a whim I asked my friends how they would describe me, you can see their responses\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10212518296537299\u0026amp;set=a.1902804174697.2111377.1379510378\u0026amp;type=3\u0026amp;theater\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://authoralmabry.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWriting is my passion but it doesn\u0027t always provide a regular income. A full novel or a series takes a tremendous amount of time to produce and perfect. In order to keep my income steady and writing constant, I need to find a balance. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. This isn\u0027t a plea for donations, it is a chance to purchase quality stories and support an author you love (you *do* love me right?) This platform gives me the chance to share my work and buy my coffee!\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eIn addition to writing, I do a lot of my own graphic work (although I do have a fantastic graphic artist in my corner!) and I make videos on Youtube. There are costs involved in creating quality work, as any artist can tell you. I am hoping at the very least to offset those expenses. At the most, to avoid picking up a nine to five and severely limiting my writing time.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI can share short stories and other surprises with a dedicated audience here while also working on my bigger projects and continuing to help other authors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy default, your support here will also be supporting\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ourwriteside.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOur Write Side.\u003c/a\u003e I put everything I can into the OWS community as do my business partners.

I want you to come with me as we push the boundaries of pain and misfortune while exploring both sides of the coin. Some stories will come from the PoV of a victim and some from the aggressor. We will venture into many wilted fields filled with the carcasses of imagined abuses, losses, self-loathing, and wretchedness. Darkness touches each of us to different degrees throughout our lives and here we will witness it first hand.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eEach month I will share a short story that is slated to be published in Darker Daze: The Storms Within.
