    "summary": "Avaneya is a cerebral science fiction game set on Mars. If you enjoyed the game mechanics of SimCity and some of the artistic themes of Blade Runner, you will enjoy Avaneya. Avaneya will be released under the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html\"\u003eGPLv3\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAvaneya combines the perfect\nblend of the metropolis city builder social simulation and cooperative\nmultiplayer. Players creatively craft beautiful cities and watch as they\nform civic and cultural lives of their own driven by sophisticated artificial\nintelligence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most complex part of Avaneya is its underlying social simulation engine which can simulate inner city decay, gentrification, traffic flow, population density, crime, education, pollution, and more. Our simulation engine is currently under active development since it received the technical and financial support of the National Research Council of Canada in the Summer of 2017.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.avaneya.com/#!/store\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://www.avaneya.com/images/gallery/vlr/boxes.png\" style=\"width: 100px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003eIn late 2013 we announced that we had developed and released the technology to recover substantial quantities of NASA\u0027s previously inaccessible Viking mission data, subsequently \u003ca href=\"https://pds-imaging.jpl.nasa.gov/software/#Viking\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecited\u003c/a\u003e by NASA\u0027s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The historic \n    billion\u2013dollar mission to Mars was the most ambitious in history. Launched \n    in 1975, it was the first to successfully reach and photograph the surface \n    of the Red Planet. Originally intended as an internal research tool for our artists, public interest motivated its external release. Software DVDs were made available for purchase, but we sold out!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAvaneya is by no means a new project. It\u0027s already received many thousands of man hours.
