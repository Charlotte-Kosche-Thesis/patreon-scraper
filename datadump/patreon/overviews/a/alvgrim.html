One day I was standing inside the castlelike building containing three gigantic blast furnaces - and suddenly I had the idea how to start live action role-plays and adventures for kids, set in these historical buildings. The following days the ideas flooded my mind and in a week I had written the backstory of the Alvgrim People and their nemesis The Committee, created different characters for the children to choose from, outlined the first adventure and started raising the money to pay for costumes, props, website, marketing, actors etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2012-\u003cstrong\u003e2013\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInspired by the story of the Alvgrim People (whose main traits are creativity and invention) my girlfriend started writing a fantasy novel for children, called \u003cem\u003eAlvgrim - The Dragonfly People. \u003c/em\u003eRead the first chapter for free (so far only in Swedish):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://alvgrim.se/boken/\"\u003eChapter one\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eSix months (and a professional editor) later it was ready. We published it ourselves and started selling it in the little webshop on our website.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring these six months we also initiated a number of wonderfully creative collaborations with artistic friends. It resulted in the movie above, our own secret language, specially composed Alvgrim-music for the movie and for the different characters, and costumes for the actors as well as for the children participating in the adventures. You can listen to the music and parts of the language here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/alvgrim\"\u003eAlvgrim on Soundcloud\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the summer of 2012 we launched our first adventure, \u003cem\u003eThe Beginning.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIt was a blast and we got great feedback from the children as well as their parents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if it meant doing it in our spare time and not yet making any money from it, we definitely wanted to keep building Alvgrim\u00b4s world. The joy in writing the stories, creating the characters, preparing the adventure and meeting the excited anticipation of the children was fuel enough. On Midsummer\u00b4 s Day 2013 we launched our second adventure: \u003cem\u003eNuncoth Lavdim\u00b4 s Riddle.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the fall of 2014 we decided to move to Stockholm to get closer to a lot of our friends and because the job opportunities were better there. That meant moving Alvgrim too. I scanned the whole of Stockholm \"county\" for cool historical surroundings that would match the ones we were leaving. On a small island 20+ miles outside of Stockholm there is an old fortress. It has fought off invasion attempts both from the Danes and the Russians. Today there is a hotel, a conference centre and a museum in the fortress. Check it out here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1\u0026amp;v=DLZlpVZjr5s\"\u003eThe Fortress of Vaxholm\u003c/a\u003e.

This time I found a castle 25 miles north of Stockholm. The oldest parts of the castle are from the 14th century. It had recently changed owner and was now open for the public. Alvgrim was welcome to arrange adventures inside the castle. So we did. Three summers in a row. A brand new adventure each year:\u003cbr\u003e2015: \u003cem\u003eThe Earl and the Marzipan Mystery\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e2016: \u003cem\u003eThe Golden Key\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e2017: \u003cem\u003eThe Committee and the Codes\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out the castle here (in English):\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wenngarn.se/english/\"\u003eWenngarn Castle\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough the adventures were popular and we kept getting great feedback, Alvgrim also needed to expand in order to ever make enough profit to become our main occupation. Moreover we realized we had to be closer to the city to make it easier for people to visit us. In the summer of 2016 we arranged our first summer camp, right in the middle of Stockholm Old Town, and have continued to create summer camps since then. In September 2017 we welcomed our first \"students\" to once-a-week-courses. One course in Swedish and one in English (for children from international schools in Stockholm).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to see pictures and short videos from our adventures, summer camps and courses the best source is our Facebook page.

We rent space in a cultural centre (not far from the Royal Palace) for our classes/camps/adventures as well as for all\u00a0our costumes/stuff.\u00a0And then we use the whole of outdoor Old Town for the activities. After our first nomadic years we have found the place where we want to stay and further develop Alvgrim. Because there are a lot more we want to create within the realms of Alvgrim.\u003cbr\u003ePlease read more about that under Goals.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAseem Svedberg,\u003cbr\u003ecreator and owner of Alvgrim"
