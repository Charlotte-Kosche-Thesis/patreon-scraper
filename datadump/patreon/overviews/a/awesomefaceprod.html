    "summary": "Hey, Patreon. My name is Matt, Although you probably know me online as AwesomeFaceProd.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy playing video games, and video editing. Those two things have combined into the creation of my YouTube channel where for the past five years I\u0027ve been creating quality gaming content for the web. Over the course of those 5 years my channel has grown at a steady rate but given the fact that the YouTube gaming community has grown exponentially and YouTubes own search algorithm favors larger channels it\u0027s been much hard to maintain my once booming little YouTube channel. The decrease in ad revenue from YouTube certain isn\u0027t helping the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I\u0027m reaching out to you the fine folks of Patreon, for the past five years I\u0027ve funded the creation of my YouTube channel all on my own, whither it be by working a part-time landscaping job when I was first starting out to using the money I\u0027ve received from YouTube to further fund my own endeavors. Point is, I\u0027ve never asked for a handout and I wouldn\u0027t be doing this if I didn\u0027t think it was necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I want to be clear, I will not be hiding any content behind a Patreon paywall, I understand this might limit incentive for supporters but I don\u0027t want to alienate a group of people just because they can\u0027t or don\u0027t want to support me. However to those of you who have enjoyed my content enough that you would consider sending some extra cash my way I would encourage you to check out some of the rewards that I\u0027m offering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for you time and I hope that you would consider supporting me on patreon."
