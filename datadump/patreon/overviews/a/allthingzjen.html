    "summary": "Hello and thank you for stopping by my Patreon page. More than likely, you know me from YouTube. I have a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/allthingzjen\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e with almost 30k followers. The reason why I created a YouTube channel is because I wanted to share my own personal experience and struggles with weight loss. My first video on YouTube has over 4 million hits. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwzfIXySfvQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never in a million years expected it to receive that much attention and I never thought that I would one day have so many supportive viewers watching. I love the whole YouTube experience, from creating and editing videos to reading and responding to your comments. I love the online community that I\u0027ve created and hope that it will only continue to grow from here on out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThree months ago, a viewer of mine suggested that I create a Patreon page so that they could show support by donating. That was obviously a very flattering request but to me it just felt weird to ask my viewers for money. After all, I upload videos on YouTube for free without expecting anything in return. Well, maybe a like and a comment would be nice :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe point is, it just doesn\u0027t feel right to ask for money for something I already do for free, however, I really could use the help. I am currently unemployed and I\u0027m looking for ways to make extra income. Right now, my only source of income is from YouTube ads and while it does help me tremendously, it is certainly not enough to sustain myself. So then I remembered PATREON!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s the deal... I will continue to do what I am currently doing which is create videos for YouTube ABSOLUTELY FREE. However, for those of you interested in seeing more of me, when I\u0027m not on YouTube, you\u0027ll be able to see more of me here on Patreon. I am offering this option to those of you who would like to feel more connected with me and/or would just simply like to help. So, please don\u0027t feel pressured if this is not your thing. I totally understand! Just know, that if you do decide to help me out and become a patron, I will be so appreciative and love you forever!!! :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://preview.ibb.co/cQ6HsH/29064438_1626625777385721_1953152088767093049_o.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
