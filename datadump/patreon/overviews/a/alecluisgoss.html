    "summary": "My name is Alec Goss, I\u0027m a drummer, and my mid-life crisis happened at the age of 21. For the longest time, I was Lord Alec, King of Lazyberg, from the province of Lethargia, in the country of Don\u0027t-Touch-Me-I\u0027m-Sleeping-a. I got A\u0027s without studying, made varsity baseball by not practicing, and got girlfriends without talking (because it made me seem mysterious(?) muahaha). Now I know what you\u0027re thinking, \"Alec, this isn\u0027t making me want to support you financially. Actually, I kind of hate you. In fact, I\u0027m currently lighting a bag of dog poop on fire on your porch as I\u0027m reading this\". WAIT, before you do that, let me just explain that I hate that Alec too. He was the WORST. So bad actually that I left him a couple years ago. You see the thing I haven\u0027t even gotten to yet, is that there is one thing I am obsessed with, and that is music. I have worked harder on being a musician than anything else. The only problem is that I\u0027ve always been scared of being a musician. It seemed to me that in music you\u0027re either Adam Levine famous (and handsome) or a struggling nobody (and smelly). But when my finance professor told my class one day, \"eh, don\u0027t try so hard. Don\u0027t try to be \u0027that guy\u0027 who\u0027s trying to make it big, just be normal. You\u0027ll have a decent life and then die, and nothing will matter\". At that moment I realized 1. uh worst college class ever? And 2. I\u0027m done being scared to follow my passion. In a way he was right. When I die nothing will matter. But what does matter to ME is that I\u0027m NOT normal. Because I\u0027m clearly pretty weird. Since that class, I practice 2-6 hours a day, play in a couple bands, started a YouTube channel where I make weird videos of me playing drums, and went from an A+ finance student to a B- (I\u0027m most proud of that last one. Shout out to my parents). This is where Patreon comes in. As a finance and economics major, I can explain to you in broad academic language that: me need money 2 music erryday. Now I\u0027m not just going to ask you for your money, that would make me a parasite. I don\u0027t want to be a parasite. Which is why I like Patreon because the money is small and monthly and I will be giving back to you! My patron! I\u0027ll be giving you things like behind the scenes info on my journey, personal drum lessons, and shoutouts if I somehow become Adam Levine famous. But most importantly I\u0027m going to be giving you every ounce of gratitude I can wring out of my body (ouch). A musician is nothing without his support and let me tell you, Alec, King of TryHardville, is going to give 110% on his career and patrons. Thank you for reading this and thanks for the support and if you become one of my patrons I promise I will never talk in the 3rd person again."
