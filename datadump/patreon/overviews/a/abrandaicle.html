Now that your here, let me introduce myself. My name is Abranda and you can find more information about me and my work at\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.abrandaicle.com./\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.abrandaicle.com.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I am an artist, painter, sculpture, and crafter specializing in the romantic and spiritual fantasy genre. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr at least I used to be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFrom 2004 to 2009 I realized my dream as an artist and quit my full time job to do nothing but art. While I did have to work part time occasionally to help support myself and my daughter, it was an amazing adventure and one that truly brought me joy despite how tight finances could be. Eventually the economy took a turn for the worse and insurance and rent got harder and harder to afford. \u00a0I met my now husband in 2009 and he got me a job that started out as just a temporary position, but quickly evolved into a full time salaried role that I somehow was successful at. I don\u0027t work for a soul sucking corporation that I hate, but rather have become successful in a role that I can\u0027t just walk away from. One that supports my family\u0027s needs and affords the stability that working in the corporate world can. I\u0027m not wealthy by any means, but I\u0027m no longer a starving artist either. I have simply stopped being an artist altogether. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nSo why am I on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI wake up every day and feel like I am missing something in my life. I have 3 wonderful children that I love with all my heart, a husband who is the light of my life, and a job that I am very good at that has given me an incredibly flexible schedule. But I am missing the part of me that separates me from everyone else. And as I stare at the empty sketch book on my desk, it is driving me insane.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI knew from an early age that being an artist was what would define and distinguish me from everyone else. And while I love my family and would doing anything for them, having given up this part of myself has left a huge void in my identity. With Patreon support I\u0027m hoping to get word out and prove to myself and my family that I can make a living as an artist while still being a mom and wife and not only just get by, but be incredibly successful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\nWhat is my goal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be an artist and make a career out of it! If I can prove that there is enough of a fan base out there to support me quitting my full time job and that I can keep up with the demand while still taking care of my family, then I can get back into the market and be the artist I know I was born to be. My hope is that with your support I will gain more inspiration to create more art consistently and push myself to new skills levels while increasing my fan base and networking community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have previously painted a variety of fairies and angels in watercolor and graphite, specializing in a fairytale fantasy theme while showing my work across the US at Fantasy/Sci Fi conventions and hosting my own website. \u00a0I currently manufacture my own prints using a fine art print reproduction technology with archival inks and papers. I am also an adept crafter and have been able to produce custom professional merchandise featuring my work.\u00a0Over the last year I have explored digital art creation and am working to take my art to a whole new level of story telling while branching out into this new medium, focusing on a more spiritual and romantic style that defines how I feel about my life and my art. Spiritually of all types will likely become the front line of my portfolio with a strong mix of other themes in mythology, including Arthurian Legend, Shakespearian themes, and possibly some Steam Punk just for fun. I also intend to explore some more abstract techniques and even some wildlife work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I currently working on?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u2019m winging it. Too be truthful honest, until this is no longer a \u2018I\u2019ll do it when the kids (or hubby) aren\u2019t screaming for my attention\u201d venture, I\u2019m not really in a place to make a plan. So whatever I have the time to work on is what I am working on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I not want from Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you are low on funds, please, do not feel obligated to pledge. My goal is to build a fan base and gain confidence in that support. All of my reward tiers are focused on benefiting both me and my Patrons by encouraging new creations and rewarding continued support. But I will continue to create no matter my Patron contributions. It just might take me longer to release work. If you cannot Pledge but still want to show your support, you can also keep up with me on Instagram @abrandaicle and on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/abrandaicle\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for taking the time to read and for your support! I look forward to taking you with me on my journey!\u003c/strong\u003e"
