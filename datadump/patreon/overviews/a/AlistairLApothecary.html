    "summary": "\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eHi!\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alis and I like to make things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTime to Get Geeky Clean!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I noticed that the market for geeky bath bombs was woefully lacking and I did some research to see what I could do about that. When I candidly pitched the idea to some friends online, I received a lot of positive encouragement about it. And then I remembered that my dad, who is also nerdy, enjoys baths as well and might be excited about the bath bomb ideas that I had. But the problem is that he has pretty severe psoriasis, so a lot of the usual bath bomb ingredients would irritate his skin. I spent some time looking and I came up with some ideas for fizzy, nerdy bath bombs that would be all-natural, cruelty-free, body-safe, that also possess healing properties and still look pretty cool when tossed in the tub. I want to make bath bombs that smell good, look good, are fun, and safe for everyone, especially people like my dad. I\u0027ve got a lot of ideas, but I need a lot to get started and it\u0027s gonna be real expensive...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"\"\u003e\u003cb style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003eHalp?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now I\u0027ve got these ideas. The next phase of this project is getting everything funded. You want some D20s and minis in your bath bombs? Video game and fantasy-themed ones? Unicorns-shapes? Dragon eggs? I\u0027m not even touching the Pokemon themed ones. Those seem to be everywhere! I want to do something different. I\u0027ve even been doing some research into adding some more \"masculine\" fragrances to bath bombs and come across some pretty unique scents for that. Let\u0027s just say I think those ones are going to be pretty popular with the space cowboys of today.\u003cbr\u003eAre you a tea aficionado? Soak into a fizzy tea-leaf bath! Like milk and honey baths? Gotcha covered.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve got so many ideas and I think you guys will be pretty impressed with the final product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI estimate it\u0027ll be maybe a couple hundred dollars to start up, but if I can get some real support for this, I don\u0027t think it will be long before I can start making you all some fabulously geeky smell-goods. So spread the word! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a monthly Patron today, get yourself a tier reward, or donate\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://paypal.me/quetzalqueertl\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!"
