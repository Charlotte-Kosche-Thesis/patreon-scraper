    "summary": "At 8 years old I fell in love with Basketball. If I wasn\u0027t playing in my front yard or at school. I was watching it or playing it in a video game. I use to drive my friends crazy because I would announce the game as we played. If it was tv or playing Sega I would mute it and be my own announcer. As My hoop dreams faded and I became a father I started to coach my kid\u0027s youth games and eventually turned that into getting paid to coach Basketball at a small Charter school for the last 5 years. I have now moved on to working with high-risk youth at a boys group home. Over the last 10 years I had made several attempts at starting a Basketball Blog and do warriors highlights, but life came up. In somewhat of an early midlife crisis (33) I decided it\u0027s now or never to pursue my dream of working in sports media. So here we are! I put in about 20 hours a week on my videos but am looking to be able to do it full time. The NBA copyright claims my highlights so I am not able to make any money from youtube, That has brought me to Patreon! The perks will continue to grow but as of now this is what I have planned for my Patrons\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExclusive bonus\u00a0coverage videos of Warriors and other teams as well as some training video for my hoopers I specialize in player development\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- Prizes I had put Curry and KD shoes, but thinking about it I\u0027m going to give away new Authentic Jersey\u0027s, I realize the shoes would only appeal to a few of you.\u003cbr\u003e- Requests and possible collaborations\u00a0with other creators\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you for considering supporting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlchemy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
