I\u0027m Ashkatom, writer and streamer. Escapism is one of the most important things in the world to me, and providing people with the means to take some time out of their day and be immersed in an experience where the world\u0027s a bit less shitty is something I have always striven for.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/06d21d31bb77973c2481cfc1b7d661cf/tumblr_p5bpl8gcPX1r5kcl0o3_540.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eWell, I write and I stream video games. For the purposes of this Patreon, I write. I write mostly fun hurt/comfort-ish short stories, often with a side of smut \u2014 the perfect thing for that escapism I mentioned earlier. I particularly like exploring unusual relationships (platonic and romantic!), and the art of making them functional. Mostly, I write stories wherein the participants really, truly \u003cem\u003ecare\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0about each other, and act like it \u2014 the thousand ways it can go wrong, and the thousand and one ways it can go right.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/29fc6ae6c413143199466936014e88da/tumblr_p5bpl8gcPX1r5kcl0o6_540.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nHopefully because you like my work! Obvious answer aside, who doesn\u0027t need a little idealistic wish fulfilment from time to time? If you have always wanted to believe in the ability of people to care about each other, if you like watching people put effort into making their unique relationships work, if you want more stories about poly people or queer people or kinky people, hello! I am here for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/5fded931404cb91769ace73a602e8674/tumblr_p5bpl8gcPX1r5kcl0o5_540.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nI want to build a community. I \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0talking about my writing with people, and I really miss having a wider audience. I\u0027ve been writing solely original works for over a year now, honing the craft and ensuring that this level of production is sustainable, and I am finally\u00a0ready to start producing works for the public sphere again. As much as I\u0027d love to post everything for free \u2014 and I understand how hard it is to take a risk on an author, sight-unseen \u2014 my living situation at the moment means that I just can\u0027t. Patreon seems like a good middle ground: you support at whatever tier you want and get some Quality Words\u2122; I don\u0027t have to choose between taking my cat to the vet or eating. It\u0027s extremely win-win!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/18ddaeed08d82fb9a5808b5072b5cfb2/tumblr_p5bpl8gcPX1r5kcl0o1_540.png\"\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nI know, I am a weird conglomeration of creative efforts! If you want to toss me a few bucks here because it\u0027s easier for you than getting a Twitch subscription, I\u0027m not about to complain.
