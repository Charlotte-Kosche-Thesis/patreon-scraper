    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Ante! I make vore animations! These things tend to take a lot of time and effort to make and since lately I\u0027ve found more time to make them, I decided to open this Patreon so those of you who can\u0027t afford that much of somebody\u0027s time can still help support me and give feedback about what you\u0027d like to see!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow is this going to work? When I reach my Patreon goals, I\u0027ll work on a video for my patrons. I\u0027ll keep an ear out for suggestions for predators, prey, and the general theme of an animation and when the goal is reached, I\u0027ll create polls for patrons to vote on and try my best to create a video everyone will enjoy based on the results! This way, everyone can have some input on what I create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease note that I\u0027ll only animate original characters. I know we\u0027d all love to see our favorite big corporate cartoon characters eat each other, but not as much as I don\u0027t want to see a lawsuit. I will instead create original characters based on your feedback for use in these animations, so when suggesting characters, a suggesting something similar to a certain character is still helpful!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow about rewards? I\u0027m keeping the rewards pretty cheap, and because this sort of thing takes a long time, none of them involve me modeling or animating. Taking that much time out of my main work to work on something for specific people isn\u0027t fair to the rest of the patrons who would have to wait longer for my next video. Instead, I\u0027m limiting my rewards to access to work in progress animations and early builds of interactive vore animations. Early access? More like early... snack...cess. If the goal is met for a patron-funded animation, you can also be featured in the special thanks for that video! I\u0027m also giving access to the .blend files for my original characters. Think of the unspeakable things you can do to me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo come on, let\u0027s make some nifty animated vore!"
