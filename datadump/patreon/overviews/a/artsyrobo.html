    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Marlon Leal, aka ArtsyRobo; I\u0027m a Brazilian full time digital artist. I\u0027m a freelancer, and I work 7-8 hours a day on commissions, every day of the week.\u003cbr\u003eArt is my passion, my main interest, my work and still main hobby. I like drawing fanarts from many different cartoons (like Steven Universe, Star Vs The Forces of Evil, and others), games (from Sony, Nintendo, Blizzard and many others), anime, and so on.\u003cbr\u003eI also have my own artistic projects, some things I\u0027m yet to work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e There\u0027s nothing else I would rather work with. So, even though work on commissions all the time is a lot of work, I still beats working with anything else that isn\u0027t art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, in order to have a decent income through art, I only have time to work on commissions and nothing else. I love drawing fanarts, and I have my own artistic projects, but I can\u0027t do anything else as long as I still need to work on commissions every day. I don\u0027t make a lot with each commission; in order to compensate for my lack of visibility, I need to make my commissions prices too low so I can get enough of them for the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if I get enough help from people wanting to see more of art every month, I\u0027ll be able to not have to work on commissions every day, and I\u0027ll have time to work on other things, like fanarts, posters, from simple doodles to big complex pieces of shows and games I like, and you may like too. That would be great! Not only it would help me not overworking myself with commissions 24/7, it would greatly help me keep being passionate about art and finally work on my own projects, like my own webcomic. So please consider pledging a little every month, I would really appreciate it! I\u0027m excited with everything I\u0027ll be able to create again if I get enough help from you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith enough help, you can expect complex painted illustrations every month, speedpaint videos, art tutorials, wips, sketches, news from the upcoming webcomic project, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
