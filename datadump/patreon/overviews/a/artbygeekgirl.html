    "summary": "I\u0027m a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Mormons). One cool thing about our religion is that we don\u0027t have paid clergy. As a result, we get chances to serve in different areas of the church. We also get to substitute a lot. That\u0027s where my story starts.\u003cbr\u003eOne Sunday, I was substituting in the library. There was a big bucket of \"Free!\" stuff. Mostly VHS tapes and old teaching manuals. There were also a handful of hymnbooks. Underneath the counter there were a few more hymnbooks. These books were in seriously sad shape. I decided to rescue them before they went to the garbage. Originally, I was thinking of making some Christmas banners or some other small projects. Then, when we were in Sacrament Meeting (the most important part of our church service), we sang Joseph Smith\u0027s First Prayer. This song is beautiful. But here\u0027s the thing, my singing voice is not so beautiful. So while I\u0027m doing my best not to scare those around me, I could see in my mind the beautiful spring morning in Palmyra- the trees, the birds singing, and the pillar of light.  I wished so desperately to be able to let others see what I see!!! And then it hit me. I COULD DO THAT!!!!\u003cbr\u003eRewind a little bit- I\u0027ve been praying for years to help find ways to bring the Spirit into people\u0027s homes using art. I tried the fancy calligraphy with incredible sayings, but that didn\u0027t work so well.\u003cbr\u003eBack to my story. When I got home and broke out the watercolors, something magical happened- When that paint hit the water, not only did the color just release, but so did my worries, my stress, and all the negative emotions that had been pent up. This became my release.\u003cbr\u003eBut the blessings didn\u0027t stop there. My kids wanted me to sing the songs I was painting- even with my not so stellar voice. We began learning about the words and the scriptures that came with it. The Spirit became stronger IN MY OWN HOME! \u003cbr\u003eAfter things were improved at home, then other people started being interested in my art. And now, here we are.\u003cbr\u003e"
