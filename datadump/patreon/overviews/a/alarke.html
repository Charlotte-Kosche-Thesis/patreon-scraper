    "summary": "HELLO, loves! Welcome to my Patreon page. It\u0027s a world of gems and delights, like exclusive monthly hangouts, behind-the-scenes life, unreleased songs, secret art, and lots more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is it - the future of sustainable art. I\u2019ve learned that the only thing I really need as an artist is my \nlisteners. You. You are the ones who fill me with so much inspiration - \nyour stories ARE life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is for people who want to help sustain my ability to make music and art.\u00a0You have made albums, videos, touring, and \nperformances possible. Your pledge towards my work goes directly to support me, my collaborators, and\n production costs. For an overview of how Patreon works, go \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwvUjAv6pxg\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eHERE\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e. Essentially, you pledge $1 or more for each new thing I create. You can set a monthly limit (even $1) and cancel patronage at any \ntime, even after songs and things\u00a0that you\u0027ve pledged for are released. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of Kickstarter or IndieGogo, which are platforms for one-off projects where you can show support by pre-ordering a record, for example, Patreon is more of a regular: it\u0027s monthly- or project-based support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange for your support, you will have access to our patron-only community here where you will be the first to learn what\u0027s in the works, \nreceive updates, and interact with me and other patrons.\n There are also additional levels of support where you\u2019ll receive song \ndownloads, art prints, and more, and it\u2019s where we can personally connect on a \ndeeper level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat\u0027s in the works right now? I have a Cuban Diaries album I wrote and recorded when I created my own month-long solo artist retreat in Cuba in August 2017. I hired an incredible 6-piece Cuban band, rented a studio, and hired an amazing team of engineers. I\u0027d like to mix and master those tracks and get them out to you and to the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also been writing fun electronic dance tracks monthly and have about 9 in the works. Some are in their final stages and just need to be mixed and mastered and have some graphic design done - then they\u0027re out in the world! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have a large, colorful painting that I\u0027d make prints of and send out to the world, and I\u0027d love to make more paintings and prints for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou mean so much to me and are all equally important to me. My creations have a purpose and are possible because you care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for believing in me and my music. Let\u0027s go make magic together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMary Alouette AKA\u00a0Alarke\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me:\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAs an opera student at McGill University in Montreal, Mary Alouette AKA Alarke developed an interest that didn\u2019t necessarily correspond to her studies: electronic music. It took moving to Brooklyn and embarking on a career as a gypsy jazz singer to finally bring electronica into the mix\u2026\u201d \u2013 The Washington Post\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy favorite performances include: the Rainbow Room, Blues Alley, Strathmore, Carnegie Hall, the Kennedy Center, the Apollo Theater, the National Anthem for the Baltimore Orioles and the Washington Nationals, and live film scoring at Nitehawk Cinema. I studied piano and percussion and recorded hip hop and jazz albums in Cuba, studied Gypsy jazz vocals and guitar in a French Gypsy caravan, worked as an audio engineer in New York City, and studied and performed opera in Austria and Italy. My four electronic and jazz albums have won the Grand Prize in the Washington Area Music Association\u2019s Songwriting Competition, New Artist of the Year, and Best Debut Album. I was an Artist-in-Residence at Strathmore and with the Brooklyn Arts Council, and received a Bachelors of Music in Vocal Performance from McGill University. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind me online:\u003cbr\u003eWEBSITE: \u003ca href=\"http://www.alarke.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.alarke.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram: \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/alarke_\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.instagram.com/alarke_\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/alarke_\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFACEBOOK: \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/alarkemusic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/alarkemusic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOUTUBE: \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/lookalarke\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/user/lookalarke\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/atethesandwich\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S.
