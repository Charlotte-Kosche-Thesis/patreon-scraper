That was still a little intimidating to me at the time, which is funny because I didn\u0027t and still don\u0027t really think of myself as a techie person, even if I take pride in most of my digital illustrations. \u003cbr\u003eIntimidating as it was, I thought I\u0027d better gear myself with an equally sturdy strategy to make sure I don\u0027t fail...enter plaaaaants :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI had discovered \u003ca href=\"http://theplanthunter.com.au/\"\u003ehttp://theplanthunter.com.au/ ,\u003c/a\u003e a beautiful online publication the year before and I was mesmerized with these people from the other end of the world and their gentle ways.\u003cbr\u003eI remembered a few times when I would be looking through some gardening albums I found in my parents\u0027 house, thinking it would be nice to know such things one day and maybe even design gardens, but quickly abandoned\u00a0the quest, not really knowing where to start, seeming a too unrealistic task and having more pressing problems at the time.\u003cbr\u003eSo last year, when I was thinking of starting this project, plants reappeared on my mental map.\u003cbr\u003eThis time they seemed more than practical - I would not be paralyzed by the dilemma of what to draw next, it would be an uncontroversial subject (mostly), which I really needed at the time and I would learn heaps of new things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://mir-cdn.behance.net/v1/rendition/project_modules/max_1200/3a50e248386291.59c52e675745c.png\" style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eAnd that is what I did, I started with graphite pencil, then a few colored pencils, then watercolor and acrylic. This year I started drawing and painting birds. That was a little unexpected, I don\u0027t know how I go to birds, but their colored plumage and variety of shapes and details is stunning and my artistic sensibility was definitely tingled.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI did not make a lot of progress with my knowledge in the field (either of plants or birds), still I am optimistic that slowly but surely it will be there some day. I just spoke to someone interested in mushrooms today and he said his aim is to learn two types of mushrooms each year - I find that encouraging!\u003cbr\u003eI like the pace of this project so far and I have to thank Emma, my first and real Patreon (we are not related :p ), for making this project an ongoing one.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFor the past nine months she has been the sole beneficiary of most of my posts, that I have decided to make public from this point forward. If you choose to support, you will receive original drawing or watercolors in your postal mail, in an envelope with a stamp.\u003cbr\u003eI hope you do join and we grow this project and ourselves in the process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(February 2018)\u003cbr\u003e___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(January 2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHi!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy name is Ada Popescu and I\u0027m an illustrator starting a new project - it\u0027s about plants!
