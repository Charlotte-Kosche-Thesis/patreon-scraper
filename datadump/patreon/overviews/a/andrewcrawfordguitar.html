So, I have to be able to provide for my entire family so that my wife can stay home and take care of him. \u00a0Being able to do that with just my income from the band and teaching private lessons is quite a challenge, and leaves very little time for me to spend with my family. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are no words I could use to give my patrons the thanks you deserve. \u00a0You guys make it possible for me to be able to express my heart through my art!! \u00a0I am so thankful to have this opportunity to share my music and talents to a special community of people who support me!! \u00a0Each and every one of my patrons is truly a blessing to me and my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion for making music and playing the guitar is as much as a gift to me as the talent to be able to do it. \u00a0But teaching and helping others learn to play is equally as important to me. \u00a0Along with exclusively sharing new songs I write for you guys and posting videos of my new ideas and things that I love to play, I will also be posting weekly instructional videos and tablature for all of my subscribing patrons. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAND........ consider yourself part of my team. \u00a0Because when my album releases, you will get a free copy along with a CD release party performance exclusively for my patrons. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy subscribing and being a patron, you are truely a part of my music and the musical legacy I will one day leave behind. \u00a0God bless you all,\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Andrew"
