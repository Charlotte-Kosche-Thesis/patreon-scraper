    "summary": "Hello! I\u0027m Paul Rissen. I\u0027ve long been fascinated with the art of storytelling and narrative, harbouring desires to be a scriptwriter or director since I was young.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince being in full-time employment, I\u0027ve tried my hand at scriptwriting, stand-up comedy, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.r4isstatic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblogging\u003c/a\u003e, but the closest I\u0027ve got to scratching that creative, narrative itch has been in the projects I did whilst working at the BBC, namely\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.r4isstatic.com/80\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethe Mythology Engine\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.r4isstatic.com/portfolio/storybox\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStorybox\u003c/a\u003e and as part of a team developing ideas and prototypes around\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/2015/07/07/a-manifesto-for-structured-journalism/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estructured journalism\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI recently left the Beeb, but am determined to keep my hand in the mix in terms of creative projects around storytelling, narrative, the Web and journalism - albeit in my spare time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is where this Patreon comes in.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://acraftofstorytelling.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eA Craft of Storytelling\u003c/a\u003e comes off the back of a workshop session I ran at Mozfest 2016, entitled\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://tinyurl.com/beyondhero\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeyond the Hero\u0027s Journey - What do we mean when we talk about \u0027Storytelling\u0027?\u003c/a\u003e, in which I covered some of the ideas\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://justtv.wordpress.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJason Mittell\u003c/a\u003e discusses in his excellent book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://mcpress.media-commons.org/complextelevision/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eComplex TV - The Poetics of Contemporary Storytelling\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s my first attempt to build on that workshop and start exploring these topics in more detail, hopefully to the benefit of a wider audience. Personally, I\u0027d also like to develop my knowledge and expertise in this area, especially in terms of how it relates to digital experiences and modern journalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEssentially, my mission is simple. I want to understand the techniques of storytelling, so that all of us, both as creators and as audiences, can become more literate in storytelling craft. Only by doing so, do I believe that we can better decipher the intent behind the stories being told - and be more effective in communicating with each other.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps more importantly, in the wake of \u0026#8216;fake news\u0026#8217; scandals, and the apparent existential crises within traditional newsrooms, journalists are increasingly looking towards narrative and \u0026#8216;web native\u0026#8217; storytelling to enthral audiences, build attention, and if you\u0026#8217;re lucky, inform, educate and entertain. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0026#8217;s for this latter reason, especially, that I believe it\u0026#8217;s not good enough just to let \u0026#8216;storytelling\u0026#8217; remain a buzzword. To let it be dropped into conversations, marketing spiel and job descriptions, without an understanding of what the term actually means, without an appreciation and knowledge for the craft which it entails. Coherent storytelling, quality journalism, and thus a well-informed society, is too crucial to be thrown onto the bonfire of vapidity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn each episode, I\u0026#8217;ll be exploring a technique or element of storytelling craft from across TV, film, radio and digital media, and considering its\u0026#8217; pros and cons. What does the use of each tool allow a storyteller to do? What effect does it have on those receiving the story? And what are the implications, and consequences, both intended and unintended, when these techniques are used?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just getting started, so this is very much a toe-in-the-water, to see whether I\u0027m able to get any funding through Patreon, but if the podcast is a success, this will fuel further episodes, extra rewards, perhaps even spin-off or other podcasts - anything that can help me build up a portfolio of creative work in this area. I\u0027d also, more importantly, like to donate money to charities supporting those that are most in need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
