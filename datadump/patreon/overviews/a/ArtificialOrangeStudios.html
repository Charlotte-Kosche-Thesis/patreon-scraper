This blog revolves around an alternate version of the character, Sweetie Belle, who has now self proclaimed herself as Meanie Belle. \u00a0After taking a brunt of punishment and insults from the internet fandom, Sweetie Belle has decided to stop being a sweetie and instead be a meanie. \u00a0The only problem is... she\u0027s not very good at being mean. \u00a0Despite this, she tries her clumsy best at being a rebel, and never give up. \u00a0She\u0027s also a bit of a pyro, and likes setting people\u0027s yards on fire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://thiklestia.tumblr.com/\"\u003eThiklestia\u003c/a\u003e - This blog revolves around an alternate version of the character, Princess Celestia. \u00a0In this reality she\u0027s become a tad bottom heavy from her extreme love of cake. \u00a0Celestia still rules her country with love and compassion, but is also depressed over her lack of love and her clumsy failures at getting into shape. \u00a0The latter that isn\u0027t helped by her sister, StickLuna\u0027s teasing. \u00a0Despite this StickLuna still desperately tries to help her sister get in shape. \u00a0Now if head maid, Cold Front, would stop feeding her all those cakes...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideos\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAnd last, but definitely not least, is my video projects. \u00a0These are posted on my YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/artificialorange\"\u003eArtificial Orange Studios (aka Pemmy Plays)\u003c/a\u003e, these videos usually have to deal with the subjects of video games and animation, as they are subjects very dear to me. \u00a0I also post videos of me drawing updates or random artwork for fun. \u00a0Below are the types of shows my channel presents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqOSXN8-sNU\u0026amp;list=PLl9QSjdExv0a_-rbKZMSk8vT43SZMmnF-\"\u003eLet\u0027s Draw\u003c/a\u003e -

This is a set of \"Let\u0027s Play\" videos where I play a video game with a friend of mine, and we provide commentary throughout the video for the viewer\u0027s enjoyment. \u00a0These are fun to make, and allows me to introduce people to many new games they may have never heard of. \u00a0I prefer to do indie games and retro video games, but will sometimes delve into more well known areas. \u00a0The link goes to my Undertale Let\u0027s Play since it is the most popular among my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WaW-gDLyGU\u0026amp;list=PLl9QSjdExv0a5ui59EAXvbFGM7It2u1kp\"\u003eCartoon Catastrophes\u003c/a\u003e - Probably my most popular series of videos, these videos have me watching old cartoons of varying quality, and review it in a comedic manner. \u00a0I will give an overview of two episodes of a show (unless it\u0027s a single episode pilot), make jokes along the way, point things out among the video, and give it an overall review of whether or not I think it is a \"catastrophe\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7h0QjuHSpzw\u0026amp;list=PLl9QSjdExv0YcmEtEkLWxGMZiP-Ay-dZp\"\u003eArcade Funhouse\u003c/a\u003e - One of my longest running series, Arcade Funhouse is a series where I review the various arcade games from the 80s and 90s. \u00a0This series reviews a wide variety of games from this area, ranging from popular games like Paperboy and Sinistar to more obscure games like Mutant Night and Chameleon. I go over the levels, gameplay, and entire structure of the game and inform you if I feel the game is fun and worth looking into, while also giving a little humor to go with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsAjq8wpYkg\u0026amp;list=PLl9QSjdExv0Z0A7BuTD3keyu8toyjofPi\"\u003eSteam Room\u003c/a\u003e - Another review show, but this one focuses on various indie games on Steam. \u00a0Like AFH, I try to go over all the games pros and cons in a humorous fashion to both entertain and inform you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATsOadbHHaw\u0026amp;list=PLl9QSjdExv0Y9s2PvBd7REwa7pbA-PF1q\"\u003eCartoon Commentary\u003c/a\u003e - The final of my YouTube shows is Cartoon Commentary, a set of videos where a friend and I will watch a bad cartoon and provide humorous commentary throughout it. \u00a0Think of it as a cartoon version of Mystery Science Theater 3000.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s a presentation of everything I wish to provide for your entertainment. \u00a0If you can provide some support, I would greatly appreciate it. \u00a0I can only hope that I can make my projects worth your time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time.\u003cbr\u003e"
