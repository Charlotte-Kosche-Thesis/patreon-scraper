     "about": "A collaboration between veterans of the Philadelphia folk scene, A Fistful of Sugar was convened in late 2010 to solve all the world\u0027s problems with pretty little tunes. So far, so good.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCentered around strong, lush vocal harmonies and driving \"new folk\" instrumentals, the product is a distinctly modern sound that resonates with echoes of 1930s hot jazz, traditional \u0027old-timey\u0027 country, gypsy jazz, and other roots musics. With five vocalists and distinctly bluegrassy instrumentation, A Fistful of Sugar has wowed audiences across the Northeast with their powerful, genre-bending, energetic performances that range from the syrupy-sweet to the gritty and swampy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Fistful of Sugar completed their self-titled demo in August 2012 and released their first full-length studio album, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePerspicacity\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ein January 2014, and they were selected by the Philadelphia Folksong Society to perform on the main stage at the 53rd Annual Philadelphia Folk Festival in August 2014.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a short break in 2015 due to some personnel changes and the pursuit of educational goals, the band is gearing up for a busy Spring and Summer schedule in 2016.\u003cbr\u003e",
