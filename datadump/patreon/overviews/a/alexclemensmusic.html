    "summary": "\"A life is not important except for the impact it has on others\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Jackie Robinson\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started to pursue this dream of chasing a career as a musician, that\u0027s just what it was... Chasing a dream. I signed a record deal with Turkey Vulture Records, and recorded my debut album \"The Long Road Home\". It was about doing what I loved, and releasing my emotions through music. Now my reasons have completely changed, on June 25th 2015, I lost my little sister to suicide, this second album is about just that. Keeping my little sisters story alive, telling her story through music, and hoping that through my music, her story will reach out to someone. Help them realize when times are dark, it is never bad enough to take it that far. If Morgan\u0027s story saves one life. It wasn\u0027t for nothing. So now, here I am, started writing this second album, but don\u0027t have the funds to record, and produce the album. After I lost my sister, I felt lost, with no purpose, no direction, and then I realized what I felt I had to do. Now, I need all of your help to make this happen. I\u0027ve decided that this album \"This One\u0027s for You\" will be recorded in my home recording studio. I use the studio I have to record demos, and for writing new songs. To produce a professional quality album I know I will need to upgrade some of the equipment I have. The money I\u0027m trying to raise will do towards equipment upgrades, advertising prior to the release of the album, and production of the hard copies of the album. So, with that I just want to say thank you for taking the time to check out my project, and whether you decide to fund it or not, I hope you take one thing from this. You can make a difference in someone\u0027s life, sometimes all you have to do is reach out a helping hand. To find more about my music, you can find the music video for my single \"Until Then\" on YouTube, and on my facebook page:\u003cbr\u003ewww.facebook.com/alexclemensmusic\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also find Morgan\u0027s story on facebook:\u003cbr\u003eMorgan Pieper In Loving Memory\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for your time, and support. If you have any questions at all please message me."

Creating music is my outlet, it\u0027s my escape from the real world. Then I caught a break and signed a record deal with Turkey Vulture Records, and they recorded and produced my debut album. \"The Long Road Home\". You can find tracks off that album on YouTube, search: Alex Clemens - Until Then, (or copy and paste the link I will post at the bottom.) Then I moved to Florida in January of 2015, to be with my mom and little sister, so I took a break from the music scene temporarily. Now, on June 25th, when my sister died, that changed everything. For a period of time I didn\u0027t care about anything, I was just numb. But now I\u0027m making a comeback, and going to fight so I can tell her story. So I can reach out to those who are lost, and contemplating suicide. If I can create this second album, the way I see it, she will live forever!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink for the Music Video \u0027Until Then\u0027 a track off my debut album:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8MRe-YPnvLo\"\u003ehttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=8MRe-YPnvLo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLink for my facebook page:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://m.facebook.com/alexclemensmusic\"\u003ehttps://m.facebook.com/alexclemensmusic\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
