You probably know me as one half of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://xoxofest.com\"\u003eXOXO\u003c/a\u003e, an experimental festival for independent artists who work on the internet. Previously I organized\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://buildconf.com\"\u003eBuild\u003c/a\u003e, and published\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://themanual.org\"\u003eThe Manual\u003c/a\u003e, both for designers who work on the internet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are you on Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvent production is a creative practice, but not one that is particularly well understood.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvents have the potential to inspire and excite, impart knowledge and encourage deeper discourse, and conjure communities around shared values. At their best, they include and make welcome as many people as possible. Great events are products of good design, and as such, require extensive planning, collaboration, and organization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I speak with friends about the level of orchestration that goes into creating an event like XOXO, they always want to know more. So I want to share the process of producing events, and use Patreon as a platform to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere will my money go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to this Patreon, I\u2019m launching a podcast\u2014\u003cstrong\u003eAssemble\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ll be speaking with other producers and organizers about the complexities of managing events, but also with other people who build and maintain communities as part of their work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also allow me to experiment with my own event ideas. I have a long list (which includes a number of one-day conferences, film screenings with live scores, a science lecture series, and some gallery shows), and with your support, I can make these a reality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return, I\u0027ll share my unique insight into how I pull all of these events together. I\u0027ll write essays about various aspects of event production, and share what goes on behind the scenes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(You\u0027ll also be giving me the freedom to work with more community organizations and nonprofits.

At \u003cstrong\u003e$5+ per month\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u0027ll also gain early access to advance ticket sales* and video / audio from shows and performances I produce.

But it\u0027s a job that I deeply enjoy, that I\u0027m good at, and that I always want to do more of.
