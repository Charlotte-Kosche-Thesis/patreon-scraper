Basically I started cosplaying when I went to my first convention which was PAX East in 2012. I had always seen people dress up for conventions and I never got to go so when I got the opportunity I took it. For my first costume I wanted to do a League of Legends cosplay since it was and still is one of my favorite games to play to this day. I decided on Ashe since she is the first character I fell in love with. Not only because you learned the game with her but I loved archers and all things to do with snow and ice so she was perfect! With some time and experimentation with materials and what not I crafted her bow and costume and was ready to go! The experience of my first con was mind blowing! I had so much fun and made so many new friends that it made me want to continue with cosplay. My next con was NYCC 2012.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 My cosplay career didn\u0027t really kick off until I met two of my best friends Lady Kayleen \u0026amp; HarlequinJester. \u00a0Skipping a lot of details on how we met.. the 3 of us were soon together going from con to con! Through cosplay I have met tons of cosplayers, photographers, and just people in general that were awesome and now are great friends of mine.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Most of my costumes are hand crafted. In the begging I bought some and if I need something quick I might buy and alter it but for the most part I make my own stuff. I prefer to make armor over sewing things but I am getting better at it. However props are my all time favorites to make... especially the gigantic ones! I cosplay from all different kinds of things from video games, to anime, to super heroes, to tv shows, and much more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBelow are some quick examples of cosplays I have done so far.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee396/xxaurorianxx/Collage%202.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently I have been getting more into doing Boudoir cosplay shoots. These will be mostly exclusive to Patreons except for a few here and there I may post on my IG or FB. Here are a few examples below!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i1225.photobucket.com/albums/ee396/xxaurorianxx/Lingerie%20Collage%20Patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy become a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If you become a Patreon of mine you will get some exclusive content as seen in the rewards section. It is not really a big secret that cosplay can become expensive between materials, time, travel, and a lot more so by supporting me you are helping me continue with my passion as well as bringing you new materials. Basically it is a win win situation for both sides if you enjoy my content! Now I am not trying to force anyone into supporting me this way but those who want to help me continue doing what I do it would be a great help. This in no way demeans anyone who is a fan and follows me without being a Patreon. I appreciate all forms of support whether it be joining Patreon, following me on any of my social media, chatting with me at a con, writing me a nice letter or note, drawing me a picture, sharing my content, or however else you support me. Thank you everyone! \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Wish List\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://amzn.com/w/1N8VRXPEQ3JG0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://amzn.com/w/1N8VRXPEQ3JG0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot being pushy but here is another form of support.
