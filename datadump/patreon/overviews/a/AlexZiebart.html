    "summary": "Writing is my passion. Through fiction, nothing is impossible. We can delve into worlds of magic creatures and ancient things, walk among legendary warriors and superheroes, and visit places both distant and intimate. Nothing makes me happier than crafting stories people can lose themselves in for however long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s expensive, though.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen trying to deliver a polished story, costs add up. Editors are costly and necessary. Cover art is expensive, but essential to a novel\u0027s sales. Without an editor, and without eye-catching cover art, a novel is dead in the water. And that isn\u0027t even considering time \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e money. Often, while working my other jobs to pay the bills, I don\u0027t have the time to do what I really want to do anymore: tell stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first self-published was fantasy noir \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2hHP47D\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eBlood and Masks\u003c/a\u003e, followed by my current superhero series, \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2gGlwcH\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLady Superior\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ve recently released the next installment in the Lady Superior series: \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/2gvqci9\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eRookie Mistakes\u003c/a\u003e. With your support, I\u0027d like to continue the adventures of Lady Superior. And if the support is there, and it\u0027s desired, we can visit Blood and Mask\u0027s Neva Cora once again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to bringing you the ongoing tale of Lady Superior and introducing you to the many worlds I\u0027ve yet to put to paper. Hopefully, with your help, they\u0027ll hit paper sooner rather than later.\u003cbr\u003e"
