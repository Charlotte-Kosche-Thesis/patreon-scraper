    "summary": "Hi my name is Alyson Escalante. I\u0027m restructuring my patreon now because I\u0027ve fallen behind on it and I think that since creating it I have a more clear conceptions of what my creative output looks like, and how to manage a schedule for creative output, and providing patrons with something meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been active blogging for years now and devote a fair amount of time to blogging about philosophy, politics, activism, and more personal topics as well. Additionally, I have recently been branching out into writing fairly consistent long form articles on Medium dealing with issues like feminist theory, philosophy, the experience of being a public content creator, and my attempts at short fictional prose. Writing is my primary form of output. I want to expand beyond that.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to expand into doing videos as well, specifically in the video essay genre. I\u0027ve been heavily inspired by the work of hbomberguy, contrapoints, innuendo studios, and many others. This of course, takes much more time and monetary investment (recording supplies). As such, I am setting a patron goal before moving to videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have also recently changed my patreon tiers and patron models. In the past I have had consistency issues with patreon output, and have built my various tiers around scheduled content, to ensure that patrons will get what they are looking for, and know when they are getting it. Give it a look, if you\u0027re interested in supporting, let me know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@alysonescalante/a-quick-thank-you-to-my-patrons-b420f66988e\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You Note and List of Patrons Here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy patreon schedule is as followers:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month, patrons will receive access to at least one early access medium article.
