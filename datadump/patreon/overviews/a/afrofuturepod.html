    "summary": "\u003cem\u003ePeace and light melaninated earth beings, welcome to #AfroFuturePod! The premiere podcast for Afrofuturists!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is the Podcast about?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis podcast was started because I haven\u2019t found any specific outlets that were discussing Afrofuturism on a consistent basis. I got inspired to create a platform to showcase Afrofuturism media and highlight its use in pop culture. Every week I will produce content reflecting every possible aspect of Afrofuturism!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0What is Afrofuturism?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo if you have been paying attention you can probably guess that I am extremely passionate about Afrofuturism! Afrofuturism is the matching of futuristic aesthetics with African and African-American culture. It is a subgenre found in art, literature, music, and more recently television and film. The most notable Afrofuturists are musicians like Sun-Ra, Parliament, and Janelle Monae. However, it is incorporated in nearly every artist work. Additionally, I classify projects that revolve around horror and fantasy tropes in it as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is there a need for the podcast?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike I stated before, there hasn\u2019t been any consistent coverage of this topic. Sure there is the Black Nerd or \u201cBlerd\u201d movement, however it\u0027s a very broad movement where they discuss mainly mainstream content and hardly cover any content centered around Blackness. So I decided to create a niche platform to really get into detail of Afrofuturism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat to expect from the podcast?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEach episode of the podcast will be split into different segments, the first being the weekly recommendations on what Afrofuturist media to consume for the week (give an example), as well as the superhero of the week, and lastly the Afrofuturist topic of the week!\u003c/em\u003e"
