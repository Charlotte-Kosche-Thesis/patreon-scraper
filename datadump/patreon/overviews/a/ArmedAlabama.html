Hosted by Retired Alabama Circuit Judge and Certified NRA Firearms Instructor Judge Rusty Johnston and Certified NRA Law Enforcement Instructor Adam Strange.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlabama has no mandatory requirement to take a class before a CCW can be obtained.\u00a0 This keeps with the spirit of the 2nd Amendment and is fine with us. But, because of this, many people have questions about where they can carry their firearms, when they can can use deadly force, and if they should. That is where the Armed Alabama Show comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe show broadcast from FMTalk1065 in Mobile, Alabama every Tuesday from 6pm to 8pm CDT. We talk about firearms safety, legal responsibility of owning and carrying a firearm, pistols, revolvers, rifles, shotguns,\nammunition, concealed carry, personal defense training and\nattacks on our God given Right to protect ourselves and our families. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile we have commercial advertisers we do not want to be totally dependent on advertising alone as that sometime gets in the way of being totally objective.\u003cbr\u003eThe Armed Alabama Show began March 15, 2016 and expanded in July due to heavy demand. We have answered as many as 25 calls during the two hour period. Due to live streaming, we have taken calls from all over the country. \u003ca href=\"http://armedalabama.com/radio-show\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://armedalabama.com/radio-show \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFree On Demand Podcast are available at: \u003ca href=\"http://armedalabama.com/show-archive\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://armedalabama.com/show-archive\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
