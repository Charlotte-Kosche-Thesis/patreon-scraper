    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Alex Reynard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve written about a dozen furry novels by now, and I\u0027d like to make that number grow. I\u0027ve written stories about death, resurrection, war, peace, magic, technology, friendship, hatred, love and pain. I believe in putting genuine love into my characters, but never making their path too easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I am working on one of my biggest projects ever. I\u0027ve always wanted to try my hand at a Wonderland/Oz-type story, about a protagonist adrift in a strange land, meeting companions and enemies along their journey. And I thought, \u0027Why not set it in a land made of discarded nightmares?\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting takes time though, and I will admit upfront that I don\u0027t know when this epic will be finished. I\u0027m halfway done now. But because I can\u0027t give you a solid deadline, I will not expect anything more than you feel like giving. This Patreon account will be an overturned hat in front of a street performer, nothing more. If you want to contribute, you\u0027ll have my gratitude. And I won\u0027t hold any of my content for ransom. When the book is done, it will be released for free on Inkbunny (along with a downloadable soundtrack if I can scrape that together.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want you guys to see Phobiopolis. I want you to be there in the Blackdamp, in Coryza, in Ectopia Cordis, on the road to Anasarca. I want you to meet Toby, Junella, George, Doll, Zinc, Piffle, Luxy, and Aldridge. I want to show you a land of monsters, wrenches, revolvers, transformations, willwells, imaginite, ferris wheels and bloodbacon. A land where death is fleeting, but there are far worse things to fear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis will be a story where anything can happen. The more gruesome the better. If there\u0027s anything you\u0027ve always wanted to see in a dark fantasy world, let me know. No guarantees, but all ideas will be considered. And all Patrons will be acknowledged in the final work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see my novels and stories as being gifts to a community that\u0027s already bursting with art, characters, kinship and color. I am setting this account up to give you the chance, if you choose, to say thanks. And I\u0027m also doing it for my own motivation. Writers can sometimes feel like they\u0027re tossing their work into the void, not knowing if it will be seen and appreciated. Hopefully, every time I have an opportunity to write, and I feel like wandering around in Steam or YouTube instead, I\u0027ll be able to look at my page of Patrons and tell myself, \u0027They want to read this. Keep going.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve ever read a single word of mine, thank you.\u003cbr\u003e"
