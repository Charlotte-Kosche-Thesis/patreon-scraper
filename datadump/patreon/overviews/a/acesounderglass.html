someone marginally qualified investigated the first few chapters and wrote up the results, so you could make an informed judgement without spending much time on it? \u00a0I am that marginally qualified person. \u00a0I have a BA in biology and computer science, but mostly my qualification is \"reading a lot\". \u00a0For a demonstration, see my\u003ca
