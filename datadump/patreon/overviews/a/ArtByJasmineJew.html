    "summary": "I\u0027m an artist and maker of things living in Austin, Tx. I play bass in \u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/tarantulamountain\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eTarantula Mountain\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u00a0I drink a lot of coffee and I love cats. A big supporter of small businesses, local artists and bands, I work with many of my close friends in coordinating the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/AcoustiCanvas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAcoustiCanvas\u003c/a\u003e Saturday art markets in North Austin.\u00a0These shows are a fun way to see a variety of Austin\u0027s artists of all mediums showcased in a family friendly setting with acoustic music.\u003cbr\u003eI currently juggle a couple of part time jobs that allow me the free time to create art. Among my daily doodles and mini projects, I\u0027ve been working on a comic book for my former band Tombstone Union that follows the albums we\u0027ve been writing. The artwork for the comic books is based on characters developed by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.PostDreamism.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJ. B. Mendez\u003c/a\u003e and myself. Along with the comic book, I\u0027m creating a full set of tarot cards (78 individual pieces of art!) to go along with the albums.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy day to day art creation consists of a couple of \"warm up\" drawings, usually with water color or Copic Markers and Copic Multiliners. Once I\u0027m warmed up, I\u0027ll dive into some acrylic painting. If you are unfamiliar with my art, you can check it out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/MidmourningArt\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e I draw and paint a lot of female figures as animal spirits or robots. I enjoy painting Pet Portraits in unlikely color schemes. PS -\u0026gt;I do take commissions; my favorites to do are pet portraits!\u00a0Email me at ArtByJasmineJew@Gmail\u00a0for info on pet portraits or commissions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking handmade jewelry is also a favorite past time of mine and I recently launched my jewelry line under the name Witchy Nomad! I work with all kinds of crystals, semi precious stones, wire wrapping and have even incorporated teeny tiny pieces of my artwork into cameos on some necklaces and rings. You can check out what I\u0027ve made so far,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.WitchyNomad.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations to my Patreon account will go towards my working on art full time. Every little bit helps and I truly appreciate every donation!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFind me on Facebook, Gmail \u0026amp; Instagram @ArtByJasmineJew, @WitchyNomad, @TarantulaMountain, @AcoustiCanvas and @TombstoneUnion\u003cbr\u003e"
