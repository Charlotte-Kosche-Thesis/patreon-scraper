By supporting your\nfavourite content creators you\u0027re allowing them to both pay their bills AND constantly\nimprove by: purchasing better filming equipment, being able to afford a studio\nspace to film in, hiring staff to handle the business side, or editing, or filming, etc\netc. \u003cstrong\u003eThink of yourself as a business investor, or a patron of the arts!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also live with a disabling chronic illness called \"Takayasu\u0027s\nArteritis\" (read more about that \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BJB8Rrag_VD/?taken-by=littlepineneedle\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e) which has limited my future employment\noptions somewhat. I recently had to give up on my dream of becoming a research\nscientist because there was no way my body could handle 8+ hour days in a\nlaboratory. So with some sadness but also some excitement, in 2016 I decided\nthat I would make this video-making thing my full-time job. Often limited\nto my own house or unable to work for a string of days because of fatigue and\npain, I am still able to put 20-30 hours into every video (plus the many hours of work that goes on for the business-side of things), because I\u0027m now my own boss \u0026amp; can determine my own working schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, I also don\u0027t want you to see me as some charity case. \u003cstrong\u003eDonate\nbecause you see some value in what I do.
