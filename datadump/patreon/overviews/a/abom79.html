I\u0027m enjoying having a dedicated welding/grinding area and will continue to make improvements there to get things better organized.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI plan to have the garage built sometime this year and when I do that will be partial storage for my shop. That will allow me to get things better organized and out of the main shop area. This is something that I\u0027m really looking forward to, not only to help with organization, but to continue making improvements to my property here.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI really enjoy working in my shop and creating videos to share with all of my supporters. My goal is to continue doing just that and sharing all of my metal working adventures along the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
