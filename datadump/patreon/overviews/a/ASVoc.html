Being an experincian learner himself, struggling through high school and college with languages and other sheer memorization he began teaching himself car audio, and matriculated to modifying his own car and even motorcycles. After receiving his BA in Psychology from University of Rhode Island in 2004 he found work in the greater Boston area at a Department of Mental Retardation group home. He quickly rose to the position of Program Director however the fact with this population progress was meager, he began working with troubled youth.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTeenagers were the population he enjoyed working with and realized most\u00a0were not book learners (knowledge based learners) and they literally needed to grasp onto something.... ANYTHING! Since he had been a gear head since his formative year it was an epiphany in 2011 to begin working towards his utopian career automotive vocational instructor and through sacrifice and dedication completed his\nautomotive education.\u00a0 Gregg enrolled in a year long auto vocational program and followed\nthat with gaining experience working as an automotive technician for five years.  He never lost sight of his goal of becoming\nan Automotive Vocational Teacher. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October of 2017 Gregg Founded AutoShop Vocational, while he had already written the curriculum and had students from District 11 Life Skills High School, the only thing she was missing was a location. In August of that same year Gregg meet Rick Johnson (Founder) and Joy Morales Cress (Director) from the Career Building Academy who graciously donated the space for Gregg to open the doors to his career dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen to the full story on Success Radio USA, Profiles of Success here\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://tunein.com/radio/Profiles-of-Success-p919538/?topicId=119946945\"\u003ehttps://tunein.com/radio/Profiles-of-Success-p9195...\u003c/a\u003e"

     "about": "AutoShop Vocational\u2019s founder Gregg Sheldon was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts.  Early as a student in a preppy CT private school he quickly found that his passions did not align with his peers in their desire for elitism.  After prep school Gregg matriculate to University of Rhode Island and like any new venture, Gregg floundered around socially but ended up identifying with the \u201cgear heads\u201d (people who have a passion for and working on cars).  Gregg\u2019s automotive passion ignited when he fell in love with the lines of a classic Japanese sports car.\u003cbr\u003eUpon graduation from University of Rhode Island (\u201904) he dedicated his time in the Boston area at a developmentally challenged group home.  Where he quickly rose to the position of Program Director and discovered his second passion in helping others and furthering the bonds of community.  Although Gregg found a lot of gratification working in Boston the results and challenges continued to grow.  After he dedicated a few years of service in Boston Gregg felt the winds of change start to blow in a new direction.  Gregg moved back to Western Massachusetts where he found another rewarding position supervising at a residential youth detention facility (\u201807).\u003cbr\u003eDuring his experience at the center Gregg came to the realization of how desperately youth needed something to grasp onto.  Furthmore Gregg also became a case worker for an Intensive Foster Care Agency which presented him with unique opportunity to attended a school meeting with an Automotive Shop teacher.  Right then and there Gregg had an epiphany \u201cMy dream job is to be an auto shop teacher.\u201d It would be a true blend of both of Gregg\u2019s life passions.  It took some time to build up the nerve to take the plunge, however soon after he enrolled in a year-long automotive vocational program called Porter and Chester Institute for the sole purpose of becoming an Auto Shop Teacher.\u003cbr\u003e",
