    "summary": "\"One of a kind paper model coming to life thanks to the careful mix of engineering and art\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alejandro and papermodels and crafts have been my passion for the past 20 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy all types of subjects when it comes to Paper modeling. The ones that I am focusing on right now is a series of dinosaur models 5 in total. 2 of them are finished and 3 are on various design stages. the second series I\u0027m working on is a Hollywood Wheels series including the war rig from mad max fury road and the Delorean time machine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow... because all the design work I do is in the computer all my models are scalable and can be applied in different types of projects.... my future goal is to get a 3d printer so that I can also offer 3d printed models.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see my models are not simple blocky things. As a visual artist and perfectionist I made sure that my models are as good as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m offering and paper models in many different formats the first a digital copy that will allow you to print your own version including step by step instructions to build your static model. The models are perfect for displaying at home at school or even a museum.  The instruction are completely visual and easy to follow...But that\u0027s not all the static model is just the beginning of this adventure... I am now working on a fully movable prototype that when finish will get you your own little part of natural history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BuM7lj3pb-o\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal\u00a0 is to deliver a fully finished paper automata that will allow you to have a recreation of the walk cycle of this amazing creature in your own living room.\u003cbr\u003eyou can check some of my work Including my latest design which will be in auction soon.... a certain movie vehicle made entirely from paper..... the best model available right now on any medium.
