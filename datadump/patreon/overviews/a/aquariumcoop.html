    "summary": "Thank you to all the supporters of Aquarium Co-Op. I hope to start a movement where viewers of fish youtube content support 3 youtube channels with Patreon. I present you the $1 Patreon campaign.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you the viewer were to pledge $1 per month to three creators. You\u0027d enable them to create. $12 a year, the price of one Movie Ticket in exchange for many many hours of targeted content for the fish hobby.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany youtubers are worried about ad rates and income to support their channel. For some a little goes a long way to helping them create more content. For others there may be costs of travel or editors, equipment, child care while shooting a video etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor my channel, I have a video editor, and 8 other employees who help keep the channel running. Whether the editor is working on a video, or another employee is answering questions on Facebook. Another employee is creating content on Instagram, meanwhile another employee is working in the retail store so that I can do a live stream and help people each Sunday.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure some are skeptical the money won\u0027t make channels any better. That is the beautiful part of Pateon. You can choose to stop supporting a creator. I can only imagine what I could do with the extra funds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow not all creators need the same things. Perhaps $500 worth of support per month to a creator allows them to quit a part time job and do youtube. Or perhaps it buys the camera and editing computer a 15 yr old youtuber creator needs to move forward in a career of entertainment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I do know is, $1 per month would outweigh all the revenue from ads by far for creators. With the majority of people using ad block, this is a simple way to say \"thank you, keep making content I enjoy\" at an affordable price for a lot of the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that with a minimal sacrifice we can vastly improve the quality of the fish youtube community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
