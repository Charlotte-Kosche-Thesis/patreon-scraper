That\u0027s why I pour so much of myself into AgAuCu - if I can stick with this, pushing myself to create more beautiful pieces and to inject more of my passions into my work, then maybe I can become happier with myself.",

     "description": "A \u003cstrong\u003egiveaway\u003c/strong\u003e! This will be open to all of my Patreons, from the $1 tier up, as a thank you for supporting me and my jewelry and this Patreon journey. The reward will be two pieces of jewelry - either a necklace and earrings, two pairs of earrings, or two necklaces, to be discussed with the winner. I could also try making bracelets, but then the winner would end up with experiments, so... that\u0027s really up to you. Let\u0027s band together and do this!",
