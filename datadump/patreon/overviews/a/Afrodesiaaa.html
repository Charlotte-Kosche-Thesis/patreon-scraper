    "summary": "I am a dreamer who has difficulty gaining access to things I need. This is a thing I am working on; enter: Patreon. Patreon will allow me to unlock the full potential of my vision.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a creator. I create poetry, written pieces and safe spaces for Black and brown people to gather, create and love on each other and ourselves. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating takes love, but it also takes time and energy. I am so grateful for the way my life has moved these past six months. I have opened up my sphere to find a Portland which is teeming with creative melanated potential and it is my current quest to add to it, build it up and show it off. I am joined by a contingent of melanated warriors working to carve out spaces in Portland and within ourselves to make room for our magic.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so blessed to have people in my life raising me up, sharing my writing, my work, and the spaces I help to create. There is only more to come.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth my writing and the creating of BloodLetting, (a poetry night focused on lifting up and amplifying the voices of Queer and Femme people of color,) began in dark spaces. Spaces of sadness and desperation and pain. Spaces of needing release and freedom. Now, I want to lift BloodLetting and my writing into the light. I have goals, and goals take time, energy and love. Thank you to everyone who has raised me up. Thank you for everyone who has showed up. Thank you to everyone who has taken a call after midnight or held me tightly as I wept. I could not make this journey without you. I am grateful for you, inspired by you, and create for you and for myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are interesting times we are living in fam. We need to hold each other. Love one another.\u00a0 Create, manifest and dream together. Come, dream with me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***BloodLetting image credit: Daniel Minter"
