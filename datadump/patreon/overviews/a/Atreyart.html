    "summary": "A little art a day keeps the mundane life away.\u003cbr\u003eI used to create art to escape my reality. I now create to share my reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eI have a great love for music and enjoy creating works that represent a song stuck in my head or sometimes  in my heart. If you have a song that you love and want it seen come alive as a painting, make a pledge and you will have it on your wall.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy true passion for art started at a young age, but\u00a0due to lack of confidence and need to survive I let my one true joy slip from my hands. Thanks to my mom I went through a period of time in the late 90s early 2000s of creating a ton of art. I loved drawing with her, we would spend hours sitting on her bed, drawing pads on laps, coffee in hand, and a big pile of colored pencils between us. unfortunately life got in the way again and I didn\u0027t even pick up a pen or brush for years. It was not till 2010 that my true self would emerge and AtreyArt would\u00a0be born. the one thing that still held true was my sicknesses, both physical\u00a0and emotional and inability to create the way a healthy fit artist can. At that point I started\u00a0 creating\u00a0 art related\u00a0to\u00a0Fibromyalgia, a misunderstood and under-Researched disease.\u003cbr\u003eRecently I\u0027ve started breaking away from only pain art and opening up myself to share my world and the world I see around me. \u003cbr\u003eI want to always be an advocate  for my fellow sufferers  but also want to create joy in those who find the time to appreciate my art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCreating art is and has been painful and difficult, but pain\ndoes not and will not stop me.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI use my art to be a voice for those who suffer from\nFibromyalgia and other \u201cinvisible\u201d illnesses. But, I also use art to keep\nmyself sane. You can see that in my creations, which range from showcasing my\npainful past to present plight.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy hope is my art helps to educate, enlighten, and share the\nhuman experience; to reflect the suffering of those afflicted with disease,\ndisability, and mental pain; while reflecting the mysterious beauty of Mother\nNature.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFrom Metro news May 2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs an artist, Erica Atreya has taken a lot of inspiration\nfrom Frida Kahlo quotation: \u003cstrong\u003eI am not\nsick, I am broken. But I am happy as long as I can paint.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt\u0027s this bitter-sweet, multi-layered complexity that drives\nAtreya\u0027s own work. Her paintings are rich in color and utilize fluid motions,\nbut she paints surreal images that connote a duality of emotions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThey evoke sadness and joy, frustration and exuberance,\nanger and acceptance.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHer characters-usually people and/or animals have a\nfamiliarity to them, but are warped and distorted in gorgeous ways.\u003cstrong\u003e ~Aaron Carnes~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
