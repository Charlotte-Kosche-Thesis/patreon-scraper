     "about": "Anthony Caulkins leads an eclectic musical life as a composer, \nguitarist, and technologist based in Southern California. Through his \ncompositions, Anthony explores questions relating to gesture, \nmodularity, and metaphorical representation. Over his career as a \ncomposer, Anthony has developed a voice that focuses on both intricate \nsystems and improvisatory practices. Combining the sound worlds of both \nacoustic and electronic instruments in his compositions, Anthony invents\n ideas to resonate with audiences of all types. His pieces have been \nperformed internationally, with premieres in the United States, Italy, \nThe Netherlands, and Spain. Anthony\u2019s most recent project is a solo \nelectronic rock show, that uses interactive technologies, for real-time \nbeats, textures, and effects \u2013 \u003ca href=\"https://anthonycaulkins.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-a-new-era\"\u003eSongs For A New Era\u003c/a\u003e\nAlong with composing, \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnthony is a frequent performer of both written\n and improvised music. He is a versatile guitarist who has years of \nexperience in solo, chamber, and orchestral contexts. In the last few \nyears, he has spent time exploring chamber, free improvised, and jazz \ncontexts. Beyond this, Anthony is a frequent pit orchestra musician in \nthe Los Angeles area. Anthony studied classical guitar with Professor \nJavier Calderon and jazz performance with Professor \u003ca href=\"http://music.arts.uci.edu/faculty/kei-akagi\"\u003eKei Akagi\u003c/a\u003e. Currently, Anthony is a member and co-founder of three bands: \u003ca href=\"https://coyotethemist.bandcamp.com/releases\"\u003eCoyote The Mist\u003c/a\u003e, a creative improvisation duo; \u003ca href=\"https://therealpretenders.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eThe Real Pretenders\u003c/a\u003e, a dark indie duo; and \u003ca href=\"https://glit.bandcamp.com/\"\u003eGLIT\u003c/a\u003e, an industrial hip-hop group.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs a technologist, Anthony explores various modes of expression \nthrough the use of interactive computer systems for improvisation. \nRecently, Anthony has begun working on an algorithm for an autonomous \ncomputer improviser whose basic method of understanding music is \ngestural. This computer performer has had multiple performances, most \nnotably in Anthony\u2019s MFA thesis recital, \u003cem\u003eE-Motions (what about gesture?)\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnthony completed his M.F.A. in \u003ca href=\"http://music.arts.uci.edu/icit/\"\u003eIntegrated Composition, Improvisation, and Technology\u003c/a\u003e at the University of California \u2013 Irvine, where he studied with with \u003ca href=\"http://music.arts.uci.edu/dobrian/\"\u003eChristopher Dobrian\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://nicolemitchell.com/\"\u003eNicole Mitchell\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.lukasligeti.com/\"\u003eLukas Ligeti\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://kojiroumezaki.com/\"\u003eKojiro Umezaki\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://mdessen.com/\"\u003eMichael Dessen\u003c/a\u003e.\n Prior to his masters studies, Anthony received his Bachelor of Music in\n Composition at the University of Wisconsin \u2013 Madison, where he studied \nwith Professors \u003ca href=\"http://www.stephendembski.com/\"\u003eStephen Dembski\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.lauraschwendinger.com/\"\u003eLaura Schwendinger\u003c/a\u003e.",
