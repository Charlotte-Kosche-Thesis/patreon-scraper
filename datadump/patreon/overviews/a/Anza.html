I\u0027m Anza!\u003c/strong\u003e Mostly known as Anzadesu via Twitter and other social media sites. I\u0027m a creative enthusiast interested in a wide array of hobbies- painting, drawing, photography, videography, crafts, sewing, cosplay, video games, books, dancing, and even singing... albeit badly ^^;;\u00a0\u266b\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m always coming up with new ideas and ways to innovate and further my creative skills!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HH7Dwpc.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve always loved art. And I do mean \"art\" as a whole! Anything creative has always drawn me in and inspired me to great lengths in so many ways. I\u0027ve been drawing since I can remember and never plan to stop. It\u0027s not only an outlet for my emotions and thoughts but also something I love using to exercise my mind! I always want to try new techniques and tools but still find I predominantly draw with a good ol\u0027 pencil.\u00a0I\u0027m working towards saving up for a drawing tablet though to be able to produce digital art to my heart\u0027s content!\u003cbr\u003e\n(\u003cem\u003eIf you\u0027d like to donate directly to any supplies I\u0027m looking to get you can always send me Amazon gift cards or purchase them directly\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.com/w/3O8PINT07FIJR\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003evia my wishlist\u003c/a\u003e!\u003c/em\u003e)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/N1BVsLy.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve also begun to teach myself how to create vector art! I LOVE it so much and am having a lot of fun working through things. I mostly create these to upload to sites such as Redbubble and Society6 so other\u0027s can purchase them on products :) A stretch goal of mine is to do the same with some of my much more detailed pieces in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wH4nXra.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eCosplay has been a passion of mine since 2003\u003c/em\u003e and has become something I love very dearly as well. I have made some of the best of friends and amazing memories with so many people that I\u0027m not sure who I\u0027d be today without it and the wonderful community surrounding it!\u003cbr\u003e\nAs of now I work a crazy full time graveyard schedule that leaves me with very little free time or extra funding to pursue all my passions and create the content I truly want to and know I can make. I\u0027m seeking out using Patreon as a means to help me be able to spend the time I need creating; as well as the wonderful support I know I will get from everyone here \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDonations will be used to \u003cstrong\u003epurchase material costs for projects and possibly to pay my bills. So I can focus on creating content for you!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThis will include such things as fabric, notions, paper, pens, pencils, and eventually such things as Copics, cameras, and hopefully further down the line a drawing tablet. I may also eventually use it to travel to conventions and events to meet anyone and everyone whom would want to meet me. But \u003cstrong\u003efor now I want to focus on the creation aspect\u003c/strong\u003e more!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreons will have exclusive access to tons of \u003cem\u003ebehind-the-scenes\u003c/em\u003e works when it comes to my \u003cstrong\u003ecosplays, drawings, videos, and overall life!\u003c/strong\u003e You\u0027ll also be helping me choose what projects to work on next and have a hand in the direction that my creations go! I\u0027ll be asking for opinions on everything from what to make next, what fabrics or wigs you think looks best, opinions and art pieces and so much more. Think of it as a sort of \"choose your own adventure\"; Where YOU will have input in the outcome.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAs of now I can\u0027t offer the best of rewards due to my own time constraints as is. I truly wish I could offer so much more as far as physical gifts and thank yous go! I do hope to level up the rewards for everyone in amazing ways as my following grows! But as for now I want to do the best I can to focus on creating content instead of spending all day at the post office :(\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for checking out my Patreon!\u00a0\u2665\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eIf you\u0027d like to find me elsewhere:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://anzadesu.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlog\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/anzadesu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/anzadesu/profile\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitch!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AnzaCosplay\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFacebook\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/Anza\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYoutube\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.redbubble.com/people/anzadesu\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRedbubble\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://society6.com/anza\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSociety6\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://oyamaanza.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDeviantArt\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWishlists:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u25ba\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.sockdreams.com/wishlist/index/index/wishlist_id/108915/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSock Dreams\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
