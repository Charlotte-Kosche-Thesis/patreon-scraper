There will be no nudity, but the content is suggestive.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Amaranth, and there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ve found this page because you know of me through my art (\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://lady-amaranthine.tumblr.com/\"\u003etumblr here\u003c/a\u003e (nsfw),\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ladyamaranth\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eart Patreon here\u003c/a\u003e). For some time now I\u0027ve loved the idea of getting into pinup-style photos and general naughtiness more seriously instead of just random pictures posted over on my tumblr. So this Patreon is designed to make that wish a reality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow it works -\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I\u0027ll be releasing a \u0027set\u0027 of images, either in undies or some other risque state of undress, similar to the posts previously seen on my tumblr which will be available in a GoogleDrive for all patrons. Generally these will involve different poses/clothes/glasses on or off, that sort of thing. I cannot state this enough though, \u003cstrong\u003eI will not be posting nudes on this account\u003c/strong\u003e so please don\u0027t ask for them! This is for pinups, cute but sexy poses and general titillation, nothing more. \u003cstrong\u003eAnyone who harasses me for nudes or sends me sexually explicit messages will be blocked and you will not receive a refund on whatever pledges have processed.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards Explained-\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I\u0027m only offering small pledges because I\u0027m still figuring this whole thing out.

Eventually I want to start seriously looking at cosplay and my own roleplays of characters, which means getting wigs, better makeup, all that jazz.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne day, when I\u0027m less stupid about technology, I\u0027d like to start livestreaming or making vlogs, but that\u0027s something for the future!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~~~\u003c/div\u003eThanks so much for looking and please remember to be respectful.
