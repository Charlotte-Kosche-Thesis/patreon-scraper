    "summary": "Hello everyone! Thanks so much for checking out my Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen people ask me what I do, I always have to take a step back and think about how to answer that question. I guess the best answer is \"anything I can.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am a conservationist. I work at the Amphibian Foundation, a nonprofit tackling the global amphibian crisis. I also volunteer my time with several conservation groups, such as the Turtle Conservancy, theTurtleRoom, \u0026amp; the Georgia Reptile Society to help with their social media pages and with various field work throughout the year. All of that, in addition to my own educational social media, animal rescue, field surveys, and article writing. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI take on a lot, and it\u0027s not easy, but I can\u0027t imagine my life without it. Sometimes it holds me back from living a certain kind of life, because I\u0027ve come to terms with the fact that I was born on this planet at this time when it needs us now more than ever to save it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are in the midst of the 6th mass extinction event our planet has seen! The last time we lost species at such an accelerated rate? 65 million years ago, during the Cretaceous Extinction, and this time, WE are the asteroid. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we also have a chance to help. Conservation is one of the most important things anyone on Earth can be contributing to. The species we are pushing towards extinction are VITAL to the balance of our planet, and we will ultimately suffer if they are lost. Sadly, conservation is a very difficult path for anyone to take, both emotionally, physically, and financially. It\u0027s not easy for a conservationist to make a living, and that deters a lot of people from making conservation their career. It\u0027s pressing, because right now we need more conservationists than ever before, but people just aren\u0027t willing to sacrifice their lives for it. I get that. I am never going to give up on conservation, but I am definitely struggling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work SO hard every single day to do everything I can for animals and conservation-- usually just one educational Instagram story takes me two hours! An article about a conservation issue can take up to five. I am determined to do whatever I can with this life I\u0027ve got, while getting my messages out others, and I hope to reach my fellow warriors in a positive, empowering and hopeful way that will give them the tools to spread the word so that we can assemble an entire generation of people who love, appreciate and aspire to protect the incredible creatures we share our world with. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? In addition to being able to support what I do to create important, meaningful content AND the conservation work I do out in the field, you\u0027ll be able to join an even more close-knit community here of animal lovers, keepers, and savers. I can\u0027t always answer all the questions I get on my Instagram or other platforms, but Patrons will get one-on-one access to me whenever they need to chat! In addition to more content, more pictures, updates and lots of goodies! Thank you so much!!\u003cbr\u003e"
