Our goal is to tell tales that challenge what\u2019s possible in sonic storytelling, and that couldn\u2019t be told in any other medium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn March 2016, we launched Archive 81 \u2014 our very first project. In the short time since, we\u2019ve been featured in\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/30/weeks-best-podcasts-you-must-remember-this-embedded-radiolab\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Guardian\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/05/this-week-in-podcasts-june-1/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWIRED\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.avclub.com/detail/2-dope-queens-and-melanin-millennials-address-race-235071\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe A.V. Club\u003c/a\u003e, multiple iTunes editors\u2019 lists, and an array of newsletters and fan sites. We\u2019ve also been lucky to find a dedicated following of people who are just as hungry for innovative audio storytelling as we are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, we\u0027ve launched a second original podcast, The Deep Vault, as well as started the second season of Archive 81. Both of these projects have been helped A LOT by your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are we working on?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re releasing new episodes of Archive 81, and we\u0027re in the planning stages of our next podcast, which we\u0027re really excited to share with you. (Here\u0027s a hint, it\u0027s going to feature demons, indie bands, and lots of original music) We\u2019re also coming up with weird/wonderful/scary/transcendent ideas for new projects that you\u0027ll love. We need you to make all of these things happen!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Make a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArchive 81\u2019s first season was a labor of love, long skype calls, claustrophobic bedroom-recording sessions and intensive, monastic editing marathons. We funded the entire process out-of-pocket while\u00a0juggling day jobs, freelance work and many other outside commitments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we started getting support on Patreon... we\u0027re still\u00a0juggling day jobs, freelance work and many other outside commitments. But funding our projects has gotten a lot easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListener support allowed us to make The Deep Vault and the second season of Archive 81 weirder, longer, more immersive, and far more entertaining. It lets us\u00a0hire more actors, pay them fairly, and work faster and more efficiently in bringing you an unparalleled storytelling experience. We\u2019re able to book studio time, cover our site and RSS hosting costs, and hire help for the things we can\u2019t do all on our own, like original artwork and graphic design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther support lets us continue to do those things, and it lets us expand our operations, tell more audio stories, and create more ambitious podcasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, we have many more projects that we\u2019re dying to share with the world, and listener support will help us to get them out to you much faster than we could otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You\u2019ll Get\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to a general fuzzy sense of goodwill you\u2019ll get to funding great audio drama, we have a lot of rewards for our patrons, including:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn exclusive, patrons-only Q\u0026amp;A podcast in which the Dead Signals team answers all of your questions, big and small.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWallpapers, sound effects, gifs, and other exciting digital assets.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA ten-episode audio drama.
