First of all, I guess I should give you an idea of who I am. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a neurodiverse, disabled, queer, trans artist. Because of my disabilities I can\u0027t work, so I\u0027m relying on a pension and this.\u003cbr\u003e I use they-them pronouns, and I\u0027m definitely in social justice circles when I can be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpeaking of being an artist, the art I do is a combination of monsters, animals, people, and other fantasy and anthro races. \u003cbr\u003eMonsters are really where my skill lies, and I\u0027ll be putting out a zine hopefully this year called Bramble\u0027s Bestiary, but I\u0027m always happy to work on other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of what you see here on my Patreon will be lineart and sped up videos of my art in progress, with commentary and soft music. Painted and coloured work is usually commissioned, and with the client\u0027s permission it might turn up here even if I don\u0027t upload it elsewhere - you may even see some of it in my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m always open to new work, and the details for that can be found at addertwist hyphen draws dot tumblr dot com.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d love if you considered supporting me - there are rewards listed on the right, starting at three dollars, and this money helps me get my fiancee closer and helps supply me with valuable art resources, like video editing software and maintenance of my tablet\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eI think that\u0027s all I had to cover - thank you for your time, and feel free to contact me with questions or for quotes. \u003cbr\u003eHave a great day!\u003cbr\u003e"

It can be work-safe or not, anthro or not, whatever you like! I\u0027m open to at least attempt any fetish stuff, too, but I\u0027m also happy to draw fanart, original characters, you name it.\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is on top of the previous rewards!\u003cbr\u003e\nPlease note: this is a discount price from my normal commissions, as a piece of clean lineart takes at least 2.5 hours. c: If your piece is simple, I can add colour!",
