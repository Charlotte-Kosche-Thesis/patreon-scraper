My name is Angela. I am a North Carolina based Ukulele player, cosplayer, indie film maker, and geek of all trades! I love music, especially from my favorite anime, games, and movies. I love creating music videos incorporating those pieces, as well as original Ukulele pieces. I also love cosplaying, and have been making costumes for over 17 years for conventions and photo shoots, so incorporating that into my music videos seems pretty ideal to me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v445/Bella_23/20772005_10103204911458791_286811167_o.jpg?t=1502157709\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhy Am I On Patreon:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eMy goal here is to be able to create more high quality music videos and content and to get to know all the people who like my music and costuming and for you to get to know a little more about me! I\u0027ll be posting a lot of behind the scenes videos from music video shoots and cons. You will also get to see a lot of new cosplay photoshoots of costumes used in music videos. I am also bringing a few of my other loves into this page with my cute little Ukulele Pug art (which you can get on a few of my Tiers). Lastly,\u00a0I\u0027ll be asking my Patreon\u0027s to help me choose my next videos, so you will get a say in some of the music I arrange and release.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v445/Bella_23/20707542_10103205008095131_1003759594_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eWhat You Will Get From Me:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI am excited to offer exclusive content to my Patreon feed such as the aforementioned behind the scenes videos and photos from music video shoots, conventions, and other crazy Ukulele and cosplay adventures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI will release Ukulele Music videos every other month (so Jan, March, May, July, etc.) Other than myself I have two regular team members who help me out and keep me sane on set!
