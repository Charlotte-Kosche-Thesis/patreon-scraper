Like many of my generation, I have grown up around games - I\u0027ve played \u003cem\u003eSMITE\u003c/em\u003e since closed beta, \u003cem\u003eLeague of Legends\u003c/em\u003e since Season 3 and am currently playing \u003cem\u003eOverwatch \u003c/em\u003eprimarily.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am creating this patreon as I am noticing more and more people financially supporting my channel as they are enjoying either content or my community. Patreon allows me to recognise those who support my channel more clearly, and in addition give them greater rewards for those that donate. This kind of support is above and beyond what I had ever expected and as I had always said on stream I never want to make money the focus of my content. Donation numbers have never been visible on stream overlays, I don\u0027t charge anything for coaching from anyone on our coach team and never restricted the ability for people to join in sub games or activities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, if you\u0027re still reading up to here and still are okay parting with your money to support my endeavours, I cannot thank you enough - I\u0027ve been astounded and overwhelmed by the continuing support. It\u0027s you - all of you - that drive me to continue my content and make it better each time I do. I hope that can be seen, no matter what I create.\u003cbr\u003e"
