Inspired by channels like Corridor Digital, Rocketjump and AndrewMFilms (NukaZooka), we want to create awesome stuff and blow some minds.

Every video we make costs us about $ 250-500, and we\u0027re currently paying for this out of our own pockets. And that\u0027s fine, we love doing what we do! But unfortunately, that also means that we can\u0027t make videos as often - or as big - as we want to. Patreon will help us fund our videos, allow us to get better equipment, film at epic locations and much, much more. In a time where short-form video is dying and content like vlogs and challenges are becoming increasingly popular, we need your help more than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/yKuP8p0.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8Lpu47p.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe want to make your pledge worthwhile.
