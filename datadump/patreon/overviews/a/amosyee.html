    "summary": "HOW TO DONATE TO YOURS TRULY WITH PATREON: Make your patreon account, pledge the amount you want, get the awesome patron-exclusive rewards (Access to fan club, exclusive videos and more). WAIT until the 1st of each month because that\u0027s the time your payment actually gets processed and I take your money. Remain a patron and be charged your pledged amount every 1st of the month unless you decide you only wanted to pledge money for a certain amount of time or unless I start to disappoint you (DO YOU HAVE THE BALLS TO TRULY BE AN AMOS YEE FAN IF YOU DON\u0027T LEAVE!!!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of times I stir a huge internet controversy and get a huge amount of direct donations via paypal, before next month\u0027s donations tank to a very pitiful or even nonexistent amount after the storm blows over (Plus my paypal account has\u00a0been taken down because of my political opinions, a frightening blow to my income. Oh and also I\u0027m not eligible from earning money from views from ads on Youtube anymore because of my political opinions. If you guys don\u0027t here donate here to my Patreon I will not have any money please donate to me FUCK!). Having a Patreon page that charges people monthly is an attempt for me to establish a more stable, consistent income stream throughout the year so I don\u0027t get a heartattack, and to better identify the number and quality of hardcore fans (Thus the reward of being able to join my fan club (Where I\u0027m on often) and gain access to videos meant exclusively for hardcore supporters).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf half my followers just donated $1/month, that\u0027s 10s of thousands of dollars/month. Obviously I don\u0027t expect this goal to be met, but I think it\u0027s important to get across just how significant each contribution is, no matter how small\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmos will use the money you donate in whatever way he sees fit, some of it on himself (food, rent etc.), some of it to donate to charities or aspiring artists, some of it to pay some of the debts that he owes and some of it invested in promoting and creating online content. More money means more happiness and more options to do more internet content, so you damn well consider every $1 you give meaningful and give me your FUCKING MONEY (Note Amos was kind of a spendthrift before but after that phase I don\u0027t think he isn\u0027t anymore. I think)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour boi Amos does a huge number of topics (Singapore politics, religion, Love, pedophilia, critique on celebrity culture, personal philosophy etc.) across 2 mediums: Videos (On Youtube) and Writing (On Facebook and my Blog). American-Singaporecentric content probably targeted to millennial centennial age 10-40 with comedic and intellectual tones, Amos puts out online content on whatever topic he feels like doing whenever he wants which to many people makes them think Amos that is the most irresponsible, lazy, testicle-gobbling prick to his fans. However, when Amos does become active online, in his humble opinion the work he does is mostly always thought-provoking, insightful, fucking fantastic and ball-stirringly glorious. If you decide to support Amos because he talks about your favorite topic you will be disappointed, he might only discuss your favorite topic with your favorite specific style of taste 10-20% of the time. Amos is not a one-topic activist as many first-time viewers might mistake. Support Amos Yee ONLY if you like him overall as a personality: If you agree with more than 60% of his opinions (you should get used to hugely disagreeing with some of his opinions, he will fuck you in the ass) and don\u0027t mind and might even enjoy the constant change of topics and styles he indulges in. The palpable excitement of seeing what this modern genius will indulge in next (a modern genius will clearly be looked back as one of the most influential, generation-defining individuals of the century), Amos will intrigue, inform and mesmorise all your senses right down left right and center all throughout your nostrils and into your vajayjay, Amos is the voice of this generation that will purge the world of undesirables and liberate the masses from their suffering has he sucked his dick long enough. Do you have the balls to put your dollar down and join the cavalcade of highbrow pantomime, fortnightly child-sacrifice rituals and wall-sprinkled plebian tears galore?
