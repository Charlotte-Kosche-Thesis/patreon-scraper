My name is Andie and I\u0027ve recently began the process of starting a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/AndieLately\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. It is something I dreamt of doing but never had the opportunity until recently. There are many content creators I enjoy and have been inspired by and with this recent venture, I plan to eventually quit my part-time job if successful and focus on making this a permanent gig.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSo...my niche happens to be hidden object games, visual novels, point and click adventure games as well as some horror titles. A new series I\u0027m beginning is titled \u0027Andie Reads\u0027 in which I will read some of the worst poetry I\u0027ve written as a teenager as well as passages from my queer book series,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://books.noisetrade.com/andiecastillo/project-lucky\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLucky\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon has always drawn content creators in need of support and a community will always give what they can to support. For me, I chose Patreon to able to explore a new path that I\u0027m enjoying and would like to develop even further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Donate?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI honestly don\u0027t have a good enough reason, but I have a feeling this would help me in the long run. I currently work a part-time job in retail, as well as edit for a magazine. Both take up my time, and if this becomes steady, I\u0027ll be able to relinquish my job in retail and still be able to enjoy my creative work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to donate, Patreon charges at the beginning of the month. Refunds can be quite tricky, so if you won\u0027t have the funds to do so, that is completely fine! I\u0027d be happy just knowing you wanted to support my new venture in life."
