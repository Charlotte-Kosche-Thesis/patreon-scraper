I just assumed I\u0027d go on making YouTube a part-time\u00a0gig until the day I died but when I had some life changes earlier this year I realized... I might just be able to do this full time if I can be smart about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 So here we are. I\u0027m coming to you asking you if my contribution to your life is worth a dollar or two a month. Some of the greatest contributors of society had patrons providing backing but... I\u0027m not them I\u0027m a guy making silly internet videos that wants to focus on that full time. If that\u0027s worth it to you I\u0027d like to invite you to help fund my dream of making silly internet videos that entertain, educate, explore, and appreciate the world around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 My intention is to continue creating Travel vlogs, However, I anticipate that it will take some time to get back to that point. That means that when I move back to the U.S. I will be on a limited budget and focusing on a slightly different type of travel vlogs focusing on more every day destinations that one may find in rural America. From there I\u0027m hoping to grow this to a point where I can provide valuable insight into the world while putting it through the filter that my audience has come to know and identify with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
