Thanks for visiting my Patreon page!! Patreon is like an \u003cstrong\u003eonline tip jar\u003c/strong\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e or ongoing kickstarter program\u003c/strong\u003e, that you can use to \u003cstrong\u003ehelp support the artists you love.\u003c/strong\u003e As a musician, the music I make takes upwards of 40 hours for an electronic song, and upwards of 100 hours for an orchestral one. Working on music is so time consuming I don\u0027t get much time for much else :P Though in times of musical creative dry spells, I also work on art and drawing of cartoons and comics\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy content is still free!!!\u003c/strong\u003e This just allows my fans to help me out a bit and show their appreciation in a completely 100% optional way \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me, you\u0027ll be helping fund \u003cstrong\u003enew projects such as prints, paying for singers, and hiring musicians\u003c/strong\u003e. Of course, as well as living expenses such as internet and stuff.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eEvery bit helps \u003c/strong\u003eif you\u0027re in a position to share any funds, and even if you\u0027re not able to share funds, sharing my music, art, or patreon helps too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t believe in piracy, and as such have bought all of my software with my own money. I\u0027ve spend more on the software and hardware I need than I think I\u0027ll be able to make back by making music, all with the goal of being able to create the things I love and things that other people can enjoy. That\u0027s why I\u0027ve set up this patreon page, so that I can \u003cstrong\u003eoffset the cost of what I had to spend to get to this point \u003c/strong\u003e:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for taking the time to read, and as always, I hope you have a fantastic day \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(If you have ideas on things to include as rewards, leme know! Rewards are sent out at the beginning of each month after pledges go through :\u0026gt; )"
