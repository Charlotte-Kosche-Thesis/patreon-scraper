My dream is to one day figure out how to draw. Meanwhile, I\u0027m doing the mom thing, the work thing, the laundry thing, and scrambling to put out my weekly strip. Who says you can\u0027t have it all? #modernwoman\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Monday comic (currently \"Aurora Ridge\") will always be available for any weary traveler of the interwebz, but I have SO MANY more ideas and projects I am dying to work on.  That\u0027s where my Patrons come in.\u00a0 With your support I can do even more! Like write a graphic novel... right after I figure out how to draw.\u003cbr\u003e"
