    "summary": "Hello there! \u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alex and I am a twenty four old dude from Germany. \u003cstrong\u003eHallo! Guten Tag!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eFirst of all, thank you for taking your time to read this! \u003cbr\u003eNow here are a few things you should know about me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI loved writing stories since first grade, writing little scribbles as well. \u003cbr\u003eThe first story I ever wrote was in 5th grade because I was writing for a newsletter in school. The story became popular and so I continued with writing short stories etc. \u003cbr\u003eIn 7th grade I finally wrote a big story of a young girl who found herself in a different world (yeah... kind of like Narnia, I know). The story or rather, the book had about four hundred (!) pages handwritten. But some bullies in my school stole it and burned everything down. This affected me a lot, resulting in me being disencouraged because someone had destroyed something I created, something I was very proud of. I stopped writing because of that.\u003cbr\u003eBut last year I had an idea and now I want to start writing again. I want to share the idea with you! I love writing stories, creating characters and plots! This is my world and I won\u0027t give that up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e, dear reader, can help me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are not forced to donate me, but it would be a huge favor if you could share my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003ePlease share this with people who love books and stories as well!\u003cbr\u003eI know I can do it, with your help. \u003cbr\u003eYou keep me motivated to try again what I\u0027ve given up a long time ago and revive my passion of writing and creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT NOW TO THE STORY I GOT IN MY HEAD!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------------\u003cbr\u003eThere are Duster and Penelope, children of the kings family of the Himeutha tribe! They are a tribe hidden in the Underground. The children were promised a land they should reign and they are trying to claim what is theirs. \u003cbr\u003eBut the conditions are worse than they thought. While the land is run by the Kyros tribe, the air is heavily polluted and it\u2019s hard to survive. The government in Kyros is corrupt and totalitarian. Life is living hell among the people of Kyros. Speaking out your mind is dangerous, and the chances to survive in such filthy air is not very high either. There are cameras in every corner, which can record them to get them punished.\u003cbr\u003eNot everyone on Kyros is happy with the whole situation and now try their best to help the Himeutha tribe to take over the land again. On the other hand, the government of Kyros will try their best to keep the Himeutha away, no matter what it takes.\u003cbr\u003eAnd people of Kyros are missing, while the death rate is increasing. \u003cbr\u003eWhere the missing people are, or how the Himeutha tribe will manage to take back their land, are questions that are yet to be answered. \u003cbr\u003e----------------------\u003cbr\u003eI hope this drew your attention and it would be amazing if you could support me. Even one Euro / Dollar would keep me motivated and happy. It would keep me alive, you would basically make me the happiest person alive!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
