    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! When I started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aaroncake.net/76cosmo/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erestoring my \u002776 Mazda RX-5 Cosmo\u003c/a\u003e in late 2010 and posting the progress to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/aaroncake\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e I had no idea the response I would see. There weren\u0027t too many creators back then showing the grime and sweat of full restorations. But the support and response has been incredible! With over 28,000 subscribers (and counting) and over 8.8 million video views (and counting) it is clear that I\u0027m not the only one sharing in the enthusiasm for this project. The response from viewers with questions, comments, criticisms and support has been outstanding.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://www.aaroncake.net/76cosmo/images/patreon/Sitting_On_Cosmo_Hood.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSince I began this project I have been making steady investments not only in the project itself but also the tools necessary to complete it. Indeed, perhaps the largest tool investment came in the form of a new shop (with included house) I purchased in early 2015 after losing my old shop to the inevitable march of progress saw it torn down to build high rise apartments.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn my videos I\u0027ve often alluded to the fact that this isn\u0027t TV, this is the real world. When the camera turns off, there is no crew stepping in to finish up. It is just me, working evenings and weekends to build a car I can be proud of and enjoy, while sharing that progress with the world. Which means that almost all the free time I can muster after the day job, renovating that aforementioned house, and mundane activities like eating, sleeping and bathroom goes into building the car and editing the resulting footage.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you choose to support me through Patreon you will be contributing to this project and the creation of these videos. By no means will the project end if you choose not to support me, that\u0027s OK too. But I\u0027m hoping that with enough support I can devote more time to building the car and get the videos released more often.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat do you get besides a warm fuzzy feeling inside if you become a patron? Well, I\u0027m thinking you are here because you enjoy my videos, so what you will get is early access to those videos! Let\u0027s say, 1 week before they go public. You can sit back with a cold adult beverage and enjoy the glory of your specialness, knowing you\u0027re part of the select few to witness the welding, grinding, that\u0027s what she said and innuendos 7 days before the rest of the world. Perhaps we can also sweeten the deal even more. Let\u0027s say I have an episode broken into two parts. How awesome would it be as a patron to get immediate access to that 2nd part only days after the first one is posted? Yep, that\u0027s what I\u0027m talking about."
