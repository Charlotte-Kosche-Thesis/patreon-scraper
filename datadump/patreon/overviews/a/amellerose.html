    "summary": "First off... Thank you for even taking the time to read this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Amelle Rose, and I write songs (say whaaaat). A couple of years ago I moved to London from my little French hometown with a suitcase full of hopes and dreams and since then I\u0027ve basically been busting my ass to \u0027make it\u0027. Everything has been going really well so far, much better than I could ever imagine, but it is no secret that the music industry is a tough world that involves a lot of investment financially to get projects going. It took me a lot of saving up to be able to record and release my debut EP, and although things are getting easier as I\u0027m slowly getting there, I\u0027m not a full-time musician just yet. A lot of my income is based on general tipping whilst gigging and busking, and because I\u0027d really like to concentrate on my singer-songwriter project more, and the internet being such a wonderful place, websites like Patreon allow me to have this sort of tipping scheme in place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"So where will this money go once it reaches your account?\", I hear you ask.\u003cbr\u003eI have personally made the choice to be an independent musician, as the control freak that I am, I\u0027m quite aware that smaller independent record labels won\u0027t bring in much more than I what I\u0027m already capable of doing on my own... apart from a budget I guess. I get to keep my creative freedom, which is great, but unfortunately it has a cost that I can\u0027t provide all by myself. Any money pledged through Patreon will therefore go towards any project I\u0027m looking into doing, whether it be the release of a single, an EP/album, getting a music video done or organising gigs. At the end of the day, you\u0027re basically becoming investors towards my very own record label!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, as an attempt to thank you for helping, I will commit to giving you a minimum of one creation every month ; could be a cover, a demo of an original song, an acoustic version of a fully released and produced track...\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, depending on how much you\u0027d like to pledge, there are another bunch of different things I\u0027m gonna give you guys, going from weekly vlog style updates, handmade postcards or a coffee date!\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll be charged your pledge ONCE a month and you can amend or cancel it anytime you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease do keep in mind that if you can\u0027t afford to help I am still incredibly grateful for you even paying attention to what I do. I can\u0027t ever thank you enough for just listening to my music, it means the absolute world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve got any questions about this whole thing please feel free to tweet me (@amellerose7) or email me at contactamellerose@gmail.com !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you guys join this little club and I\u0027ll talk to you soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmelle x\u003cbr\u003e"
