Having a patreon helps me keep the gaming channel running and putting new content out for you all!

There are easy ways to support me or any other creator you like! The easiest way to support creators is like, comment, and subscribe on YouTube! It helps more people find the photos and by watching ads you are helping us earn ad revenues! Ad revenues cannot be paid out until a creator reachers $100 which can take years for some creators (I\u0027m not even close to this currently!) so every ad you watch helps inch toward that goal!

My therapist says I need to have big goals for myself, so since being married to a literal video game character is impossible, I\u0027m going for the most likely impossible goal of paying my rent with gaming! If I could pay my rent with gaming my second job would be vanquished, I could purchase new editing software to make my videos even better, buy a capture card so I could record throwback PS3 games, and I could get a a new video card and finally join the PC master race! (Don\u0027t worry playstation - I\u0027ll never leave you completely!) I could potentially buy an Xbox and begin playing exclusives, purchase a quality headset so my voice is much clearer, and heck - get a VR headset so I could play all the horrible horror games VR has to offer! This is a pipe dream, one that is nearly impossible to reach, but just like Texas I have decided to go big on this one. If I ever reached this goal I would also have to pledge my heart and soul to every last one of you because it isn\u0027t me who would make this a reality - it would be you guys!",
