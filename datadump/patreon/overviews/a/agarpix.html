    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIn short:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI take photos. This Patreon serves two purposes: (a) support my work as a photographer and (b) support my work as a researcher/inventor. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the end of 2016 I\u0027ve been working on a way to create gelatin-free (and thus vegan) analogue photography. Just about everybody says it can\u0027t be done. I\u0027m pretty sure it can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(Oh yeah, you can follow me on Instagram now: \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/agar_pix\"\u003eAgar_pix\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr\u003e(I also have an Etsy store:\u003ca href=\"http://www.etsy.com/shop/agarpix\"\u003eagarpix\u003c/a\u003e )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been making art in some form for about fifteen years and in that pursuit, as well as living my life in general, there\u0027s a clear pattern of focus - I recycle and reuse absolutely anything I can. I dumpster dive, reuse, reapply, salvage and repair everything. A lot of the time the art is defined by what I can salvage and what I can do with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are literally millions upon millions of working analogue cameras and darkrooms out there, and they\u0027re going begging for a home. In 2016 I was given two boxes of analogue cameras (most rescued from the rubbish) and a share in a darkroom\u0027s worth of developing equipment, I thought, \"Why not?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, because \u003cem\u003enot vegan!\u003c/em\u003e So I decided to work my way around that bit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout the project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy photography generally focuses on obsolete technology, one way or another. I have one \u0027good\u0027 camera (a humble Canon 700D), four or five decrepit digital cameras, about fifteen analogue lenses that have been adapted to fit the 700D, and about a dozen analogue cameras - from box cameras to folding cameras to TLRs to rangefinders to SLRs. The whole gamut. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince early 2016 I\u0027ve been printing anthotypes from digital negatives, making TtV images with the analogue cameras and taking digital photos with analogue lenses, none of which is particularly groundbreaking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings changed when I began looking into making my own photographic paper in November 2016. The research snowballed into learning the history of photography and nineteenth century chemistry. After about two months of experimentation and research, I had a working, coated photographic paper that used agar-agar instead of gelatin that produced good, strong, lasting images. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three stages to this experiment:\u003cbr\u003e(1)\u003c/strong\u003e Make a vegan, coated, photographic paper, that produces an image from a negative, can be developed and fixed. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118, 146, 60);\"\u003e\u0026lt;- Done!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(2)\u003c/strong\u003e Increase the speed of the emulsion to produce photographic paper with an ISO high enough to be used with an enlarger, in a pinhole camera, or in paper-in-camera photography. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(242, 195, 20);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 145, 0);\"\u003e\u0026lt;- Under development!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e(3)\u003c/strong\u003e Take this faster emulsion or adapt it to make a film that can be developed and then used to print photographs on the above paper in a traditional darkroom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere\u0027s the money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money for this Patreon goes towards buying me time away from a crappy job to practice my art and research the project, and to purchasing supplies. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way I\u0027ll be producing prints using the methods I\u0027m developing and playing with, writing up reports on how my progress is going, and sharing that progress with my patrons. You can also follow my work as an artist in vegan mediums like anthotyping, cyanotyping, digital photography and whatever else comes my way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt various reward levels you\u0027ll also be getting different types and sizes of hand-made prints in your mailbox so you can get all touchy-feely with the vegan process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you\u0027re into the idea of vegan analogue photography and have some coin to spare, join up, get some photos sent to you and learn along the way. \u003cbr\u003e"
