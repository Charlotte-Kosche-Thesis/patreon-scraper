Meanwhile, I support the musicians I love and expose them to a wider audience, rather than just playing choons at clubs and bars every weekend mindlessly, in a place where my selection is not entirely of the more mainstream oriented taste. And let\u0027s be honest, the society of the place were I currently live has never truly given electronic music the respect and value it deserves, but I\u0027ve been working behind the decks for nine beautiful years and I\u0027ll never stop keeping it real!!! \u0026gt;:) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been a fan of asking people for money without ensuring they get something in return.

I was really into dj\u0027ing, I was also working as a manager of the Fnoob Trance Channel so I was totally busy with other things, and then, one day in march 2014 Bitwig was released and blam...it was all I\u0027ve ever wanted in a DAW \u0026lt;3 2nd act, I went nuts and embarked upon an endless journey of music and gained massive quantities of knowledge, and after 193 projects that I started I\u0027m definitely certain that now I\u0027ve reached the level I was looking to reach and develop towards, with my specific aesthetic approach to electronic music :D I\u0027m super happy with the results and I am sure what\u0027s coming will be 1000% TIMES BIGGER, BETTER, STRONGER \u0026amp; CHINGON!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor now (lol, I like to experiment with new things all the time so I might do new musical projects if my creative energy demands it) the music that i\u0027m making comes under the names of :\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOrbital Funeral (Psychill / Downtempo/ IDM) [\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/quantum_techno_research/orbital-funeral-anyer-quantum-the-nightmare-has-to-have-nrg-running-out-of-gravity-version\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOrbital Funeral - The Nightmare has to have NRG\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003eSerenade For Replicants (Synthwave/TechNoir) [\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/hornsandhoofs/serenade-for-replicants-rilast/s-V6v1i\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSerenade for Replicants - Relax Dat @$$\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003eAnyer Quantum (Psychedelic Techno) [\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/quantum_techno_research/anyer-quantum-ghastly-deluxe-justified-ancient\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAnyer Quantum - Ghastly Deluxe (Justified \u0026amp; Ancient)\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShaolin Shuffle (Psychedelic Techno/Dark Prog) [\u003ca href=\"https://boshkebeatsrecords.bandcamp.com/track/cyberpunk-abstractions-and-the-biopolitics-of-urban-survival\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShaolin Shuffle - Cyberpunk Abstractions and the Bio-Politics of Urban Survival\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough this expedition I can tackle several goals in one single move : first and foremost I think the most important for me, is to acquire a new level of communication with you...Facebook it\u0027s a bit of a pain in the ass :P I can\u0027t post anything without them asking me to pay 30 dollar ads just to get in contact with you, and here in Patreon I can do wayyy more awesome shit and push things to new audiovisual-experimental territory... Also, I have many many new tracks that haven\u0027t seen the light of day because damn, is it me, or is music getting standardized as fuck? As you can imagine, what I create ain\u0027t truly what common labels are interested to release...But again, with Patreon you can become an extra member of my team, and the music will reach your hands before any of the facebook pages that ask dinero inform you of these things!!! Paying for mastering is probably the first Goal I\u0027ll try to reach, since I have friends that have done it for free all this years but I think they also deserve to be properly compensated\u2026something that I haven\u0027t been able to do because hey, remember the track I made called :\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9q3PwBtUNpY\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e100% Authentic 3rd World Beats\u003c/a\u003e???

I think it\u0027s time to let you know that I\u0027ve been through some not so great health problems, you see, when I made 100% 3rd world beats I was kinda making fun of my broken chair and the lack of space for resting my hands while I write/use the mouse... this situation is causing several problems with my right hand (carpal tunnel... yep, painfull asf#$\"!) / back/ neck and errr other less easy to disclose things :) so I\u0027d love to work on that area first to stay focused in creating beautiful and subversive awesomeness...Only for you ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStarting to DJ / Produce music has been the best decision I\u0027ve made in my life, and I\u0027m really happy with how it\u0027s turned out. And I\u0027m planning for Patreon to be the next big step to get me producing more content, but at a steadier pace that will ensure everything has its own appropriate place and polish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings are looking up!
