Those who understand their past understand their present and are clear about the future. It will allow me to fully concentrate on my research \u2014 such as digging into the roots of world great philosophies and cultures including Native American, Indian, Ancient Russian to name a few; deeper studies of symbols and their impact on our subconscious \u2014 and its implementation in my continuous innovation. I will be able to maintain the rent of my Temple of Art \u2014 my studio at the MANA Contemporary in Jersey City; produce art works, which speak to you of love, life, and this eternal being \u2014 Mankind and all the worries and joys. I will be able to acquire quality art materials in order to continue my numerous projects and use new media to better communicate my ideas.\u003cbr\u003e",
