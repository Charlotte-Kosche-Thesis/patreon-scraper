I also have a love of playing music, and studying ancient languages, such as Latin. \u003cbr\u003eOther fun facts: I am a huge Tolkien nerd; I have a great love for old movies; and I love classic rock, classical music, opera, and many, many other genres.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will find mostly my poetry posted here (or an essay I find particularly good, though this will be less common). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find my other and older works at asiegelster.webs.com. To contact me you can do so through either of those websites, or more directly at asiegelster@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs to why I am on Patreon:\u00a0I write poetry, and I have been writing for as long as I can remember. However, I have never published a piece. I thought that Patreon would be a good place to get my poetry out into the world, and to gain experience of what it is like to have my work read by the public, and to have support for the creations I have put much of my thoughts and soul into making. I also hope that this will encourage me to write poetry more regularly, which I would very much like to do.\u003cbr\u003eI write about nature, about emotions, about what sometimes can be dark subjects. Mostly I try to write what will resonate with myself and with my readers. I write poems of any length, and rhyme and meter appear often in my work. I hope that those of you out there will enjoy reading my work as much as I enjoy creating it."
