Recently I\u0027ve been trying to create longer projects that I think the fandom would enjoy, but animation is a time consuming mistress. Normally I would do personalized commissions to supplement my income, but commissioned animations are too expensive, and the more I have to check in with a customer, the slower the process goes. So, instead, I\u0027ve decided to start a Patreon! Your pledges mean that I can focus on creating fun and arousing animated projects that are otherwise hard to come by in the furry fandom!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere are some examples of my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/17022972/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/view/17022972/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/17071408/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/view/17071408/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/view/17154874/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/view/17154874/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q2v_5QpUC8\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Q2v_5QpUC8\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT ARE THE GOALS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I have 2 projects that I would like to complete. The more pledges I get, the more time I can devote to each, and the sooner they can be completed! For each $25 dollars, I will devote AT LEAST an hour\u0027s worth of work. In all likelihood, I will probably spend more time on these things than I get paid for, since I do stumble and slow down here and there, so you\u0027re not likely to get cheated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is possible that pledges may become excessive for the amount of work that I can dedicate to these projects (I do still have a job on the side). If such becomes the case, I will halt the campaign until I feel I can make up for the excess and can add additional hours for new funding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I do have plans for the future, so this campaign may end after a few projects have been completed. Don\u0027t fear though: You might get a chance to support something really big soon...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLinks to content examples will be provided shortly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCONTENT FOR ALL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAll of the projects you help fund on Patreon will be available to the general community (provided you have access to sites like Furaffinity or tumblr). The goal of the Patreon is keep me focused on creating projects that are unique and that everyone can enjoy. It is possible that Patrons will get some perks though, such as being able to suggest what the theme of future projects will be, and even what species should take part in the fun! Sometimes your ideas might be better than mine!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANKS!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everyone that decides to pledge and support me!
