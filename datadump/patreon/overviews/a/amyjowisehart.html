Writing about my experiences are becoming a huge part of my life. Now I\u0027m wanting to move forward and create imagery that can pair with my writings about the struggles as a person in the world. (I also want to be able to travel more so that I can also document other bodies/genders/races of people and listen to what they want or have to say. Inclusivity is incredibly important to me, but as of now I\u0027ve mainly just worked with myself as I am always around. I also live in a super secluded area of Southern Louisiana where there are rarely other creatives around. )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong with working on content about mental health awareness I also work a lot showcasing my own body in ways that allow others to also see beauty in their bodies. I want people to see that just because you don\u0027t look like a \"normal\" or \"ideal\" body that you can be just as beautiful, because dammit, all bodies are good bodies. I try to showcase this in my photography, as well as working in acrylic and watercolor paints.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*Why I need ya*\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon I\u0027m hoping to be able to cover *most* of my bills each month with my first goal. And with this means that I\u0027ll be able to have a *for sure* income each month. And let me tell ya, struggling with mental issues and trying to work for the *man* full time is so incredibly difficult. It leaves me with barely any time to create art on my own. I also don\u0027t have insurance, so any health care that I pay is out of pocket. Sometimes my body will break down and just be like NOPE, you sick. So any, and I mean ANY kind of support for my art work and such will help so so much. It will help me to create more personal artwork, have security, and have the options to travel to others to collaborate.\u00a0"
