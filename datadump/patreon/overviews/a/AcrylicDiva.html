Tesia here.... I\u0027m excited to invite you into my world. It\u0027s a world of inspiration, art, paint, dogs, music and LOVE!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo first, my credentials. I have a BFA and a MA. I\u0027m a Certified Golden Working Artist with extensive acrylic training and I\u0027ve taught for more than 25 years. I\u0027ve exhibited my work for at least that long and have collectors and patrons all over the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay now that we have that out of the way....\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the past 25 years I have taught literally hundreds of people how to access their inner artist. No matter how little time you have, no matter how tiny your painting space is, I\u0027m here to show you how to make it work. I want you to feel the \n\u003cstrong\u003ebliss\u003c/strong\u003e that comes from creating something you love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs you \u00a0may know, every Wednesday at noon (Pacific time) I host a free, live, YouTube hangout. I cover all kinds of topics related to acrylic painting and being a working artist. I want to continue to make the best videos I can. \u00a0And I want to continue to make them \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e. My master plan is to unleash the artist in everyone so come along with me and join the party!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tTo keep making videos I need to \n\t\u003cem\u003ekeep working hard\u003c/em\u003e. That means hours of editing, shooting the videos, painting sample pieces before-hand, creating new content \u003cem\u003eevery week,\u003c/em\u003e purchasing materials and so much more. Your patronage goes a long way to\nhelping me stay engaged with the community that I love so much - and that\u0027s YOU!\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nYour patronage also gives me the great gift of time - time that I can spend painting the rewards for Patrons like yourself; time to answer all of your email questions; time to work on top notch handouts with easy to follow instructions; \u00a0time to create the kind of content you want to see.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nSo come on in! Join me on the journey - see for yourself what goes on in a working artist\u0027s studio - day in and day out.\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd thank you from the bottom of my heart!\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e"
