    "summary": "Hey guys, my\nname is Mat Brunet (or as I call myself when you see me with my orange hat, AniMat) you might know me more for making videos about Animation and\nDisney. What about specifically? Well, this can range from documentaries of the\nbiggest names and studios in animation with \u003cem\u003eAnimation Lookback\u003c/em\u003e, reviews on animated films both old and\nnew with \u003cem\u003eAniMat\u0027s Reviews \u003c/em\u003eand \u003cem\u003eAniMat\u0027s Classic Reviews\u003c/em\u003e, facts about all the characters from the Epic Mickey games with \u003cem\u003eThe Epic Mickey Files\u003c/em\u003e, Top 10 lists\nand many more.

However, this\ngreat growth comes with a price, quite literally in fact. Research material,\nmovie tickets, DVDs and Blu-Rays, props, equipment, the list goes on.  That, and also getting revenue for making\nthese videos isn\u2019t as easy as you\u2019d expect, especially with YouTube\u2019s broken\ncopyright system.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnimation Lookback Example\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wxgc1bB4qAA\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen you pledge a certain\namount for me every month, you\u2019ll earn some cool prizes depending on how much\nyou give, this can range from access to exclusive vlogs, credits at the end of\nmy videos, ask a question I\u2019ll immediately answer on my future update vlogs or\neven request an animated film I WILL do for the next AniMat\u2019s Classic Reviews. \u003cem\u003e(For more info on the rewards, just check\nthe descriptions down below)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAniMat\u0027s\u00a0Reviews Example\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"366\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Gv23srq4xw\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nWhere is the money going to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe money will be going\ntowards the production of my videos as it will help grow both the quality of my\nwork and the community that follows me as well as ways to connect with them.\nWith your help, I\u2019ll be able to get new and better equipment, which will allow\nme to make the projects I\u2019m doing now bigget and better and even able to work\non new projects. \u003cem\u003e(For more info on what\nI\u2019ll do with the money, you can check out the Milestone Goals on the left)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eTop 10 Example\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilt-8Sm_3aw\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"365\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/E1p2QDTM254\" width=\"650\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, with all\nthat said, I hope you can help me out on this journey to see what lies in store\nfor us in the past, present and future of animation.
