Learning\nhow to walk again, and getting excited everyday when she could take 10 more\nsteps than the last is what truly opened Amanda\u2019s eyes up to her future. At\nthat moment, Amanda knew that she wasn\u0027t going to sit around and hope that\nshe\u2019d live her best life....she was going to make sure that it happened. Amanda\nmade it a point to focus more on herself, her health, traveling, and what makes\nher happy and she continues to do just so on this adventure with her boyfriend\nPhil!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPhil\nand Amanda met when Amanda moved back home from WV to NYC after being gone for\nalmost six years.
