That\u0027s the short version. I\u0027m a young Jamaican American Muslim who converted from Christianity a little under a decade ago. Since then I have been dedicated to studying Islam, inculcating its teachings in my life, being a great husband and father, and teaching those around me of the beauty I have found in the religion. I firmly believe that a relationship with the Creator isn\u2019t a\nrelationship to miss out on, and I want the world to know it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve taught about my faith and spirituality through many venues, such as interfaith lectures, and the like. However, my greatest outreach is via social media and my writings.

Lewis and he\u2019s always been an inspiration of mine, I aim to\ncontinue in his footsteps by giving people of faith (and others) stories,\nessays and overall beautiful reflections that they are able to identify with\nand hopefully increase them in adoration and passion for the way of life they\nhave chosen.
