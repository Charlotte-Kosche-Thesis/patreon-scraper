Think of it like paying a subscription where you choose how much the subscription costs. If you\u0027d like to give us $1/month, that\u0027s fine. If you want to give us $5, $10, $25, or whatever amount per month that speaks for you, \u00a0you can do that, too. Payments are automatic for everyone\u0027s convenience. \u00a0You can stop them whenever you want. \u00a0The point is that your ongoing contributions will allow our efforts to be ongoing as well.
