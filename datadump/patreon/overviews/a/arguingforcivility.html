    "summary": "Patrons! Help support civil discourse!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur world probably has about all the partisan opinion we need and then some. The goal here of this stage of my personal journey, my adventure in my life is promoting conversation, not speeches. Analysis more than judgment. Opinion and commentary offered in the spirit of persuasion, argument and even disagreement...without being disagree-able.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have much in the way of any real gift or talent, but I have always been able to come up with an opinion. Politics, sports, human nature and behavior, music, arts, science, philosophy, medicine, you name it and I probably have an opinion or some sort of thoughts and my GOAL is to offer my opinions up to give you, the patron, thoughts to to ponder. To share with you an angle or direction you may not have thought of. A piece of argument to help make a little more sense of the world we live in. And maybe a laugh or two along the way and to always be of some entertainment value.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI claim no real expertise. I do claim 35 some odd years of adult living of life experience, of doing\u00a0 things, success, failures, joy, pain, relationships, kids, siblings, parents, friends. I\u0027ve done a little of a lot of things and a lot of some. The common theme for me has been to try and learn a little as a go, maybe teach a little and always, always developing thoughts and opinions. It has been a great challenge to learn to recognize my own bias and, though still not always successful, to make an argument from a standpoint of reasoned, of understanding as best I can the other side of an argument as well as my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI find myself at 53 coming out of a painful bankruptcy, facing the rest of life wondering what to do now. Well, if there is a plus to failing, it is clarity. I don\u0027t know how many people are actually doing what they\u0027re good at AND want to be doing with their life, but that is what I intend to do with the rest of mine. I know I can think and talk and am pretty good at offering conversation and opinion and that\u0027s what I\u0027m going to do.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo achieve that, as a living, I want to ask you for your support, your patronage. If you enjoy my thoughts, my ideas, please consider what they are worth to you. Many blogs use as a model the tried and true commercial sponsor route and that\u0027s fine. But not for me. I don\u0027t ever want to find myself censoring my thoughts out of concern for losing a sponsor. Or saying things I don\u0027t really mean to attract one. I want to be supported by PATRONS whose investment is not their image or their company or product, but their own mind. Who seek to be intellectually stimulated, challenged, to hear a take, argument that is sincere and not controlled and conformed for branding purposes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon, this web site, offers the opportunity for me and so many others to do just that; to find patrons. Folks who, like minded or not, enjoy what a creator, a writer, artist, musician, has to offer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my intent to find folks who feel that outlets like this, independent thought, are of value and worthy of support. Views that are not subject to corporate control, boards, editors or even producers. These are my thoughts, thoughts of my friends, family, associates, based on a pretty full lifetime of experiences. I look forward to your feedback along with your support. To learn from you as well.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan you, will you support argument for civility for $20 a month? I want no more, and will not accept, any more than that from any one individual supporter. Just as I don\u0027t want business interests influencing my thoughts, I do not to be beholden to any one, or a few or even several larger patrons.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps a voice in the wilderness of incredible amounts of information of our age. I hope you judge this voice to be reasoned, thoughtful, honest and good argument for civility. And worth supporting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ask for your patronage and I thank you in advance!\u003cbr\u003ePlease click on \u0027Become a Patron\" upper right and become a patron!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLarry Gude\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
