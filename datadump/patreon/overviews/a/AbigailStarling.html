    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/GmJRaAS.png\" style=\"width: 346px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there, and welcome! My name is Abigail Starling, though I\u0027m much more commonly known by my online alias \"LeekFish,\" on websites such as \u003ca href=\"http://leekfish.deviantart.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003edeviantART\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://leekfish.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/LeekFish\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, where I often post new art pieces (and in the case of Twitter, babble about what I\u0027m working on and answer questions.) I\u0027m a Digital Arts graduate from the University of Oregon, now developing my own characters and comics. Currently, Steve (my partner) and I are working together on a webcomic called \u003ca href=\"http://envelovecomic.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEnvelove\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, an all-ages weekly webcomic about a courier fairy working hard to bring loved ones together. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/NGg9T8F.png\" style=\"width: 308px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, how does Patreon work? Basically, it\u0027s like a subscription where you pledge a certain monthly amount to help fund a content creator whose work you enjoy. Said creator can then focus less on income and more on creating more content. It\u0027s a pretty awesome way to watch a content creator further their passion! \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy Patreon helps me focus more on my own original ideas and comics- it\u0027s thanks to my amazing friends and supporters that I\u0027ve grown so much as an artist over the last couple of years! I don\u0027t like taking without giving back, so of course there\u0027s a sizable roster of reward tiers you can check out. Rewards range from comics to custom art to coupons and credit for \n\u003ca href=\"https://leekfish.moe/store/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy shop\u003c/a\u003e. Additionally I give everyone a first look at new art before anyone else, and I hold monthly sketch request livestreams!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aQsYoLY.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m working hard and trying to bring more color and creativity to the world little by little. Thank you for checking out my art, and I hope you enjoy!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrequently Asked Questions:\u003cbr\u003eQ: When do I get charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA: Pledges for the current month are charged on the 1st of the following month.\u003c/strong\u003e So for example, January pledges are processed on February 1st. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: When do I get my rewards?\u003cbr\u003eA: I start that \"Patreon cycle\" after pledges are processed!\u003c/strong\u003e For rewards involving shipping, those parcels are typically sent out every other month, barring irregular circumstance (this helps cut down shipping costs.) Art postcards are voted on in the current month so they can be sent out post-pledge processing cycle. This allows people to sign up for that tier if they see a new postcard they like!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How do I send you my requests?\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eEvery month I post saying I\u0027m ready\u003c/strong\u003e to have requests sent in! \u003cstrong\u003eIf you do not send me your requests, I will send you a message- if I still don\u0027t hear back I will opt for artist\u0027s choice.\u003c/strong\u003e This helps me prevent getting backed up while also delivering rewards in a timely manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: When are the request streams held?\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Unfortunately I have a hectic and unpredictable schedule, but \u003cstrong\u003eI generally post a week before holding a stream.\u003c/strong\u003e Keep an eye out!! If I am unable to do one in a month, I\u0027ll usually double up on the following month. If you had pledged for that time you\u0027re still welcome to drop a request on the post! \u003cbr\u003e"
