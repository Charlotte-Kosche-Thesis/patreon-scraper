Our mission is to have beautiful and appropriate garments available for every family in need at absolutely no cost.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Angel Gown Project of California accepts gently used wedding dresses and formal gowns throughout the year.  Each gown is cataloged, dismantled and transformed by volunteer seamstresses.  After the Gown is complete, it is packaged along with a special gift for the family, and delivered to one of many California Hospitals.  Included in the packaging, the family will find a catalog number where they have the option to reach out to those responsible for donating their wedding dress and those involved in creating their Angel\u0027s special gown.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe operate on the kindness and generosity of our supporters to help supply us with packaging materials, sewing equipment and replacement and shipping costs needed to keep us running. \u00a0I have created this Patreon page to give your supporters the opportunity to donate on a monthly basis in hopes that we can keep growing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
