    "summary": "Hiya! My name is Sarah but I also go by Angel or AngelFox. I have been cosplaying since 2009 and have been learning more to improve my cosplaying. Though I have been cosplaying for a while I have just gotten more into the community and would love to learn more.\u00a0 I love cosplaying my favorite characters and bringing them to life. It has become something I am passionate about and I love also doing photography for it.\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to grow more and do more cosplays over the years. Starting to learn to make more of them and a little more about props. I can hand sew small things and can make things like horns or other small props. I also tend to be pretty decent at styling my wigs.\u003cbr\u003eThe making of this page is to help me further my life in this community. But real life obligations come first but I love this hobby so much I wouldn\u0027t want to drop it. This is a community I would love to become more active in so I feel this is a good step forward. Please feel free to check out my facebook for my work so far and events I attend.\u003cbr\u003eI hope the next few years will be even better then the past. Also that my cosplaying and photography will improve as well. I want to continue doing something I love so much for a very long time."
