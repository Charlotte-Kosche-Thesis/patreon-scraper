    "summary": "I am a\nBritish visual artist whose work fuses craft, sculpture \u0026amp; BioArt to explore our\nrelationship to the microbial world, medicine \u0026amp; technology. My work creates a non-hierarchical forum for dialogue between scientists, researchers, healthcare workers and the wider public and provides a means of communicating complex issues and innovations in biomedical science, healthcare and emerging technologies to diverse audiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/78682a291b56808f3ac0ba5a9c1817f6/tumblr_inline_omzeppFcz71qznh48_500.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImage: Microbe Mouth - Tooth grown in the lab from bacteria, in collaboration with Dr Melissa Grant and Dr Rachel Sammons, University of Birmingham\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will enable me to progress my work in directions that I feel have the greatest urgency. I want to focus on making art which explores issues around antibiotic resistance, the patient journey, access to healthcare, and the role of artificial intelligence and robotics in medicine. Sometimes the funding/commissioning systems within the art world don\u0027t facilitate artists to follow their hearts and make the works and projects they are most passionate about and the ones there is most need with their audiences. I\u0027m particularly keen to develop new works focussed on tuberculosis and global health, archaea and robotics, how plasmids transmit antibiotic resistance and the history and future of microbiology. I\u0027m keen to work with diverse audiences including older persons, young people and those with complex educational needs as well as using my work to reach out to people who don\u0027t have regular access to find out about issues in contemporary medicine and new technologies. I\u0027ve developed the concepts and collaborations needed to make these new works but I\u0027m looking for help to support the costs of time, travel and materials. Your support will also help me leverage public and private funding in the form of \u0027match funding\u0027 for grant applications.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/c3b95ad3738e2d87da529d2d79556566/tumblr_inline_n0fiwvwePY1qznh48.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImage: Pneumothorax Machine in collaboration with Modernising Medical Microbiology\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also help me to continue to regularly update the popular art/science Facebook group \"The Institute of Unnecessary Research\" which provides news about opportunities and art commissions for artists and researchers involved with curiosity driven art and science research, see more about the group here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/119297011497093/\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/groups/119297011497093/\u003c/a\u003e as well as my new Facebook page\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/annadumitriuarts/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/annadumitriuarts/\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a successful international exhibition profile and have exhibited around the world at venues including the Picasso Museum (Barcelona), Ars Electronica (Linz), BOZAR (Brussels), the\nScience Gallery Dublin, the Museum of Contemporary Art (Taipei), Waag Society (Amsterdam), Kapelica Gallery (Ljubljana), Art Laboratory Berlin, ZKM (Karlsruhe), the Museum of the History of Science (Oxford) \u0026amp; the V \u0026amp; A (London). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m2hwrmAhos1qznh48.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImage: MRSA Quilt, in collaboration with Modernising Medical Microbiology\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work embedded in scientific \u0026amp; biomedical\nsettings \u0026amp; am artist in residence on the Modernising Medical Microbiology\nProject at the University of Oxford, visiting research fellow: artist in\nresidence in the Department of Computer Science at The University of Hertfordshire,\nvisiting research fellow in the Wellcome Trust Brighton \u0026amp; Sussex Centre for\nGlobal Health at Brighton \u0026amp; Sussex Medical School, \u0026amp; research fellow at\nWaag Society Amsterdam. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI undertook a residency at the Liu Laboratory\nfor Synthetic Evolution at The University of California in Irvine (USA) \u0026amp;\nthe resulting artworks were featured in the ground-breaking exhibition\n\u201cWETWARE\u201d at the Beall Center for Art\u0026amp; Technology in Irvine (USA).
