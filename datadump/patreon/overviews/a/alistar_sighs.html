    "summary": "Hi, Guys. I\u0027m a starving Artist, but I want to tell you guys a little bit more about myself and what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Al, and I am Transgender.\u003cbr\u003eI currently live in lovely Bigoted Southern North Carolina.\u003cbr\u003eDue to some events that happened in my past I have PTSD and a Severe Anxiety Disorder towards people. Most days I can\u0027t leave my house, more or less my room. I also have brain damage from a concussion I had received a few years back. Those components together along with a few different forms of harassment totally ruined my chances of going to college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only way I\u0027ve really been able to cope with and combat against my mental illness is through creative expression. My Comic that just launched \"From Heaven We Sin\" is a metaphor for how my mental illness has affected my relationships with other people as well as how I have viewed myself in the past. The storyline and setting really give me a place where I can express myself and feel comfort when Drafting and drawing. I feel like, since I\u0027ve based the characters on actual people that they seem more relatable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out the comic at: Though, this project has been halted on smackjeeves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://fhws.smackjeeves.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://fhws.smackjeeves.com/\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/div\u003e\"From Heaven We Sin\" is also getting an RPG fro the POV of one of the characters that appear in later chapters, they are based on someone really close to my heart. You guys can stay tuned for more news on that either on my Facebook (feel free to friend me), Instagram, tumblr or my Twitter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother one of my projects is a Pokemon Comic that I hope to start soon. Ever since I was a little kid I didn\u0027t really have any friends, I didn\u0027t really go to a friends house to play. I was the friend that you only played with at school. So I\u0027d play outside by myself or I\u0027d play video games inside. Pokemon was a big influence for me because with each Pokemon that I caught, I felt that I had made an actual new friend. Hell, even for career day at school, I said that I wanted to be a Pokemon Professor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy last project I want to complete is the completely lgbtqa+ friendly comic of Lycanthrope. A supernatural comic about Werewolves and Vampires and the macabre world around them. I really wanted to focus on all different types of relationships, both healthy and unhealthy. I was really hoping to break away from the stigma of traditional straight couples so this comic is almost as gay as I am. whoops\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway\u0027s I\u0027ve been rambling for long enough.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI want people to be able to read my comic or play my games and be able to feel things that, maybe they haven\u0027t felt in a while, an that. .. Maybe they\u0027re glad to feel them again. I want to make the world a better place and heal people. One comic at a time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an artist, and I\u0027d love you guys to join me and help me on my journey, even a dollar is outstanding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you guys,\u003cbr\u003eLater!"
