I work on a series on videos and animations, mostly one review series I call \"Another Dead Reviews\", where I ain\u0027t picky on what i review. Be it some movie, video game, tv show, even a comic, i\u0027ll check it out... and chances are bash the thing, which isn\u0027t always the case. While focusing mainly on Another Dead Reviews (Or \"ADR\"), i also do another video series, one i haven\u0027t jumped on for a while, \"DeCensored\", where I look over the edits and censorship certain films had to endure to get a R Rating. (And whatever video idea comes into mind)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been doing these videos for the past five years (Admittingly, the beginning was the slow part), but since then, I kept doing them on the side with my own cash, working with what i have. But if i wanna keep doing these videos, i might need some help, which is where Patreon comes into play.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you ever seen my vids and were like \"They\u0027re good, but he should work on the video and sound some more...\" or \"Man, I wish he\u0027d review :Insert random thing here:...\", well, you\u0027re in luck as you can help make that happen by pledging and donating. (Is that the same thing? Eh, whatev.) It don\u0027t matter how much you donate, every cent counts. Course, if you need to cancel pledges at anytime, that\u0027s cool. If you also need to set a cap on how much you donate a month, who am i to complain?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you donate the smallest amount... well, at least two dollars, you\u0027ll get a special reward. And the more you donate, the better the rewards. That being said, don\u0027t just go for the highest reward, only donate what you think is best, still get something out of it either way. Course, alongside with donating to help out my videos, you might also get to help me out with some goals, like allowing me to go to conventions to meet up with you guys, do some reviews on stuff that\u0027s normally out of my price range, or maybe even allow me to work on some projects i\u0027ve been wanting to do. Like i said, every cent counts. So if you\u0027re up for it, feel free to be a patron and help a guy out!\u003cbr\u003e"
