    "summary": "Hi!\u00a0 This is where I explain why you should pledge to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who have come to this Patreon unawares, I make jewelry, primarily from vintage and antique elements.  Re-use and salvage are driving tenets in Artefact Redux, thus when I say vintage and antique I am referring to actual age, not aesthetic.  I do supplement with new components as needed though I strive to minimise this as much as possible.  While I\u0027ve been dabbling in vintage/salvaged components since I started jewelry in middle school, the decision to focus solely on vintage and antique did not happen until I met my husband in 2006.  We hatched Artefact Redux soon after we met, and here it is now.  He has since passed and I\u0027ve shouldered the creative process entirely, learning and achieving so much along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2016 marked the tenth year for Artefact Redux. \u00a0That\u0027s over ten years of festivals, galleries, shows, and various internet locations. \u00a0It might be time to copyright, get the business license, and so on. \u00a0I also want my own site again, an umbrella under which the various platforms I\u0027m on can be accessed in addition to allowing me creative control and original content. \u00a0Patrons will be facilitating this next level of realness. \u00a0In addition, patronage will allow me to purchase set-ups and supplies for soldering and PMC, two techniques I\u0027ve lusted after for many year. \u00a0Patronage will also let me either purchase a light-box set up or outsource my product photography. \u00a0And finally, it would be awesome to eat. \u00a0Food is kinda the best.\u003cbr\u003e"
