One of my goals is to try bringing people closer to the science they fund through their tax dollars via regular discussions on Periscope. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the past 2.5 years, I\u0027ve been using Periscope, Twitter\u0027s video live-streaming platform, to communicate topics in neuroscience and biology in real time via mobile devices. While impromptu live-streams have been very engaging, I\u0027ve recently been attempting to produce higher quality coverage of specific topics via broadcasts from a computer. However, my computer has recently had its 7th birthday - and, despite internal upgrades, has reached its computational limits and has become a bottleneck to quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny contributions will be allocated towards acquiring better equipment with which I can improve the quality and frequency of audio \u0026amp; video productions, and are deeply appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e"
