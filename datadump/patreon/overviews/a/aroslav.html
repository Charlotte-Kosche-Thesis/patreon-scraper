I\u0027ve published some of the books in both paperback and eBook, but not everyone wants to contribute to Amazon\u0027s Goliath. This page is a simple way for you to contribute to the effort to keep me writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day, I am thankful for my readers. It isn\u0027t money that I write for.
