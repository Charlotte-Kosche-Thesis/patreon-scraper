    "summary": "Since completing a degree in fine art photography (more years ago than I\ncare to remember), I\u2019ve had work published and exhibited as well as supplemented my income selling\nprints to private collectors. Before moving to Spain I also\nheld a number of positions teaching photography in further education.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt may sound a little pretentious to some but I consider myself \u2018an artist who uses a camera\u2019 rather\nthan a \u2018commercial photographer\u2019.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy interest in photography extends further than the false notion of the \u2018Real Spain\u2019. The real Spain encompasses the darker side of\nlife. You\u2019d be as likely to find me at the roadside photographing road kill or\nwandering a city seeking out the harsh realities of everyday life as you would\nto find me photographing old folk sat around quaint villages, flamenco dancers\nor some of the countries glorious landscapes and seascapes. That\u2019s not to say I\ndon\u2019t have a love for the prettier side\nof the country; I just like to dig deeper than a picture postcard view of the\nworld.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course I do commercial work to help pay the bills, but I only accept\ncommissions that really interest me. I\u2019m in the lucky position of not having to\naccept every offer of photography work that comes through the door; I have an understanding wife and we have\nother interests that keep food on the table and the wolves from our door. I\u2019d\nrather stick needles in my eyes than photograph a wedding or do studio\nportraiture of cute kids or scantily clad young (or not so young) ladies to\nmake them feel or look better than they actually do. Set me off on the road\ndoing travel photography or the editorial photography I\u2019m doing at the moment and\nI\u2019m much more in my element.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn these disruptive days of digital photography many people seem to assume that photography costs next to nothing to produce. That\u0027s far from the truth! Setting aside the cost of quality gear - time is money - distance is money - my style of photography is an investment of both against future rewards.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eThis is why I\u0027m here...\u003c/h3\u003e\nThere\u0027s a simple equation to explain my motives... \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003em = t+d\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u2234\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u221dp\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eWhere m=money t=time, d=travel, and p=photographs\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nJoking aside, your support will provide me with more opportunity to travel, and therefore increase my photographic output!

I\u2019ve also done commercial and \npress work over the years too \n\u003cem\u003e(though never weddings - as I mentioned earlier, I\u0027d rather stick needles in my eyes!)\u003c/em\u003e. I think I can safely, on that basis, call\n myself a \u2018photographer\u2019. The truth of it is though, it\u2019s not always \nbeen my priority although I have kept my hand in part-time. After \nfinishing my degree, I drifted in and out of photography as a career due\n to many distractions: beer, women, work, travel, kids, marriage, \ndivorces, money \u2013 you name it, there\u2019s been a million of them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSeveral years ago (perhaps you could call it a mid-life crisis) I decided \nthere was still time in my life to reconnect properly with that side of\n myself and I\u2019ve fallen in love with photography as an art form all over\n again. In doing so I\u2019ve rediscovered a part of myself. In fact, \nphotography was one of the reasons for us moving to mainland Spain from \nLanzarote in 2012. As pretty as Lanzarote and the Canary Islands are, I\u2019m not a \u2018picture postcard\n photographer\u2019. I needed a hefty dose of reality to get my teeth into.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAt the risk of coming across all \u2018TV talent show sob story\u2019 I\u2019d like \nto tell you something more personal to me. Since I set off on this path again something happened elsewhere to confirm I was doing\n the right thing \u2013 something that touched me deeply. On the 16th of November 2014 my \nMum died. Some people who know me well may not even have known this until now\n as I\u2019m not the fishing for sympathy on Facebook type, I\u2019m quite a \nprivate person. My Mum didn\u2019t know all that much about my day-to-day \nlife and living overseas I hadn\u2019t seen her for longer than should have been the case. In\n the aftermath of that I spent three weeks over in the UK with her \nhusband helping him with practicalities and just being there for him.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe talked a lot in that time, as you might imagine, and during one of \nthose conversations he told me that only a couple of weeks earlier my mother had told him she was disappointed I hadn\u2019t fulfilled the \n(photographic) ambitions I\u2019d talked to her about thirty plus years ago. It \nwasn\u2019t that she was disappointed in me; it was that she was disappointed\n FOR me. I was amazed she\u2019d even remembered those discussions, and never\n realised she knew how much it mattered to me. I wish she\u2019d known I was \nback on this track. I wish she\u2019d known that at age 50 I had decided \nthere was still time to get where I wanted to go. She\u2019d have been so \npleased.
