While Kickstarter is used for large projects, Patreon is more for a continuous run of content and creations. So while everyone on Kickstarter can back money towards something like a video game or movie, Patreon is used to support people creating consistent content such as animations, art, music, and such.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Kickstarter, you pay for the project before it\u0027s completed, while for Patreon you pay AFTER a piece is completed and put up.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDo you like silly cartoon shorts with team-colored killers or colorful cartoon horses in the 3D realm? Or just over-the-top hilarity in animation?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly I love creating what I make. It\u0027s fun to make and look back at, but especially satisfying to read what people say or see others react to what I\u0027m doing and get a good laugh. I love to entertain and animating is how I go about doing it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to do larger projects with more people, musicians, voice actors, or even writers and such but would like to pay them for helping me out. I use what I make from Patreon and put it back towards creating larger and more ridiculous shorts, or equipment needed to continue producing pieces. (It also wouldn\u0027t hurt if this could be a full-time paying job.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yes, you can continue to watch my content and if you\u0027d like to support me, that\u0027d be totally awesome! If not, well then I just hope that you continue enjoying what you see.\u003cbr\u003e"
