    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alexia Burns and I\u0027m an animation artist living in British Columbia, Canada. I\u0027ve had a love for drawing for as long as I can remember, but I only started investing myself in art as a profession in the last 5 years. Since then, I\u0027ve spent loads of my free time creating fan art for some of my favourite things, and I love sharing these drawings with people who have the same passions that I do. The enthusiasm and encouragement that I have found through fan art has pushed me to grow as an artist in the last year, and I\u0027m so grateful for everyone who finds something in my art that they love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decided that I wanted to do more with my art, to be able to provide more for the people who have supported me endlessly, and through the encouragement of some friends I\u0027ve found myself here. So, I\u0027d like to dedicate some of my time to giving anyone willing to support me a look into my creative process. I will post development sketches and sneak peeks into new pieces that I\u0027m working on, and I will create at least one Patreon exclusive painting per month, with periscopes to answer any questions and talk through the creation of the piece. And for those who are willing to pledge a little extra, I\u0027ll let one person each month decide what I\u0027m drawing, and I will also send out signed prints of said piece for your very own! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am incredibly grateful for anyone who is willing to support me in my art in any way that you can. I would love to have more time to create and connect with you, so I hope that this will help me in doing just that. So \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e, from the bottom of my heart. Let\u0027s create some art!\u003cbr\u003e"
