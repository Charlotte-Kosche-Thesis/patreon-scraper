From the beginning, I have had one goal, and that was to increase access to environmental changemakers, allowing people just like you and me to join them in their journey to make this planet a better place for all of us to live. And\u00a0from that, we are inspired to\u00a0shift our own daily habits to minimize our footprint and improve our local communities and environment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur guests have included environmental changemakers from around the world such as Maikwe Ludwig, former Executive director of Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage, Topher White, founder of Rainforest Connection and Bea Johnson, author of Zero Waste Home and world-renowned\u00a0zero-waste advocate. ASM has helped past guests launch books, land speaking engagements and promote international campaigns but what is more impressive is the impact it has had on you, the listener.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSusan and Rachael from Seattle were moved to have more conversations as a couple about the impact their family and household would have on the environment.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLuke and Mara of Los Angeles were encouraged to switch their large trash and small recycling containers and now, between recycling and composting produce a tiny fraction of the trash they produced prior to listening to the show.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eASM has even inspired multiple college students to switch their majors to environmental sciences and a middle school teacher in Maryland to introduce more environmental\u00a0sustainability content to her students. Now, she plays the show for her class!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am committed to helping environmental changemakers bring their stories to the masses, to inspire us, promote earth-consciousness and protect this planet for future generations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to help promote the important work of environmental changemakers, consider becoming a patron. The planet thanks you, and so do I.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSustainably yours,\u003cbr\u003eMarjorie\u003cbr\u003e"
