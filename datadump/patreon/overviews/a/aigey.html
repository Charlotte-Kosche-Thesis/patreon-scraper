I just wanted to let everyone looking at this know that this is not something you have to do but if you want to support I\u2019ll be forever in your gratitude for doing such! While I may not be the best at youtube and no where near as good as the idols I look up to, doing something like that this really helped in allowing me to expand as a content creator. And since you guys are going to be supporting me this way it\u2019s only fair for me to explain how I play to use the money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor starters, yes I\u2019ll be upgrading my equipment, Getting better equipment for streaming and gaming in general will be very helpful when trying to record games at higher quality to bring all of you the best that I possibly can. Saving for food. While yes, I intend to purchase the occasional pizza I\u2019ll use the money for groceries and expenses like I would a job so that I can continue to focus on getting better and better at producing content for you guys. Youtube doesn\u2019t pay much and I do this because I enjoy making the videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you can\u2019t support with money that\u2019s more than okay. still watching videos and leaving comments will help me become a better youtuber as well, and either way no matter what you choose to do, I\u2019ll be grateful for whatever you may choose. \u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for being awesome! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDONT FORGET the discord server I use is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/0hwXk8C0DjngMCkn\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/0hwXk8C0DjngMCkn\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Aigey\u003cbr\u003e"
