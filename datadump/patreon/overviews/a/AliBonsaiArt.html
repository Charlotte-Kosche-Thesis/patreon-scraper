I\u2019m obsessed with art and music, this is what I can do.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m building up a portfolio of images on here for people to use as prints, posters or whatever they want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can use these images for free but I would like to suggest a small donation of what you feel is appropriate. I\u2019m hoping to build up a working portfolio from Patreon, which will act as a hub for my artwork and give me the ability to eventually become an independent working artist. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e(As long as my images are not used to endorse any form of hatred, Xenophobia, Racial discrimination etc\u2026 You know, all that sort of stuff! Sorry, evil people! I know you need images, too!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you like my work, then remember to check in regularly to see more works, as I post them up. Any suggestions and feedback will always be appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m planning to create a tier system for things like high quality signed prints and original artworks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u2019s the long version - I graduated in 2003 in Fine Art (BA Hons) at Nottingham trent University. I started in 1997 and it took me 6 years to complete a 3 year course. If it wasn\u2019t for the support network of staff, friends and the health services, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to complete it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suffer from acute anxiety, in its many forms. It\u2019s a constantly derailing element of my life that I have learned to cope with. There\u2019s certain things, I consider to be good at, such as making art, writing songs, singing and playing guitar. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m able to perform in front of an audience, which is at odds with not being able to answer the phone or go outside, sometimes. It\u2019s all about the preparation and employing coping strategies, from a long line of trials and errors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOrganising, in general has become one of my greatest rivals. The daily battle with continuity has become, itself, the integrity behind my work. I see it as a mangled tessellation of first and third person visualisations. To make sense of the irreverence of life, telegraphed as the main protagonist. It\u2019s self therapy from the core of how it feels to be alive, or Ouroboros in the act of eating its own tail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
