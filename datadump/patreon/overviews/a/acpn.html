    "summary": "Welcome to the Patreon for ACPN. My name is John J. Galbo, and I have been podcasting since 2007. Inspired by the big podcast boom, I started a show based on Cartoon Network\u0027s Adult Swim block. Eventually, in 2011, I branched out into Pop Culture, Entertainment, and much more by starting Adventure Club Podcast.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve hosted and curated a number of podcasts including:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Swimcast (the longest running Adult Swim podcast... plus now other animated/comedy shows)\u003cbr\u003eThe Flux Capacicast: A Back to the Future Podcast\u003cbr\u003eDrunk on Disney (featuring authors Bart Scott and Guy Hutchinson well as voice actor and comedian Dana Snyder)\u003cbr\u003eBunchojunk (Guy Hutchinson\u0027s personal chats with celebrities)\u003cbr\u003eTechies (a short-lived tech show hosted by myself)\u003cbr\u003e#Deep13: The Podcast: (another short-lived podcast on Mystery Science Theater 3000)\u003cbr\u003eThe Unofficial Sesame Place Podcast: A podcast all about the Sesame Place theme park by Guy (who authored a book on Sesame Place).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis led us collectively start our very own podcast network, known as ACPN (named AFTER Adventure Club Podcast, but not necessarily what the \"call letters\" mean. We\u0027ll never tell... at least not honestly). The podcasts together are EASILY 1,000+ hours of podcast content, saved conveniently on the site, plus on iTunes, Stitcher, Tune-In, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, in the past year or two\u00a0have brought in a number of shows from comedians such as Paul Goebel (Beat the Geeks) and Jermaine Fowler (Superior Donuts) as well as countless others that we host on the site, slowly building ourselves up as an independent podcast network based on Popular Culture, Comedy, Geek, Entertainment, and more!\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://www.theacpn.com\"\u003eGo here to take a look at our current roster\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I have a lot of ideas that may/may not be brilliant, I don\u0027t always get them out there. Add to that, the fact that collectively, we\u0027re in no means \"professional.\" That is to say, I have much in the way of professional equipment... the way I podcast for the most part is over Skype with people on a 2012 MacBook Pro with a Snowball Mic (the latter being my most recent investment, since they made it affordable). Add in the fact that while very generous, the fine folks who host all of our content, still need assistance from us in paying from time to time. So... better tech/equipment, domain fees, server fees, yadda yadda...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of that, I for one would love to utilize a potential revenue to provide even more things for the network... maybe (here we go with this...) produce our own merchandise to give to our listeners, maybe purchase space at various conventions to host our podcasts, maybe be able to rent out an entire boat-converted-restaurant (we\u0027ve discussed this for Adventure Club a few times), maybe rent out studio space to host \"professional\" recorded episodes. Like I said, there\u0027s a lot of maybes, and a lot of ideas in my head to utilize any revenue we would possibly get. So in a nutshell, we\u0027re looking to beef up the network and continue to give you quality podcast listening, but we need your help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get back? You\u0027ll get to be a part of the network in one way or another. Once we\u0027ve gotten things going, we have some ideas for goals if you awesome listeners contribute... not just \"shout outs\" either, you can guest on an episode on a show of your choice, or perhaps join us on special events both live and/or online. However, as Egg Shen from Big Trouble in Little China says after the opening Fox logo... \"It always begins, very small.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
