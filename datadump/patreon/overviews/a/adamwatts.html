No small task... especially at the scale I envision doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI ended up here on Patreon because I just ponied-up some dough in support of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/jordanbpeterson\"\u003eJordan Peterson\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e and my pal and partner\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/jacksonpercussion/posts\"\u003eMike Jackson\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e Patreon pages . . . and on a whim of sorts, decided that I\u0027d make this page for what I\u0027m doing/planning.\u00a0I guess it was more than a whim because that decision instantly brought tears to my eyes... which surprised me (\"uh, where did THAT come from?!\") . . . Those tears were a signal that this is a big step in the right direction. . . the crossing of another key threshold in this journey I\u0027m on... as if a pipe was bursting and pent-up steam was hissing out . . . and here\u0027s . . .\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I can\u0027t stand idly by as I watch artists around me (friends and artists I work with professionally) struggle against an industry and culture that is \u003cem\u003e(in many ways understandably and often unintentionally to some degree)\u003c/em\u003e constantly pressuring them to push down and stifle their unique artistic identity, chase trends,\u00a0and be a kind of slave to the striving for \u003cem\u003emoney-above-all-else\u003c/em\u003e in the search for a viable career and support in their journey and purpose as artists. If you\u0027re in the brown-paper-bag-business, maybe you can afford to put profit above all else, but prioritizing in this way with the arts is active participation in a downward spiral.\u00a0This is no joke.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my view, it\u0027s become an epidemic of sorts. Why?! Because this \u003cem\u003edisease of process\u003c/em\u003e is killing off \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe Music That Could\u0027ve Been.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003eAnd I\u0027ve seen its opposite. Every once in a while. . . when I\u0027ve been a part of sessions when something real/truthful/vulnerable/honest was expressed\u2013in spite of external pressures\u2013and the results transcend. I\u0027ve noticed that without fail, that kind of work always stands the test of time. Not only that, if that work has some financial backing (i.e. the artist has a record deal), often that music ends up reacting the best out in the world as well (i.e. people love it and it sells). Why? Because the motivations that undergirded the creative process were truthful and they were not fear, fame, or money driven. I\u0027ll be honest though, this is the exception.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been watching as the backwards process of being \u003cem\u003efear-fame-money-driven\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0subtly (or obviously) crushes artist\u0027s spirits and causes them to second guess everything that is beautiful and real about who they are and what they\u0027re capable of. Or worse, artists embrace this backwards process to such a degree that they view the whole thing as a simply a game they attend to win. Their artist self is then sidelined and cowers in the corner of their psyche, forgotten and neglected as some part of their ego takes charge. It\u0027s a sad sight to see when they\u0027re clearly capable of so much more. I admit I\u0027ve done this exact same thing and it eats at me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat we all want\u2013including those in the business!\u2013is art that rises above all the noise and speaks of personal truth while it simultaneously (and as a direct result) shines a big spotlight on the universal truths about what it is to be alive and living. We all just want authenticity. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eTHIS is the spirit we intend to saturate all efforts with at BCA.\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m humbly asking for your support because I want to put significant energy into this. To continue to do \u003cem\u003ewhatever I can\u003c/em\u003e to make my own music, art and educational materials that are as authentic and worthwhile as humanly possible while also seeking to mentor/educate/guide (and learn from) artists who seek to do the same thing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you may be getting the sense that this Holistic Approach idea is a bit vague and mushy. It\u0027s not. There are highly pragmatic ways to integrate deeply emotional/spiritual/philosophical and individually focused concepts into the teaching of technique that empowers high-level music making. I\u0027ve used this approach in my own work and within my career and I\u0027ve witnessed it working in the work and careers of others. \u00a0What is complex is the process of pointing out what is hidden in plain sight and codifying into an approach (and accompanying curriculum) that connects all the dots between The Four Pillars. I\u0027ve now finished my book on this approach and I\u0027m well on the way in expanding this out into curriculum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs Jordan Peterson so eloquently expresses in much of his work: it starts with the individual speaking the truth to organize the chaos. So, this is me putting forth my truth, standing behind it and taking some action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT THEN?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe recent results are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy book: \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.wearebrokencity.com/shop/book\"\u003eThe Human of Being Art: A Holistic Approach to Being an Artist and Creating Art\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA vision: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBroken City Artists\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003ca href=\"http://www.wearebrokencity.com\"\u003eWeAreBrokenCity.com\u003c/a\u003e).

This is a game changer and totally reverses what has become the music-education norm, which is to send artists through a gauntlet of learning technique as if art is a sport. It\u0027s not!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY PERSONAL JOURNEY:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this started coming into focus after my pal Jack Hafer (Biola University Film Professor) encouraged me to \u003cem\u003eactually write down\u003c/em\u003e the ideas and passionate-ramblings I\u0027d been sharing with him over our many lunch meetings (thanks, Jack!)... Ideas about what it is to be an artist. Ideas about the insanity and beauty of the creative process.... about the often intense inner struggles artists deal with when trying to get their insides out while dealing with mountains of insecurity. While dealing with the intense desire, we have to be vulnerable and to be heard, seen, recognized and appreciated... Ideas about how to bring the entire self to what we create... about how to navigate this mess and not lose ourselves in the process.... and last but not least, ideas about how to forge a career in the face of Modern Western Culture and Big Business.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo, I started writing... and didn\u0027t stop for over two years. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way, some incredibly generous and equally passionate people (Mike! Amber! Lisa! Natalie!) welcomed and shared feedback on chapters as they came rushing out like more steam through a yet another crack in the pressurized pipeline of my consciousness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was springing leaks all over the place, and it felt good.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I\u0027ve experienced in my 20-year career in the music industry (and other arts industries) and my 28 years as a musician/songwriter/producer/engineer/visual-artist etc. fueled these writings. I\u0027ve both failed miserably and succeeded beyond what I ever imagined, all while beating myself to a pulp and being beaten up by various parts of this journey. Being a life-long career-artist requires a paradoxical combination of thick and thin skin. We have to be self-aware and vulnerable to create and yet be able to handle being right in the line of fire while we do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe road to this point has made me who I am and has galvanized my resolve to make some sense of it and do my little part to change the world for the better.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOKAY, BUT... WHERE EXACTLY IS MY MONEY GOING IF I SUPPORT YOU?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you on the fence . . . those with a slightly suspicious nature (I get it). Let me be even more transparent (and vulnerable!):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I began acting from a more authentic place with my creativity, time and career, some things began to shift and change. In 2014, a decade-long songwriting-contract with Disney ended. Three years before, in 2011, I had begun spending less time being a kind of \u003cem\u003esemi-\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003emindless-ambition-machine (\u003c/em\u003echasing after some goals I didn\u0027t believe in) and I\u0027d begin spending more time in my sweet-spot. In a deep corner of my creative life that I often had to relegate to my solo work and a few other special projects along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this change (and the mental/emotional organization that led to my book) has led me to new and exciting personal \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e career relationships. Ones that are far more aligned with my new goals (i.e. with my truer self). That said, because of my goals on the education/artist-mentorship side, it also has led to less financial security (it\u0027s worth it though). So this new stage\u2013and this step to launching this Patreon page\u2013is all about \u003cem\u003eputting MEANING first\u003c/em\u003e. Life is just too short to do anything else. This means risking being vulnerable and open about what I feel (and know) is right and true... the things that matter . . . and doing something about it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, your support will go toward freeing me up to be a Mindful-Meaning-Machine! So I can wake up every day and go after the artistic and educational efforts that I believe deeply will make a difference and serve the lives of other artists and fans of\u00a0authentic and meaningful art AND navigate careers doing it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou, as a supporter, will be directly enabling me to spend more time on this pursuit. And I\u0027ll be deliberate in thinking of ways to express my appreciation to you along the way.\u003cbr\u003e__________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t lie, a part of me feels like expressing this stuff and fully acting on it could be damaging to my livelihood... but \u003cem\u003eI can\u0027t not do it\u003c/em\u003e.... and the truth is, any reluctance is just fear talking, so I\u0027m telling Fear to shut-the-hell-up... and I\u0027m hoping you will come with me on this journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

His self-produced debut solo album \u201cThe Noise Inside\u201d, was voted one of the Top Ten Albums of that year by Christianity Today and was also named The Best New Artist of 2004 by the same publication. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWatts has released seven solo albums to date including his most recent album, \"The Hero and the Pain\u201d, released in March of 2016.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eVisual Art:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWatts is also an accomplished visual artist and craftsman with a focus on photography, design (graphic and mechanical), carpentry, leatherwork and mixed media fine art. Watts\u0027 highly conceptual mixed media assemblage fine artwork incorporates found objects from the Victorian era through the early 20th century. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmong many other exhibitions, Watts had multiple works chosen to be included in the Brea Art Gallery\u0027s 29th Annual Juried Exhibit \"MADE IN CALIFORNIA\" as well as in the OCCCA\u0027s show entitled \"THE BODY EXHIBIT\" with works chosen by world renowned assemblage artist George Herms.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBackground:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWatts was born and raised in a strong Christian family in Orange County, CA. He began his artistic journey as a drummer, having studied extensively with marching arts luminary Mike Jackson as well as with drumming legends, Roy Burns, Dave Weckl, Joey Heredia and Chad Wackerman. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn his late teens, Watts found his true calling when he began writing songs, singing, playing guitar, piano, bass, programming and self-producing his own music. Watts\u2019 introspective and musically adventurous music often wrestles with themes of faith, meaning, and the tension between dark and light.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eArtist Development:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWatts\u2019 lifelong Christian faith coupled with his rich and varied track record of cross-medium artistic experience has led him the the creation of a groundbreaking perspective and approach to artist development and education outlined in his book, \u003cem\u003eThe Human of Being Art: A Holistic Approach to Being an Artist and Creating Art\u003c/em\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith an integrative view on artistry, A Holistic Approach ties together psychological, spiritual, philosophical and physiological to form a cohesive approach to being an artist. Watts cuts to the heart of the wide variety of issues involved in staring true to oneself artistically. While addressing the artist\u2019s innate desire to connect with others through their work, A Holistic Approach offers a detailed road map for leading a rich and fulfilling artistic life, while offering a lucid perspective on how to flourish at the intersection of art and commerce. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eIn His Own Words:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs Watts says, \u003cem\u003e\u201cI\u2019m passionate about how God\u2019s gift of artistic self-expression can enrich our lives and connect us with ourselves and others. I believe the key to fulfilling artistic potential, is to integrate the entire self and approach our artistry holistically. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cIn modern culture, the greater purposes and potential of the arts are often hijacked by greed, ego or the desperate seeking of external validation. With so many distractions, pressures and random information coming at us everyday, it\u2019s harder than ever to filter it all and focus in on what really matters. That said, I believe there\u2019s never been a more incredible time to be an artist nor a greater need for artistic guidance and particularly, sensitive mentorship. This is why I\u2019m so excited to be a part of the growing and expanding arts program at Biola.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201c\u003cem\u003eI love helping to guide artists toward discovering and developing their unique gifting, experiences and perspectives and turning it into worthwhile art. Every human being is different, and this individuality is the foundation that all technique should be built on and is ground zero for carving a path to a viable career in the arts. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cIt\u2019s all about striving toward that special combination of excellence and authenticity. It really is possible to bring everything we are into alignment and have a rich and fulfilling artistic life, make a living and stay true to ourselves and our faith in Christ.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eLinks:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAdamWatts.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBrokenCityArtists.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.allmusic.com/artist/adam-watts-mn0000600210/credits\"\u003ehttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/adam-watts-mn000060...\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",
