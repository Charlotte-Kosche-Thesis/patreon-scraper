What is Monastic Arts?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Aaron Thomas-Bey. I am the sole-proprietor and owner, arts educator and commercial artist, at Monastic Arts, LLC. Monastic Arts is a creative arts micro start-up business based out of Columbus, Ohio, that I formed several years ago as a platform for me to operate and explore my creative art endeavors, and is my life\u0027s work and passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have\u00a0been working in the Central Ohio region for the last two decades as an educator providing arts education programming opportunities for thousands of youth participants throughout various workshops and programs over the years, having collaborated with dozens of reputable organizations, individuals, festivals and businesses during my tenure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to my arts education experience, I provide community outreach services as a commercial vendor at many public performances, venues, festivals, private parties, and supply my products with a number of retailers, while also maintaining an online presence for my loyal customers, supporters, colleagues, students, and die-hard fans. As a visual artist, I use contemporary fine arts to primarily focus on customized airbrush designs on apparel, murals, body-painting, face-painting, caricatures, portraits, and banners; likewise, offer limited signed-copy prints of some of my most iconic images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile, I have received a few grants, contracts, commissions, fellowships and loans for my work and/or business during my time as an artist, many of you - the public, have been my most trusty supporters over the years. Lets call you my patrons. I would like to personally thank you, as I wouldn\u0027t be able to be as involved as I have been without you on this journey!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn this next step of my quest to become a better artisan of my craft, I am enlisting your generous donations; thus, I am currently working on several new projects, and have a few things in the works, but most especially our long awaited facilitator\u0027s guide for arts education. Namely, I am working through the editing process now and hope to publish it before 2017 is up. Often times, many folks ask how they can help me on my mission, so in addition to having me customize your visual arts needs, you may now personally participate by making a meaningful contribution to my cause and agenda. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA patron is typically thought of as a\u00a0person who supports an artist with money, gifts, efforts, or endorsements, as all of the great masters down throughout the ages have relied on their guardianship to become and maintain their success.\u00a0For the first time in history, artists are able to cut out the middlemen gatekeepers and go straight to the source - you, the audience.\u00a0Your small contributions will allow me to meet my goals and objectives at a much faster rate, as supplies, equipment, overhead and administrative costs are quite a hindrance or nuisance for an artist to effectively flush out their vision at times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre you able to contribute?\u003c/strong\u003e If so, I am humbled and grateful beyond belief; thank you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAaron Luther Thomas-Bey\u003cbr\u003e(Al-Jabal Herun Bey)\u003cbr\u003eBeyond Imagination\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://monasticarts.wordpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMonastic Arts\u0027 Website\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
