You\u0027re here, unless you stumbled across this in some crazy deep net way, because of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://issueswithanna.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e You\u0027ve Got Issues\u003c/a\u003e, my podcast that focuses on the little and big issues that plague human beings. This is a podcast specifically designed for, well, people who are alive and in this world since if you\u0027re alive and in this world, you\u0027ve got issues.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy philosophy about that is why keep quiet when you can instead tell the world? And so every week I get a different guest to open up about his or her pettiest issue and I help that person suss out what\u0027s going on underneath (sometimes with the help of other experts). In short, you know that it bugs you to no end when a near stranger comes up and tucks in a tag you may have poking out of your shirt but you might never stop to ask WHY. (Totally obvious full disclosure: this is one of my issues and I actually ask myself WHY all the time because that\u0027s just how I\u0027m wired. The WHY in this case is it triggers some early childhood memory of feeling like I wasn\u0027t as together as the other kids because both my parents worked and so I once went to school wearing the same dress as my friend Katy but no one knew we were wearing the same dress except for me BECAUSE I WAS WEARING MY DRESS INSIDE OUT AND BACKWARDS and I felt unspeakably humiliated even though it was my own secret.) Now don\u0027t you dare think,\u00a0\"My God, that sounds serious\" because I have no interest in even having a conversation if it\u0027s not funny so there\u0027s plenty of humor sprinkled throughout. (You\u0027re allowed to think, \"Jesus that was a long sentence in that parenthetical,\" though.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, talking, recording, securing guests, conducting interviews and having them sound edited is not a hassle- or money-free experience and while I\u0027m grateful for and to any and all listeners, I have a way of feeling all the more grateful if I\u0027m breaking even. Luckily, a little bit, as people who like cliches will say, goes a long way\u2014and that\u0027s where you come in. For the cost of two stamps, you can help support this podcast and the many people out there with issues (aka 7.4 billion-ish people) (aka all of us). If you need to save that cash for your stamps, I love you anyway. But don\u0027t you know none of us mail anything anymore anyway?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Podcasts are a labor of love, which is to say that hosts have to fund these projects themselves if they don\u0027t want to charge listeners (and I very much don\u0027t). Your supporting this show means that you will be aiding the world with their issues (and thus making it a better place). Yes, helping this podcast helps the world!",

If we can meet this new goal, we can make that happen. And from there, who knows? Live podcasts from the homes of the biggest supporters? The world is our proverbial oyster, people.",
