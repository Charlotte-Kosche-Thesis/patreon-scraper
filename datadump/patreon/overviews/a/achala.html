But if you feel inside yourself some \nother melodies, melodies which are not of this world, notes that the \nSupreme Composer put in you, a song that is hidden deep within your \nheart, please sing it. Do it for yourself. Sure many will laugh at your \nvoice and will not want to dance to that rhythm, but you\u0027ll be the one \nwho will laugh last, wounded, tired, suffered, but still\u2026 Give life to \nyour song.\"\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e- Paramahamsa Vishwananda\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eEach of us has a secret song hidden inside. A mysterious rhythm, which makes us dance and has the potency to inspire others around us. My humble song is in praise of Universe and its Creator. It is in praise of stars and planets, which are creating countless songs and countless you-niverses every second, with each of their movements. It is the song for the Divine Genius hidden behind the scenes of life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI felt inspired to appear here, in this virtual space of Patreon, so I can do more what I love and share even more. My wish is to meet with more people more often and tell you more stories about the beauty of the You-niverse and Vedic Astrology. We will talk about the stars, the planets, the nakshatras, the tithis, as well as different gods presiding over different measures of time. We will learn how to connect with them more and how to discover more about ourselves and the world around us; how to slowly uplift our consciousness, so we can start perceiving the eternal Divine spark manifesting itself through each moment of time, each person we meet, and each situation we encounter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn ancient times, such teachings were given to others freely, based only on dakshina or symbolic donation, given from the heart. Appearing in this virtual space of Patreon is my humble attempt to restore this sacred tradition to the world of Vedic Astrology. You are most welcome to contribute whatever your heart tells you and to stay with us on this journey as long as you wish.
