For those who do not know me, I get the privilege to share the stage with my biggest role model, my father. I am the leading front woman to our group, \u003cstrong\u003eWorhol\u003c/strong\u003e. Outside of the band I find myself constantly \u003cem\u003ewriting\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003epainting\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003etruly just enjoying life\u003c/em\u003e. I am a published author, a model and I own my own business, \"\u003cstrong\u003eTestament Designs\u003c/strong\u003e\" where my concept is to be able to \u0027\u003cem\u003ewear art\u003c/em\u003e\u0027. One reason why I love being involved in music so much is because of the personal connections one can make. Being a signed artist, I have toured both Europe and the United States and have met such incredible people. I was once asked in an interview if I ever feared being so open with our fans and my answer will always be absolutely not. We are all on this journey we call \"\u003cem\u003elife\u003c/em\u003e\" and if I can help bring love and happiness into someone\u0027s life through friendship, music or by any form of art then I am fulfilling my life\u0027s purpose!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough strong faith I continue to be guided and through my love of life I cherish spreading positivity. I have always strived to be a role model. I want people to see that dreams do come true but that they don\u0027t come easy. Never giving up is the mental state you must choose everyday. To inspire someone most of the time results in them actually inspiring you. I choose to tell my story through my art and can only hope that it will bring beauty back into this world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always been a believer in working hard and I am at a point in my life where I am no longer afraid to ask for help. I\u0027ve always hated the whole idea of \"asking people for money/fundraising\" so I thought to myself how can I make ends meet financially to chase my dreams without it seeming like I am just asking for money. This is how, I truly want every Patron to be a part of my journey. In return, this becomes \u003cem\u003eOUR\u003c/em\u003e journey. Those who pledge will help me make decisions on current/future personal projects such as colors for a painting, help me choose an outfit for a photoshoot, give ideas for videos, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to share my life experiences and dreams with you.

I will forever be grateful and look forward to getting to know you because it\u0027s about to get personal at this pledge level! *I\u0027M HUGGING YOU SO TIGHT YOU HAVE TO GASP FOR AIR*. At this tier, once a month you and I will have a Skype call. During this call you can ask me anything you like, listen to me play, or even just ask for advice. I will go over my current ideas with you on projects and get your personal one on one feedback. You will get to know me on a deeper level and will get to hear the thoughts and ideas that go on in my crazy mind! You will also receive all previous rewards!\u00a0",
