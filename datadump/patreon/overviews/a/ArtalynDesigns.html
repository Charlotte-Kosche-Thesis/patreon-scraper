I spend any free moment I have in my studio creating cute, creepy, and creepy cute jewelry and artwork. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.artalyndesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/halloweencat-progress-vector-color-START-10-6-NBG-SM2.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI love it all. I paint, sculpt, design jewelry, and create illustrations and digital paintings. I have too many ideas in my head, and I want to give them all life!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRecently I\u0027ve become known for my jewelry design. I make plugs and fake plugs (earrings). I\u0027ve released 10 standard designs available in 8 different sizes. I\u0027ve also created some limited edition plugs that have limited reproductions. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage supports the following work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJewelry Designs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI make \nplugs for rad people with stretched ears and fake plugs for just as rad \npeople with normal pierced ears. For jewelry designs, I primarily work with polymer clay, however, I\u0027m \nstarting to branch out and experiment with new materials. Your patronage helps support improvements on my current designs as well as the creation of completely new designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.artalyndesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/jewelry3image-S.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIllustrations\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIllustrations are a fairly new venture of mine. When I was in the process of moving, I had all of my art supplies packed away except my computer and my tablet. In order to feed my creativity, I started working on sketches during my lunch breaks at work and later turned them into illustrations. I have several sketches on my studio desk that still need to be brought to life. \nYou will see them FIRST, here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.artalyndesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/flub.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.artalyndesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/HBMTL-S1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSculptures\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI enjoy making cute, and creepy cute cat inspired monster sculptures and minifigures.

Part of being an artist is always growing and evolving. In order to achieve that, I need the time and materials to dedicate to growth. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Patreon Advantage\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\nI want you to get to know the person you\u0027re supporting, ME. I will be posting more photos of my work in progress, the happenings and even mishaps going on in my studio and maybe even some videos with tips and tricks I learn throughout my journey as an artist. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe more support I receive, the more I will be able to create and release goodies for you to enjoy. I will also have secret Patreon only giveaways and secret sales for new designs so that my patrons have access to new artwork FIRST!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.artalyndesigns.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/nobgSM.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your support!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny little bit really does help and I could not do what I do without YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
