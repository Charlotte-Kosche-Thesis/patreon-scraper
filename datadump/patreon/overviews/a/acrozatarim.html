I\u0027ve worked on tabletop games including the Chronicles of Darkness, the Trinity Continuum, Babylon 5, the Starship Troopers miniatures wargame, the Judge Dredd miniatures skirmish game, and much more besides.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince it\u0027s not possible to keep all the words and ideas inside, I instead turned to the nefarious vocation of the writer and began working hard to inflict them on the rest of the world. I\u0027ve written for a variety of tabletop rpgs, worked on plots for LARP, and disgorged a number of fiction pieces too. I have to warn you that there are no signs this torrent is going to stop any time soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many other writers, I subsist largely on tea and the sense of validation that comes from knowing people are enjoying my work. Unfortunately, shops won\u0027t accept validation at the till, which can result in dangerously low tea levels. As such, I figure Patreon represents a reasonable opportunity to take people up on that oft-offered utterance of \u0027If I ever meet you, I\u0027ll buy you a beer/tea/other beverage of your choice\u0027, and get straight to the vitally important tea-buying part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt turned out that what I thought to be improbable circumstances - that of enough people pledging enough tea-purchasing currency - were, in fact, quite probable indeed. As such, I\u0027ll be producing regular material here for the Patreon community as well as my usual writings elsewhere. The first goals we\u0027ve hit due to the fantastic dedication of patrons thus far are a dark fantasy-historical web serial and a rather unusual rpg setting and, if this success continues apace, there are some new projects on the horizon as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, thank you to one and all of the gamers, writers and inspirations of the communities I partake in for all the mad, fantastical and horrific creatures, worlds and events that they\u0027ve been a part of creating with me."
