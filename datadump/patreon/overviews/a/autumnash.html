    "summary": "I\u0027m Autumn Ash, a trans author who writes erotic/romance fiction, almost always involving some element of mind control or hypnosis. \u00a0I like to explore large-scale changes (like gender transformation, which is the theme of my first major story, sexual orientation change, bimbofication, or some similarly big personality alteration) as they happen over a long period of time, usually but not always from the victim\u0027s point of view. Any kind of mind control is fair game, whether that be drugs, brainwashing, classic hypnosis, magic, or what have you. Also, in general my characters end up happy at the end. Happy in some situation they\u0027d never have thought they would be in and/or happy only because they\u0027re being controlled to enjoy what they\u0027re doing, but happy nonetheless ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I\u0027m writing \u003cem\u003eThistle, \u003c/em\u003ean erotic romance that follows Lily, a trans knight turned royal bodyguard, and Roseanna, the princess she is sworn to protect.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI release chapters publicly at autumnash.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eContributions are totally private (Assuming you\u0027ve turned off visible pledges in your account settings), and I really appreciate whatever you feel like sending my way. Any money goes to helping me pay rent, student debt, and/or my own transition.\u00a0 So if you\u0027re interested in more stories, or would just like to tip me for a fun read, consider contributing. If you enjoyed my stories and want to let me know but can\u0027t afford the expenditure, feel free to send me a note at autumnashauthor@gmail.com or on my tumblr. Thanks for reading my work!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCOMMISSIONS\u003cbr\u003eI also do commissions, at a rate of 50$ per chapter. I will work with you to write a 2000+ word story\u00a0 to your satisfaction. That means you get creative control on plot, method of control, characters, and with some limits outlined below, what fetishes are included. The + is because I guarantee at least 2000 words, but I\u0027ll write however much more than that I need to get a satisfying story in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do not write about characters under the age of 18, gore, bestiality, ageplay,\u00a0scat, or watersports. I also don\u0027t use full names in my work or write fan fiction, just to completely steer clear of those legal issues. I also reserve the right to deny any commission if I don\u0027t feel myself capable of writing it to standard.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause of my irl workload (university yay!), and to give myself an opportunity to get the creative juices flowing, I generally will complete a commission in somewhere under a month. If you\u0027re commissioning a longer work than 2k words, or you\u0027d prefer to have your commission done faster, just mention that and I\u0027m happy to work with you on scheduling!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in commissioning me, please shoot me an email at autumnashauthor@gmail.com to discuss rates and what you\u0027re looking for."
