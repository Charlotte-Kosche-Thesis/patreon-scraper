When I am done compiling enough stories about my life, I will sit with my friends and create a scripted web series, or write a book, or create more theatrical performance works. The video below is just an example of some of the things I will create with your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank my early supporters and those that will follow in the weeks to come.

If I can get enough regular patrons I will have more time to record new videos on my Whore Logic YouTube channel and to sit down and write the web series that details the life of a Black heaux. I am here to give you all the tragedy, romance, ups and downs of being a Black entrepreneur living in capitalistic New York, USA. It\u0027s unfiltered and sometimes fun. So just pay me.
