    "summary": "Good to see you here. How are you?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe? I\u0027m good, but could be better. You see, Ale of a Time is a beer website and podcast that has always been a passion project for us. Sometimes we\u0027re very active, sometimes less active, but whenever we put content up you know it\u0027ll be unique in our own little way. Whether it\u0027s outright opinion, love, anger, fear or sarcasm, it\u0027s always something we believe in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s what makes the site and podcast different to others. We aren\u0027t afraid to give our open praise or damning criticism. Not having sponsors or any real reason to please the beer industry gives us the ability to do and say whatever we like. As the founder of the site, I always want that to be the way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo years ago, I quit my cushy corporate job to focus on writing and beer full time. If I\u0027m brutally honest, it\u0027s been challenging. Financially, I\u0027m pretty much scraping by month-to-month. As a result, the energy I put in to pitching and writing for other, paid, publications and websites means I am not able to put so much energy into Ale of a Time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I really want is for Ale of a Time to become what I know it can become. I would like to have ability to publish regular content, better podcasts, more diverse opinion, and bring in more contributors. That\u0027s where you and Patreon come in. With support of those who want an alternative and independent voice in the beer world, we can keep Ale of a Time moving forward. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor seven years it has run at a loss. The time and effort I have put into the site has helped build my writing portfolio but it still costs money to do. I get occasional free beer and food, but that doesn\u0027t pay for new podcast equipment, new camera lenses, my electricity bills or even things as simple as a haircut (unfortunately there are times when even that is beyond my budget). It\u0027s the reality of freelancing and yep, it was my decision. But if you\u0027ve read or enjoyed the work we have put out over the years then a few bucks a month would mean the world. It may even result in Dave getting a little bit of money for all the awesome work he does on the podcast too. Imagine that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what do we have in store for Patrons? Well of course it\u0027s cool stuff. Stuff that we want to do. Think bottleshares, tastings events, and live podcasts. And you know it won\u0027t be just the standard \"pale ale and trestle table\" fare - it\u0027ll be the weirdest and most interesting things we can think of. Go on, look at the rewards to your right for a glimpse into the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve read this far and don\u0027t plan to give any money, that\u0027s cool. I understand. But next time you see me and I\u0027m looking scruffy, you know why.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
