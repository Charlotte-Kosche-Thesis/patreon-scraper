    "summary": "Hi I\u0027m Alex McColgan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAstrum makes space\neasier to access for the general public, taking things that are complicated and\nbreaking it down to a way anyone can understand, fuelling their interest in the\nsubject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have a passion for video making. I have since I was a\nchild. Often these would be funny short films. When I was a bit older, I got a\njob as a video editor for a training company. Making hundreds of videos for\nthem, this gave me a good feel how to explain something clearly and concisely\nin a video.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI had a phase a few years back where I would go online and\nfind everything I could about planets and objects in our Solar System. After a\nwhile of doing this, I realised a lot of people wouldn\u2019t know what I was\nlearning unless they dug deep too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI soon realised that I could combine this passion for video\nmaking with my love of space. I already had a good grounding in making informative\nvideos while working as an editor, and the space agencies out there encourage\neducators to use their huge resources.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAn issue YouTube has is a lot of space videos sensationalise\nthe topic, often claiming to have found alien structures on planets, how the\ngovernment is covering space findings up, etc. To me, this completely\nspeculative stuff detracts from all the incredible information that is out\nthere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLots of people find space interesting, but have no idea what\nthey are really seeing when they look at a picture a space agency releases.\nTake for example a picture of Saturn. Often what people see is a planet with\nrings. What they won\u2019t know is there are also tiny little moons in the picture,\neach with their own names. The rings are incredibly thin. You can\u2019t land a\nspacecraft on Saturn.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy goal with this channel is to make videos that are easy to\nunderstand to make space more accessible to most people. I want - where\npossible - to only use real images of the things I\u2019m explaining. I also want\nthe channel to be personable, where people want to come back and learn more\nbecause they trust in my videos. I want to be able to grow big enough to\nsupport myself with this channel, so I can dedicate my resources full time to\nit. I want Astrum to become a respected name in the subject of space.\u003cbr\u003e"
