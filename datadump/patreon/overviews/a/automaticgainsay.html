    "summary": "Hi! \u00a0I\u0027m Marc Doty. \u00a0Since 2006, I\u0027ve been creating demonstrative videos of vintage and modern analog synthesizers on YouTube. \u00a0As time has passed, I\u0027ve put more and more time and effort into these videos. \u00a0These days, the series of videos I make for a synthesizer require weeks of effort shooting, editing, animating, performing, recording, and composing. \u00a0It\u0027s really a tremendous effort. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNow if you were smarter than I am, and you are, you\u0027d say, \"Well, it\u0027s a good thing those companies pay you for those videos.\" \u00a0But y\u0027see, I\u0027m kind of an idiot... and I do all of that work for free... simply because I love synthesizers. \u00a0The companies I make videos don\u0027t pay me money for it (although, occasionally, they\u0027ve given me the synth I did the demonstration of. \u00a0And that is AWESOME... but it doesn\u0027t pay the bills!) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOf course, a lot of my viewers have said \"Well, gosh... if the people who watched your videos paid even a few cents, you\u0027d make a lot of money!\" \u00a0And, that is inarguably true. \u00a0My YouTube channel is now pushing 6 million views. \u00a0If I had even fifty cents for each view... I wouldn\u0027t be trying to shoot professional-seeming videos in a 10 by 15 apartment bedroom right now.\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I\u0027m not trying to get rich. \u00a0I would just like to be able to support the effort I put into these videos, and I would especially love to buy the appropriate equipment to be able to make BETTER videos for you. \u00a0Any little bit would help me put more effort and time into making the videos that so many of you seem to enjoy! \u00a0So, that\u0027s why I\u0027m here. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, I need a new car. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m just kidding. \u00a0I won\u0027t spend any of this on a car."
