Thanks for reading!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also co-host the podcast\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://daystareld.com/podcasts/rationally-writing/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eRationally Writing\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e with Daystar Eld, which is a podcast about writing and fiction with a particular focus on the element of thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what\u0027s this story you\u0027re writing about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorth the Candle \u003c/em\u003eis about Juniper Smith, a teenage boy from Kansas who gets sucked into another world that closely resembles the ones that he made as a Dungeon Master for his friends. Part of the entertainment of reading it is in the exploration, so I won\u0027t say too much more, but in contrast to what\u0027s typical to the genre, there\u0027s not all that much in the way of power fantasy, and there\u0027s quite a lot of backstory for Juniper, which happens within the text largely as flashbacks to D\u0026amp;D gaming sessions (which I\u0027ve been told are one of the highlights). Mixed in with the personal stuff are princesses, elves, and zombies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the schedule going to be like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWorth the Candle\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0has no set schedule, which has been working so well for me that I really don\u0027t want to mess with it. Chapters are of variable length, so far between 3,000 and 11,000 words, and I usually wait until I have enough material that I\u0027m not ending on a horrible cliffhanger, but that\u0027s not always how the mood strikes me, or what I think is best for the story and/or reading experience. Sometimes (usually?) chapters will be posted two or three at a time. In terms of words per day, the best month was something like 3,000 words per day, while the worst was 1,000 words per day, with the current average over the span of the story being roughly 1,800 per day. (I don\u0027t really set goals for myself, which I think has been creatively healthy, and that\u0027s what I\u0027m most concerned with.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhen does it end?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI don\u0027t know. Back at 100K words, I though it would end at 600K or 800K. Now, at nearly 400K (as of this writing), ending this within the next 200K words seems like it would leave far too much dangling for me to be satisfied, so it will be more toward 800K, meaning that it\u0027s about halfway done ... unless it goes long, which it might. Depending on how fast I write, that might mean anywhere between six months and a year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat sorts of perks are there?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatrons at the $1 (minimum) level get access to DRM-free hard copies of most of what I\u0027ve written in epub, mobi, and PDF formats. Currently, this means that you\u0027ll get the completed serial \u003cem\u003eShadows of the Limelight\u003c/em\u003e, the novella \u003cem\u003eThe Case of the Sleeping Beauties\u003c/em\u003e, and all chapters of \u003cem\u003eGlimwarden\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0that are available. \u003cem\u003eWorth the Candle \u003c/em\u003eis hosted on Archive of Our Own, which means that you just need to click the \"Download\" button in the upper-right corner to get it in a format of your choice, though be warned that the character sheet portions don\u0027t come out quite right (these are a minority of the story, I\u0027m still planning to fix that, but it\u0027s a pain and will probably wait until I have writer\u0027s block).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt $5, you get access to chapters of \u003cem\u003eWorth the Candle \u003c/em\u003ea day early. I\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/PMeRkNF\"\u003ehave a Discord\u003c/a\u003e, which I\u0027m on at night, and will be stopping in to visit whenever I\u0027m writing, or when I have a break during the day. Maybe I\u0027ll be the only person that ever visits the Discord, but hopefully not. The Discord is open to all, but the Early Bird channel will be restricted to people at (or above) that tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoals are mostly for things that I\u0027ve already put work into and just need to finish, or which already exist as notes and/or write-ups that are for internal use. I already write at about my maximum speed, which means that goals are somewhat limited to things I can do without having to take labor away from the main story, which is presumably the reason anyone is here in the first place. If existing goals are met, I\u0027ll probably include other \"behind the scenes\" or cutting-room floor type stuff, which might include some omakes of scenes that were written and tossed out (so long as they still meet my quality standards).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a pseudonym?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve been using the Alexander Wales pseudonym since I was in ninth grade, enough that the pseudonym is as much \"me\" as my real name. When you comment a lot online, and write a fair amount, and moderate a few places, that pseudonym starts to carry both weight and baggage. People read the things that you\u0027ve written in the context of the \u003cem\u003eother\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0things that you\u0027ve written, and bring in their preconceptions of whatever this new thing is going to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cthulhuraejepsen pseudonym was created so that I could participate in the every-other-week\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/rational/wiki/weeklychallenge\"\u003e/r/rational challenges\u003c/a\u003e and not have an unfair advantage because I run them (with rewards to myself going back into the pot, rather than given to an alt). After I\u0027d gone through the work of setting up all the accounts for it, it became a pseudonym where I could put stuff that I thought of as being B-roll writing. I\u0027d originally intended \u003cem\u003eWorth the Candle\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0as a thing that was going to be just for me, a weird and personal story that played exactly to my tastes and interests, but I think I overestimated how much the premise would turn people away, and instead of a dozen readers, it probably has a few thousand. (Thanks!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEventually, I found myself saying \"no, don\u0027t give me money\" one too many times, and given that money can be exchanged for goods and services, that started to seem kind of stupid. Back when I started this, I thought that I would shoot for getting it professionally published, but after the first two \"books\" it became clear that the structure wasn\u0027t really amenable to that, and it had grown way beyond the original designs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u0027t like Patreon or just want to donate a lump sum?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alexanderwales.com/about-the-author/\"\u003eThe About section on my website has a tip jar at the bottom of the page.\u003c/a\u003e And thanks!\u003cbr\u003e"

If you pledge at this tier, I will devote two hours of every day to their retrieval, sending my familiars and servants far and wide. If, after seven years time, I have not found the full collection, I will instead devote my time to reforging the keys, with the necessary sacrifices that is said to entail, may the gods have mercy on my soul. (Two hours every day excludes weekends and federal holidays.)",
