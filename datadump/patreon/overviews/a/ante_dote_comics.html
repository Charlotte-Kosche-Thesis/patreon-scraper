    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\"D.I.Y. TRYING\" was an idea for a strip that came out of sketching around the variously ridiculous, infuriating, hilarious or just plain bizarre experiences of being in a (perennially) underground punk rock band based in the UK but regularly touring across Europe. \u00a0I made it originally for myself, infrequently, and certainly with no intention to publish them, but it became (somewhat) popular among fans so I collected the strips together and released a limited edition book. \u00a0For years I\u0027ve been planning to do it \"properly\", but never got round to it... but this patreon thing made me realize that maybe I could take advantage of all these lovely tools and interconnectivity of the modern age to share, create and crowdsource, even while the book* (which I will finish one day!!) is still in the \"work in progress\" pile...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eSo! \u00a0Thanks for any patrons, friend and fans who support me in trying to support the dream - artistic freedom while staying alive in these uncertain, insecure, darn-right scary times. \u00a0You are the fuel. \u00a0This may be only one corner, but with your support I\u0027ll be able to :\u003cbr\u003ei) buy materials, resources, equipment and pay bills that enable me be able to make non-commercial art (and, perhaps more importantly, comics!)\u003cbr\u003eii) justify spending more (and hopefully, yet more) time making even more art and comics\u003cbr\u003eiii) plug a little bit of the massive black hole that is part of being in an underground rock band. \u00a0That is, after all, where the inspiration for this strip comes from... and where my heart is. \u00a0So, you\u0027ll also be supporting (indirectly) independent alternative music...\u003cbr\u003eiv) vegan ice-cream. \u00a0It doesn\u0027t buy itself, y\u0027know...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim: updates and new stuff every couple of weeks *on average* (with more stuff for higher-donating patrons) ... The reason I say \"on average\" is because, as an active musician and artist (plus \"day job\"**) with projects in different countries - life is hectic and schedule varies, so sometimes, like when I\u0027m on tour or whatever, it may not be practical to get out new stuff if I don\u0027t have enough stored up... but other times I may be on a real sprint! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee you soon... or... ah, you know the rest ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnt\u00e9\u003cbr\u003ex\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*the book... which is actually \"The Book\" in my head... has evolved from the original concept of just a collection of (newer) \"D.I.Y. TRYING\" strips, to include old tour diaries, posters/flyers, stories, thoughts, contributions from our peers and friends and associates in the underground scene over last decade and a half...\u003cbr\u003e** more accurately known as \"whenever-I-get-round-to-doing-it-job\", but perhaps that\u0027s too pedantic... ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
