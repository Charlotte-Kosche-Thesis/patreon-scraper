    "summary": "Welcome to the Abnormal Mapping podcast network Patreon! We\u0027re a network focused on media criticism and good shows from marginal creators. We\u0027ve been putting out podcasts since 2013, and in 2017 decided that to expand our efforts we would launch the Patreon you see before you today. We exist entirely off of the support of our audience, and most of our shows wouldn\u0027t even exist without the efforts people have already made in supporting our network. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only are we a podcast network, but we\u0027ve also attempted to make Abnormal Mapping into a community, be that through our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/eEe28QJ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003enetwork discord\u003c/a\u003e or our goal to provide no-cost hosting to other like-minded people who would desire to make a podcast of their very own (more on that later). We want to create the podcast network we want to see in the world, something curious and invested in queer and progressive criticism and bringing together others who want the same. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Are We, and Why Are We Here:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbnormal Mapping was founded and is run by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/em_being\"\u003eEm Marko\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/headfallsoff\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJackson Tyler\u003c/a\u003e. We host and produce most of our shows, run the Patreon, write articles, and generally try to pretend like we\u0027re more than just the two of us. This is basically the equivalent of both of us having a part time job! We\u0027d suggest not making your hobbies your work, but it\u0027s doing okay for us so far. We\u0027re also joined by an array of other hosts and co-hosts that give their time and energy to casts hosted on the network. It\u0027s hard to schedule shows, and we\u0027re thankful to the efforts of everyone who helps us make the shows we have, have had, and will potentially have in the future. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first year on Patreon has been incredible so far, as we\u0027ve gone from just a video game podcast to an array of shows that all reflect our ethos of good, fun, accessible critical podcasts. There\u0027s a show for nearly every taste, and hopefully in the future there will be something for literally everyone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Shows\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what are the shows? Here are our extant shows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbnormal Mapping\u003c/strong\u003e - Our flagship show! A game club podcast we specifically designed to be accessible to people who haven\u0027t been drowning in games culture for their entire lives. Every month, we play a game and do a close read on our experiences, it\u0027s context, and how it fits into games now looking back. All of our episodes are evergreen and disconnected from the hype cycle, so any episode can be your first episode! You can find Abnormal Mapping at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://thebestgame.club\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethebestgame.club\u003c/a\u003e and a list of all the games we\u0027ve covered can be found\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.abnormalmapping.com/games\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecond Officer Slog\u003c/strong\u003e - We both love Star Trek, so much so that it was derailing our original podcast. Easy fix: let\u0027s make a Star Trek show! And so was born Second Officer Slog, a show about watching some episodes and reading one of the hundreds of Star Trek books and telling you just how far the final frontier goes when you\u0027re not on TV anymore. Allow us to be your guide through the ridiculous world of Star Trek fiction, no prior reading required. Comics, movie novelizations, awful short story collections? All can be found at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://startrekpodcast.space\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estartrekpodcast.space\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Amory Score\u003c/strong\u003e - The band Coheed and Cambria is known for two things: one, having a singer with a really high voice, and two, someone saying \u201cdo you know all their songs have a story?\u201d every time someone mentions them. Have you ever wanted to learn what that story is? Never fear, Jackson and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/yerfriendmolly\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMolly\u003c/a\u003e break down the lore track by track, and it is as hilarious and terrible as you would think. Spoilers: two children are dead by the end of the first song. It only kicks off more from there. To embark upon the journey, and see select panels of the tie-in comic, then head to:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ineedmayo.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eineedmayo.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNovel Not New\u003c/strong\u003e - Every month\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/jbu3\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eJen Unkle\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/sixdettmar\"\u003eSix Dettmar\u003c/a\u003e, and Em all gather in comfy chairs to talk through the most literary form of video games: the visual novel. The quieter sister of Abnormal Mapping, Novel Not New is a deep dive into a genre that gets very little coverage in the gaming circles we keep. We argue about anime tropes, reflect on who to date, and generally seek to find the endings that speak to our hearts. You can find Novel Not New at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://readinggames.online\"\u003ereadinggames.online\u003c/a\u003e and see the games covered in our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.abnormalmapping.com/games\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egame gallery\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Faves Would Never\u003c/strong\u003e - Em and their partner and long-time Abnormal Mapping guest\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/fridgebuzznow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDestiny Sturdivant\u003c/a\u003e get real on their couch once a week for a short talk about life, advice, movies, food, or anything else that comes up when they offer a peek into life as a ridiculous couple in the Midwest. This is our most casual show, our most personal show, and you can enjoy it at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://yourfaveswouldnever.fyi\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyourfaveswouldnever.fyi\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Great Gundam Project\u003c/strong\u003e - According to our calculations, there are 945 episodes of the long running anime franchise Mobile Suit Gundam. And guess what: Em and Jackson are going to watch every single one. Hitting every wednesday for any and all patreon subscribers, we watch two episodes of anime every week and break down our feelings on them for you all. Newcomers are taking the ride with us, and fans of Gundam are enjoying our hilariously incorrect theories in the face of not knowing forty years of lore. If you\u2019re a Gundam fan, come on down to our \u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/DNZxfsF\"\u003ediscord and hang out in Gundam Spoilers\u003c/a\u003e, and join in on the dramatic irony. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Shows\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond those, we have a show on the horizon which will be launching soon:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRepertory Screenings\u003c/strong\u003e - We love movies, even if going to the cinema to see the latest releases is often too expensive and too frustrating to do on the regular. So join Em and real-life film critic Kyle Turner for a monthly double bill of movies as we have a watch, have a chat, and talk about all the ins and outs of the silver screen. Repertory Screenings is nearly ready to launch, and will probably be an evolving show during its first year, but get in early on the action at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://repertoryscreenings.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003erepertoryscreenings.com\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Was That About Free Podcast Hosting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m glad you asked! We\u0027ve been very fortunate to have Abnormal Mapping not only pay for itself but allow us to get a website good enough to support more shows than we have the physical capacity to produce. So we figured we would pay it forward and give people a place to put their podcasts that wouldn\u0027t cost any money and is reliable. Podcasting is a good populist medium that should be for everyone, but the one big cost is absolutely hosting on something that isn\u0027t archive.org, so we\u0027re happy to be the home for shows that need a place to stay, with nearly no strings attached. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d think you\u0027d have a good fit for our network, then\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.abnormalmapping.com/join-our-network\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e for everything you need to know. If you clear the very light guidelines then we\u0027d be more than happy to give you a space to host your show! We already have one great show,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://firesidefriends.net\"\u003eFireside Friends\u003c/a\u003e, hosted by long-time friends of Abnormal Mapping Ryan Persaud, Allen Ibrahim, and Kaity Marie.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything Else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbsolutely! Your money not only helps support the site and keep Em and Jackson housed and fed, it also gets you an array of great rewards. You can see the rewards in the side bar, but I\u0027m happy to spell them out for you here too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$1 (one dollar) -\u003c/strong\u003e this gets you The Great Gundam Project, a weekly podcast where Jackson and Em watch all of Mobile Suit Gundam two episodes at a time and report back on how we feel about Spacenoid liberation and whether or not Gelgoogs are cool. We are already scheduled to be doing this podcast until 2026, when we\u0027ll undoubtedly begin a classic Dr Who show or something equally ludicrous (don\u0027t hold us to this). If you want a sample of The Great Gundam Project we have two free episodes for the beginning of Mobile Suit Gundam and Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam that you can find\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIJvB9Tu_gg\u0026amp;t=123s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TSfqsigiW4s\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$5 (five dollars) -\u003c/strong\u003e every Saturday Jackson and Em trade off writing the Patreon Letters, a series of informal criticism, essays, and the odd bit of fiction about media and life. Previous topics have covered new games we\u0027d never cover on Abnormal Mapping, living under late capitalism, discourse on Star Wars, and many other things besides. The odd Patreon Letter finds itself free on our Medium (you can see the ones released so far\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/abnormal-mapping/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e), but we\u0027re proud of all of them and think they\u0027re writing worth supporting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$10 (ten dollars) - \u003c/strong\u003ewe\u0027re launching a NEW PODCAST at this tier. People always say they enjoy our rapport as hosts and wish we\u0027d just goof around and so we\u0027re bringing you VoIP Life! Once every two weeks we\u0027ll offer you things that hit the cutting room floor, good times goofing around on Skype, and other weird things that would never make our more formal shows. We\u0027ve literally never interacted in person and thus our entire friendship has been over Skype and Slack and Discord, so we\u0027ll keep the microphones on a little longer and offer you the best dumb time we can mustre.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e$20 (twenty dollars) -\u003c/strong\u003e People love our podcasts. Some people love them so much they want to wear them, like a fur coat. If you\u0027re that person you can be on any of our podcasts for the low low cost of $20 a month for six months. We\u0027ll let you pick the podcast, pick the topic, and create on of our shows where you\u0027re our special guest or\u2014if you\u0027re not comfortable podcasting\u2014we talk about the thing you\u0027ve set us on. This is an expensive tier, but we think our shows are worth it, and we have loved having every guest we\u0027ve had on in the past. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s everything! Thank you so much for your consideration and your support, and we hope you get as much from our many shows as we get from producing them for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
