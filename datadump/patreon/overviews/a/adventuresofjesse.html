While not many would also consider the Pacific Crest Trail a balanced lifestyle, I\u0027m sure many of you have had to make the choice between your job and your personal life many times, and that is what I\u0027m doing now. Most people hiking the PCT have already been through hell and back and are looking for answers. Or scenery. Or something. They\u0027re also some of the nicest people you\u0027ll ever meet.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, here I go. Meanwhile, I would like to give you all a front seat to my adventure. After the end of the PCT, I will get some nice photos (I\u0027m packing a nice camera!) and possibly a film uploaded. In the meantime, if you\u0027d like to support me you can do so here at Patreon, and I humbly thank you. You can live vicariously through my experiences. You can pick my brain and show your interest from the comfort of your chair by sending me messages and following me along the trail. You can gain access to a life you may not know anything about, and maybe that will open up some doors for you, too. Or you can just pledge to buy photos. Whatever the case, entertainment is sure to follow!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eCheck out some of my past photos at my photo site!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.adventuresofjesse.com/\"\u003ehttp://www.adventuresofjesse.com/\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI specialize in nature photography and stitching panoramas (have not uploaded panoramas yet).
