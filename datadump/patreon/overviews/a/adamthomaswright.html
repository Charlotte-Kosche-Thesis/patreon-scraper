I\u2019m Adam.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.adamthomaswright.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Adam_Thomas_Wright_70_col.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have worked in TV, radio and film since I was 8. As a child actor, this has always been very exciting.  I always found my way around the crew asking questions and chatting with the gaffers or the DOP. I was keen to learn all aspects of filming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I reached 16 years old I hit \u201cthat point\u201d where I was too tall to be cast as a kid but I looked too young to be an older teenager. I was also in the GCSE year at school and had loads of revision.  Producers are not keen to cast kids doing their GCSE\u2019s either.  During this period, I decided to do more filming.  I had been playing around with making my own videos since I was about 12 (some of which you can see on the blog) and decided to become more professional.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs well as news about our latest short film, The Drive, you can also get exclusive access to my blogs which contain interesting behind the scenes stories, pictures and anecdotes from my child acting career.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eI teamed up with a friend, Tom, who is also interested in filmmaking and last year we made our first short film; \u201cReminiscence\u201d was a bitter sweet tale of growing old.  I created the campaign and designed the posters and researched all the film festivals we could afford to go into. We were delighted to be screened in several international film festivals and now I want to make more films.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have finished my exams and I am excited to be preparing for our second short film (\u201cThe Drive\u201d) which will be a 15 minute short.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DF0koPXXkAAzEhS.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have sort of exhausted my mum\u0027s, friends\u2019 and relatives\u2019 generosity and then I was told about Patreon.  This seems a wonderful method of raising funds as you are being supported by people who are interested in you and they want you to succeed and be part of the journey.\u003cbr\u003eIt would be fantastic if people would follow me and be a part of this adventure and help to make this venture successful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI researched hiring equipment and went through all the budgeting, but after much thought it became clear that this would be almost impossible, as the daily costs were too high and there was so much that could go wrong: the weather and the availability of the actors who are willing to offer their services as friends. You can\u2019t expect them to turn down a proper paying job. Also, myself, I couldn\u2019t turn down an audition or a role if it clashed with the dates for hiring equipment. Therefore, I decided to go for it and put together my own equipment. I decided to spend my savings on a Canon C100, which is the best camera I could afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll sorts of extra equipment is needed. For instance, a camera stabiliser, lights and sound equipment, as well as post production stuff (music, colour grading etc.) Then you have to budget for the campaign, posters, screening, actor\u2019s expenses, food, the list just goes on and on (and on).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eWith your help I can achieve this and I look forward to writing all about the progress!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://adamthomaswright.com/\"\u003eMy Website\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eA Big thank you to my current Patrons.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

Last year, I made a short film with my friend, which was screened at several international film festivals. I realised we needed to improve our quality, and my 7 year old DSLR wasn\u0027t cutting it anymore. Over the last 6 months, I have managed to beg, steal and borrow to be able to get my hands on a Canon C100. But I can\u0027t get any further without your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI intend to write about my experiences as both an actor and filmmaker, which will include anecdotes and behind the scenes info, with blogs and vlogs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I have a camera, I need a whole load of other equipment to really bring my stories to life. I need you to be a part of this. You can share in the experience, and I will be offering many engaging and interactive rewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you for reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdam\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://adamthomaswright.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
