So I guess your first question is probably \"who is this stunningly attractive guy?!\" Well, I\u0027m Jared and I run the YouTube channel Avalanche Reviews. I\u0027ve been making reviews, commentary and other gaming related content since 2011, and I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Being able to flex my creative muscles and produce content that I\u0027m proud of is a privilege as far as I\u0027m concerned, and if you\u0027re reading this, there is a good chance that you have helped me get to where I am today.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do You Need My Support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlaying games, thinking about them in a critical manner and figuring out how to make my thoughts appealing and digestible has become a passion for me, but like most of you, I have to work a full time job as well. Even though I want to spend much of my time writing reviews, capturing game footage, or editing video, there simply aren\u0027t enough hours in the day. By contributing to my Patreon you\u0027ll be giving me the freedom I need to cut back on my work schedule, so I can dedicate myself to what I really love. Hopefully with your help, I can grow this channel and take my passion as far it can possibly go\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Is My Money Going Towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating quality content isn\u0027t exactly cheap and I put almost every cent I earn into this channel, your contributions will be no different. Whatever I make here on Patreon will go directly into purchasing capture devices, a better microphone, video scalers, cables, games, and all of the little things that help me produce the highest quality game reviews I can. Upgrading my computer so it can better handle editing HD video and capturing modern PC games is also a priority.\u00a0\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 What If I Can\u0027t Afford To Contribute?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen guys, I understand what it\u0027s like having to struggle, just to make ends meet. I know not everyone will be able/willing to contribute, and that\u0027s ok. My content is always going to be free. If you enjoy my videos, but aren\u0027t comfortable with contributing, your views, comments and likes, mean just as much to me. You guys are 100 percent responsible for where I am and my passion for this channel. Regardless of whether or not I meet my goal here on patreon, I will be forever grateful to all of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "Hi, I\u0027m Jared! I\u0027ve been running the Avalanche Reviews youtube channel since 2011. This has been a sort of a dream come true for me, because it lets me not only stretch my creativity well beyond what I thought was possible, but it also lets me share the games with as many people as possible. I like to think that I bring a relatively unique perspective to a youtube gaming community that is packed with content creators. On top of being able to think critically about a subject I\u0027m passionate about, I also get to have discussions with people from around the world. I try my best to respond to each and every comment I get, and because of this, I have built up a dedicated following. My viewers provided me with more support than I have ever had before, but they\u0027re also not afraid to call me on my mistakes. With a 5000 person strong crowd cheering me on, I feel like I could do this for the rest of my life, and hopefully patreon enables me to do just that.\u00a0",
