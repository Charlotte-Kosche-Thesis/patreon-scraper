    "summary": "Hi everyone my name is Adam Hole I\u0027m an Australian blues slide guitarist, Ive been touring now for over 10 years or so and my life has been all about music, that\u0027s all I know, that\u0027s who I am, I love it, I like creating music and\u00a0playing live, I love making people happy. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo the reason for writing this is that Im moving forward with the times, the new way that music is presented and the new way that musicians are surviving. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePlaying shows, recording albums, releasing music has\u00a0changed over time, it doesn\u0027t make money for the musician to sustain what they do to keep going, I have done this for such a long time now and I\u2019ve noticed each year that goes by it\u0027s\u00a0getting harder and harder for musicians to survive in what they do, we are doing all this independently these days. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here we are at \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/AdamHole\"\u003ePatreon.com\u003c/a\u003e, I was thinking of ways to make money doing what allowed me to give music Back to you, I see other bands and artists doing same thing, this is a new way for me so lets see what happens.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eI have been playing music all my life, I was born a shy quiet\u00a0introverted type of person and my way of expressing was through music, through guitar playing. I taught myself how to play guitar as a young kid, ever since then i found who I was, I used the guitar as my voice to express to people in society how I felt or for expressing some sort of emotion and a lot of people had connected with that in me. So that\u0027s who I am, that\u0027s what I do and I\u0027m still trying to do that today and will continue doing this till the day i drop dead. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a hard road, and the reason I\u0027m doing this is that the music scene has changed a lot over the years, I wish I was playing music back in the seventies and eighties where people come in droves to venues to gigs etc, anything to listen to music, to buy merchandise, or to buy records to support the artists. These days no one buys CDs, sales are dropping so much because there is no CD players in technology anymore, (a New computer has no CD drive in it). So the scene is changing, the technology is changing, what do people do? they don\u0027t even buy digital downloads mp3\u2019s, that\u0027s even dropping off, So the new thing out is streaming music, everyone is streaming music from so many different websites and I can tell you musicians don\u0027t really see much payment from this at all. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eUs musicians have to find other means to make money to do what we do to give the music back to you guys, we do get paid for playing live venues but that is a very minimal amount of money these days (so many reasons for this also), travel costs, driving hours and hours between venues, fuel costs, accommodation, repairs on\u00a0the tour van etc. and thats only one side of it, theres also rehearsal, recording, production fees, musicians to pay etc. this list can go on and on. Usually the money we do make goes back into the music to try and keep it moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBands and lot of artists all around the world are trying\u00a0to find a way to continue to write music to record music and to release music, how do they do that now? with help from you guys, this new way of sustaining us musicians to continue what we do is to have a subscription-based system, it\u0027s not like a GoFundMe site or a Kickstarter site, it\u0027s an ongoing subscription based service that you will be supporting us to continue to write, to continue to play, to continue to create\u00a0music to give to you so you can listen, watch and enjoy. We love music this is all we want to do in life to just create music for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe enjoyment I get is seeing you enjoying the music that I give, that\u0027s the connection we have, I love to give and that\u2019s what makes me feel good its my drug playing\u00a0music to you, and you give me that feedback helping me give more, Its like a snowball affect.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eSo become my Patreon, it\u2019s an ongoing support that you just pay whatever you choose monthly, you can pay anything you like it\u0027s up to you, and if you choose to do that and help me you will have have all these benefits and perks (rewards). I have a whole list of things that you can get, from all my albums to unreleased recordings, videos, Demo songs etc, lots of things that is not released to the public, you will also have an inside scoop to it all before anyone else plus more depending on how much you want to subscribe to each month.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIts a way to bring you guys closer to me and my music personally, I want you to feel a part of the music, feel like you are keeping music alive, I can\u0027t wait to make this thing one big family. I thank you so much, I hope you get what you need out of this as I will definitely get what I need to help produce, create music and play music for YOU, So I hope you get on board\u00a0and I thank you all very much.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/AdamHole\"\u003ewww.Patreon.com/AdamHole\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
