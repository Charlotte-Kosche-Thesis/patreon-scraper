I am creating \u003cstrong\u003esymphonic orchestra covers\u003c/strong\u003e of pop music and in fact I am able to create symphonic version of pretty much anything. If you are interested in this kind of stuff, you can support me right here, on Patreon, which is perfectly designed for that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI will post new video with symphonic cover once or twice a month, not more often. If you decide to support me, you will be charged for each of these covers and of course you will get your reward. That\u2019s it :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYour funds help with the cost of editing and producing the cover, as well as hardware and software equipment, especially virtual instruments. Creating full orchestra arrangement is very time-consuming and the more time I will have for it, the better the result will be.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nStill here? Alright, thanks for your interest! Please watch my campaign video now, as it will reveal more from the process of creating of my music. I also explain what exactly can you expect from me and my music videos :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have time to watch my campaign video, just check out one of my previous work to get the idea how my covers might sound like:\u003cbr\u003ehttps://youtu.be/rY4sxLpWF2o\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can now choose one of available options to start supporting me instantly. Of course your patronage is always optional and I don\u2019t want you to force yourself to participate, although I offer some rewards you will simply not be able to resist to :) If you can\u2019t afford to pledge anyway, don\u2019t worry. My YouTube channel will always be publicly accessible and I will create awesome music even for you, always.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you so much for your support, it means a world to me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAntonin"
