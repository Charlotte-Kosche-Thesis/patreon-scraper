Thanks for stopping by.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/wFuPyWc.png\" style=\"width: 284px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nHello! My name is Anthony Cavallo, and I make videos on video games from all generations and try be funny while doing so. Huzzah! I\u0027m honestly just a huge jokester in real life anyway, so combining that with my love for videos games made this seem like a perfect match.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003e- AntDude -\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nThe AntDude videos are the main selling point of my channel. They\u0027re scripted and edited videos that take a look at single or multiple videos games, sometimes some ROM hacks, and just trying to entertain as many people as I can while describing what the games are all about. They vary in length, they\u0027re fast paced, and the only thing you can expect in each episode is me probably looking dumb.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-MuER-31SI\" width=\"640\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI also occasionally do Top 10 lists, Rapid Reviews which look at newer games in a short amount of time, and more in the future! I also do a Let\u0027s Play channel for those who are fans of that style of content as well!\u00a0\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/AntDudePlays\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClick here to take a look\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch1\u003e- Why Patreon -\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nWith Patreon, I want to make sure my video production is the best it possibly can be. Every video is made, from start to finish, by myself, so the pledges from Patreon are an excellent way to support me for the work I\u0027ve put in, while getting a look into what I\u0027m working on before anybody else does.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd the best part, you can pledge whatever you want! Minimum is $1, and if that\u0027s all you can do, that\u0027s not a problem at all and it\u0027s always extremely appreciated.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is just to be able to do what I love doing, which is making content that people find entertaining. With the additional support, I will be able to make that content better and make sure the future of my channel is worth watching.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you all for the support, and thanks for watching!"
