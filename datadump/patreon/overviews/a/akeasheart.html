    "summary": "I love helping people realize that the difficult circumstances they may face in life may not always be their fault.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was 8, I knew I was a different child. I had questions that I was afraid to ask and a wandering mind. At 8 years old I was told by a childhood friend and neighbor that my biological mother was killed by my biological father. I\u0027ve spent most of my adult life realizing that my teenage years I suffered in silence by not asking questions I needed to prepare me for adulthood. I realized that my mother\u0027s death affected me tremendously and even though I had people in my life who loved and cared for me the emptiness and feelings of not knowing were what would plague my mind. As I matured I realized that my calling was to pour encouragement in to the lives of at risk teenagers who may have experienced some trauma due to their environments and poverty levels. I\u0027m grateful for all of the experiences I have had and now understand that I was placed in situations to be able to help someone else who may be faced with the same scenario in life.\u00a0 Now, as I embark on the next phase of my life, I want to continue to do the work of creating educational workshops, inspiring teenagers and young adults,motivating and encouraging resilient teens to show them that through love, consistency, and hard work they can become successful citizens\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBiography:\u003cbr\u003eAkea Pearson is the founder and operator of Akea\u2019s Heart\nInc.; a nonprofit organization that services adjudicated youth, at risk teens,\nand teenage parents. She is also the author of the children\u2019s book \u201cMommy wake\nup\u201d a book about domestic violence told from a witnessing child\u2019s perspective.\nShe graduated with her Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Human Services in 2012. Akea has\nhad a passion for working with teens and young adults for as long as she can\nremember. She is currently enrolled in Rosemont College pursing her Counseling\nTherapy degree while also working as a domestic violence counselor. \u201cI love to\nhelp people realize that what they are going through is not always  their fault, and that there are resources\navailable to help them\u201d Akea believes that by encouraging our youth to do\nbetter that they can learn to make better decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
