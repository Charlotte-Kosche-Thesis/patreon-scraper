In turn, I\u0027m community supported, not commercially supported. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI license most of my work under CC BY-SA, which means other people can use it creatively, even for commercial purposes, without having to ask my permission first. I am committed to this model because I know from my work as a church musician just how limiting \"traditional\" copyright can be. Sometimes I release music under a more restrictive CC BY-SA-NC license which means commercial exploitation of the work isn\u0027t allowed, but non-profit use is fine; if I do this, it\u0027s usually because the writer of the lyrics is more comfortable with that license.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you pledge, you\u0027ll be helping me spend more time honing my craft and composing music for everyone to enjoy. I\u0027ll keep releasing my work under CC BY-SA or CC BY-SA-NC, so you won\u0027t only be supporting me, but also other musicians. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e"
