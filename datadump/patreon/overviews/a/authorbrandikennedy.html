For me, writing is passion that\u0027s safe and love that\u0027s dependable. It\u0027s therapy and art - painting and sculpting with words. Writing has opened doors to healing, and has provided a valuable avenue for me to learn to know and (finally) accept myself - who I am, who I want to be, and what I want from those around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlogging has allowed me to grow and strengthen the resolve that keeps me trying no matter how many times I want to quit, and exploring life through \u003cem\u003efiction\u003c/em\u003e has taught me that despite the difficulties I\u0027ve faced, I CAN forge a new path for my life and my family.

Patrons on this page would be taking a direct and undeniable part in making that happen through helping to support my family as well as covering the expenses of continuing to pursue publication of my writings. This in itself is a long list of things to cover, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eupdating the graphic design software I use to create my blog and social media graphics\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eproducts I purchase to give away or review on the blog or social media\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eoutings and writing-related travel expenses\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eadvertising - through the use of boosted posts, paid placements, etc.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe valued PA who helps me promote my writing elsewhere on the web, thereby giving me more time to write\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esubscription to the software I use (Microsoft Word) to actually get the novel-writing done\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eeditors who look over my work before publication\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe graphic designer in charge of making my covers beautiful (and marketable)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eand yes,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eliving expenses for my family, which allows me to write because I don\u0027t have to stress over how I\u0027m going to keep the bills paid.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the truth is, my goals are bigger than a Slacker Radio subscription. \u003cem\u003e(And I can prove it - look in the goals section of this page, where you can click through and see what I\u0027m hoping to accomplish here.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once found myself pretty much homeless, and at that time I was unable to find any help for the situation I was in. I couldn\u0027t even get into women\u0027s shelters because I was in too messed-up of a situation, and I literally had several different places tell me, \"We\u0027re sorry, there really aren\u0027t programs for situations like yours at this time.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt left me lost and uncertain, but also with a dream to make sure other young women never have to hear those words. In my novel, Fighting For Freedom, I wrote about a women\u0027s shelter that will take anybody. Doesn\u0027t matter if they dropped out of high school, if they\u0027re disabled, if they have literally no potential at all. If they\u0027re going to be a long-term resident, if they\u0027re going to need loads of help ... I wrote the kind of Safe House I couldn\u0027t find, the kind that opens its doors to even the most complicated cases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as I wrote that book, I nurtured a dream. The dream of actually unlocking the door to a real live Safe House, the dream of setting such a program in motion. The dream of filling the fictional Safe House I imagined with real-life women in need of a hand to hold as they find their way forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my most steadfast hope that the growth of this page (and my writing in general) would eventually help me to fund that dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, there is - of course - absolutely no obligation to pledge any support here, and those who do choose to try it out can always cancel with no problems and no hard feelings. My novels (including the one mentioned above) are available on all the major markets and my blog will always be free to access ... but those who support me here are the real true heroes of my little world, the official sponsors of Team Kennedy, and the backbone of the Undaunted community I\u0027m hoping to build.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRIGHT.
