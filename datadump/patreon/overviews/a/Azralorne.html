    "summary": "Hello there! You may be wondering what I\u0027m doing here. I have been drawing for a long time, I\u0027ve off and on sold my art, taken commissions, and submitted to publications. At one point several years ago I stopped drawing to do crafting instead. I\u0027ve submitted to the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://desertbus.org/about/\"\u003eDesert Bus Craftalong\u003c/a\u003e for years now, which has always been a wonderful experience. I opened an Etsy shop and made stuffed animals and other sewn items, as well as jewelry from clay, and whatever else I wanted to try my hand at. But, eventually the enjoyment of crafting faded, sales dried up, and I wanted to move on. I wanted to draw again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow the problem arises that I am out of practice. I am trying to relearn some things, forget some others, and generally improve my abilities. I have had some rough times the last few years, and while I crave the creative outlet, depression has taken it\u0027s toll. I\u0027m working to get better, and through this process I thought \"Why not open a patreon?\" Especially after the encouragement of my wonderful friend \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/geardrops/overview\"\u003eCarrie\u003c/a\u003e, and being inspired by her \"give if you wish\" model of patreon, I decided to go for it. I enjoy the idea of this being a centralized location for things I work on, and I want to use it to motivate myself to keep trying.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, all that being said! \u003cstrong\u003eWhat is my plan here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI aim to make at least one finished piece a month and post it here. I will no require money for it to be viewed, as I want this to be a place for anyone to see my work, at least for now. I would love to get to a place in my life and career that I could cut hours at my day job, take commissions, or maybe even have a table at a con? But these are long term dreams that I want to work towards. What I want most is the backing of friendship! So sharing my art or this patreon page, leaving me a like or a comment, all of that is just as great as any money I could receive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to throw me some cash? \u003c/strong\u003eGo for it! I have a monthly subscription to Adobe for my Photoshop CC usage and this could be a great way to help pay for it or even increasing my monthly account to include other programs like Illustrator, and I\u0027d love to get more supplies for doing things on paper like copic style markers and what not...so any money will be greatly appreciated and go towards me practicing my art through various mediums and methods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I start to receive money, I would also love to use any contributors opinions when I hit a rut, ask for suggestions, other stuff like that. Maybe I\u0027ll even look at sending something to people?! But this is all a daydream of what could be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am so grateful to have wonderful people around me who see in me and my work the talent and worth to keep going, even when I don\u0027t. If you have any questions, feel free to poke me on twitter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Azralorne\"\u003e@Azralorne\u003c/a\u003e!"
