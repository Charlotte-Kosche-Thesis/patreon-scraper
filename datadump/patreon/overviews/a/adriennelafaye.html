A crazy idea, right? Look, I\u0027ve never experienced anything like it, the book pretty much was completed in my head, and I couldn\u0027t wait to write. I wrote the entire book in two weeks. So you see I can\u0027t let this book get dusty on a bookshelf. My charge is to create this book and make it available for children everywhere. \u003cstrong\u003eTitled; DREAM JUMPERS the INHERITANCE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am; with this\u003cem\u003e \u003cstrong\u003efantastic Middle-Grade story\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e I\u0027ve \u003cstrong\u003ewritten fifty-thousand words\u003c/strong\u003e, and I already can envision the sequel. Yea, yea, I can imagine what you\u0027re thinking, is it any good though? I conducted a Beta testing, and every one of the testers loved the book. Also, I\u0027ve had it edited, and now, I found a top of the line editor who has influence in the writing world who will help me find the right agent and so on...!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need your help not only to pay for hiring staff,\u003c/strong\u003e professional marketing, creating a website that signs folks up to prepay for a copy of the book, cost to publish a illustrated book of \u003cstrong\u003eDJTH\u003c/strong\u003e, travel expenses to promote the book. As an illustrator, I also need time (and relief from scrambling to pay the bills) to draw my illustrations for the book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon is a way you can support me monthly or with a one-time pledge\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u2019ve talked to many folks who are patrons of the art, and\u00a0they want to support an artist but didn\u2019t know how. Consider this, and it\u0027s your chance to be my patron of the arts and help a struggling artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve painted since I was a child and finally seven years ago I was able to become a full-time artist with the aid of my \u003cstrong\u003eGenius Wife \u003c/strong\u003ewho believes in me and lets me paint with wild abandonment. I\u0027m asking you to trust me also. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt takes real money to be a successful artist or writer\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027ve been chosen to create. No one told me that the more money you have, the better you can represent yourself, and acquire the better editor to help you get published. I get it now!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an artist who has always had a passion for painting, writing and illustrating. My goal is to draw at least 20 illustrations and publish the book in six months or more, and I\u0027ll need a lot of time for that, and time is money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ePLEASE CLICK ON LINK BELOW AND MAKE A SMALL OR LARGE ONE TIME OR MONTHLY PLEDGE.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/adriennelafaye\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/adriennelafaye\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to thank all of my supporters in advance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e~Adrienne La Faye~\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eTO PURCHASE LA FAYE PAINTING\u0027S CLICK ON LINK BELOW\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.adriennelafayeart.com\"\u003ewww.adriennelafayeart.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u0026lt;iframe style=\"width:525px; height:343px;\" src=\"//e.issuu.com/embed.html#31188903/53516663\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QLV7KGUanz0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
