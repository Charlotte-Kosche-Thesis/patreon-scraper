It\u0027s always been a lot of fun to run it, because I legitimately find the Nidoran family interesting. More importantly, I do it not only to make the line have a much farther reaching appeal by using every potential means at my disposal (and injecting a lot of personality into it), but I also do it, and continue to, for the fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDonations aren\u0027t necessary, the site will continue to run until I overdose on Nido venom, probably. However, they are always a nice gesture of appreciation for something or someone, and I suppose, finding the worth or value of that something or someone. If you find any of this crazy content of value, I have to say, that\u0027s really awesome of you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, they mean that I can spend more time on this stuff, as opposed to worrying about eating and having to find additional work/get more hours. I really love making content, and would be all in to spend more time worry-free on it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, I hope to keep Aqua Bunny fun with all sorts of things to see and do. I appreciate your support, and any thoughts you may have as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
