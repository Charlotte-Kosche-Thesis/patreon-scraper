When a major device is first released I will go through and write some basic guides for things like booting into recovery mode and doing factory resets. Then I\u0027ll dig into the device more and write about how to root the smartphone or tablet as well as other hacks like how to install a custom recovery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce those are out of the way I get to go through the software and teach readers about the ins and outs of what is available. These are categorized as tips on AndroidExplained.com and they are my way of teaching people about the phone or tablet that they have in their hands. Not everyone has the time or the desire to learn all their is about their new gadget and this is how I help them out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy tutorials are broken down into step by steps guides that walk you through everything you need to know. I\u0027ve received thousands of comments telling me how easy the most complex tasks are thanks to my tutorials and this is where I feel that I excel. Instead of you having to spend hours learning how to do something, I write it all out and teach you the steps along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat I Can Do\u003c/h1\u003eI have started doing basic video tutorials to be included in my written tutorials, but I\u0027m using very basic equipment to record audio and video (just my Nexus 6P with a cheap mic).\u00a0At the first tier, I will be able to purchase more devices so that I can create even more tutorials, tips, tricks and guides for the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can get to the second tier, then I can purchase better equipment so that my tips and tutorial videos both look and sound better. This tier will also allow me to dedicate more time to Android Explained, and that will enable me to put out 4 to 5 more tutorials each week. As it is now, I can only post one each day and this means it can take me a month or two before I have completed guides for a device. Being able to post more than one per week day will allow me to get to newer devices faster than I can right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe last tier here will allow me to be completely funded by the community and this will mean that I can remove all of the ads that I have placed around my content. This goes for the website as well as the YouTube videos, and means that the content will be free from all distractions."
