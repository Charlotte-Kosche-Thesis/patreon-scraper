Each subject is instructed to smoke a joint with I Must Be Dead, and then converse on a wide variety of subject matter, ranging from sex to sex. The subject is also photographed during the interview, and then the photos are combined with the audio into an online video slideshow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/tZMzh6Z.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis project has evolved from many different expressions of the past. Including a talk show I Must Be Dead was involved in previously called The Fuckcast, where weed induced conversation was the goal of the show, leading to humorous stories and ideas. Also, the concept of photography in the digital age is to shoot more and show less, leading to a state of over editing and curation. A slideshow of all the images in their RAW format is leaving no layer between what was naturally captured, a full window into how one of I Must Be Dead\u0027s photoshoot looks before filtering. In addition besides just enjoying smoking pot with friends, I Must Be Dead has the desire to share \u00a0more of his own humor and life in a more expressive way than current social media delivers ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Jda0Mju.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Patreon Is\u00a0a subscription based storefront for any artist or creator. Limitless in possibility, and can be applied to any industry if the idea is good and subscribe-able, therefor controlling content quality for the longevity of it\u0027s funding. For I Must Be Dead this is a powerful tool in creating not only an evolving portrait series that all fans of photography could enjoy, but also a progressively funded way to make a living as an \u00a0Artist, instead of becoming a slave to a corporation of social media site. You can now directly fund your favorite creators, at any comfortable amount you like, and for a non contractual amount of time, Patreon is the future of store fronts on the internet, and therefor our lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"A Joint Conversation\" through Patreon provides I Must Be Dead fans the easiest and most direct way ever to support him and his desire to destroy himself through your enjoyment and entertainment.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
