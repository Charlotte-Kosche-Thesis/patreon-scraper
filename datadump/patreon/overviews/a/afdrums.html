    "summary": "Hello friends! I am a musician...more specifically a drummer.\u00a0From doing YouTube covers, being in a touring band, paying for drums, hardware, sticks, drumheads, travel, recording, filming, merch, promotion, food, bills, and everything in between is taxing and expensive. Its you guys who support me directly and those who send tweets, comment, share, email, come to shows, and much more that keep me going and believing in what I do. This is a place where if you love what I do and want to help more you can. You can be a direct part in everything I do as well as get some really cool stuff and exclusive rewards! I know that donating 1, 5, or 20 dollars a month is not easy and may even sound dumb to you and thats okay! All my YouTube content will always be free no matter what. This site is for the most hardcore of my fans, those who enjoy helping, friends and family who want to do more, or anyone who likes cool stuff! I encourage you to check out the Reward tiers I have and check out the cool stuff you can get like free merch, videos early, physical fan mail from me, and much more. Thank you sooooo much to everyone who has helped me get to where I am today as a drummer. If you want to help me get to the next level please consider becoming a Patron here today!!"
