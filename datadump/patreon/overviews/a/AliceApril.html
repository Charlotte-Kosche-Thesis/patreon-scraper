     "about": "Hi, my name is Alice. I am a songwriter, videographer, teacher and personal education activist. Do you have a vision for your life that you want to turn into a reality? Want to live your dreams despite of what happens in life, stay happy and inspired and most importantly loved? Welcome to my Patreon Page! Embrace your best self and watch your dreams come true here with me ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion is to share with you my love for music and personal education and show you the healing power that comes from following your dreams. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you join me - you embark on a journey of a Dream-Hacker ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy story:\u003cbr\u003eI was a shy girl from Kiev, Ukraine who had big dreams. One day I decided to go on a journey to make them a reality. And now that I am living my dreams, I want to share all the wonderful things I have learned with you, along with my music of course :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI discovered a huge passion for music at the very early age but it took a while to actually turn it into something more than just quietly playing in my room.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have learned that all the great things happen outside of my comfort zone, require hard work (that is why only small percentage of people succeed, those who don\u0027t give up) and also that you need to create your own comfort zone to go back to in order to have a happy environment despite of hardships that everyone has (each individual struggle is different, but there is not a person in the world who never had any struggles of some sort at all).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a few of my dreams that came true:\u003cbr\u003e1. I got brave enough to perform my songs on stage. My first public performance was at the local Cafe \u201cBoomerang\u201d. \u003cbr\u003e2. Got to record my songs professionally. First it was 2 EP\u0027s.\u003cbr\u003e3. I live in a wonderful town that has music, art, culture and everything I wanted to be a part of my life since I was a child. Who new this place for me would be Tulsa, Oklahoma :)\u003cbr\u003e4. Studied TV/Film in the University of Culture and Arts and Radio/Broadcasting at The Connecticut School of Broadcasting. Made friends in the industry.\u003cbr\u003e5. Had a blast as a part of CBS radio team. Was an on air talent, made some videos and helped out in promotion.\u003cbr\u003e6. Sang with one of my music heroes - Steven Tyler from Aerosmith during the Rock-n-Roll Fantasy Camp, which was an incredible experience! Met so many amazing musicians and got to learn from them. Co-wrote a song called \"Living A Dream\" with Bruce Kulick and our camp band. We recorded it at the Capital Records with Eddie Kramer\u00a0and performed at the legendary venue \u2013 Whiskey A Go Go.\u003cbr\u003e7.\u00a0I released my first album \u201cMy Way\u201d with one of my music heroes Share Ross (Vixen) and her husband Bam Ross (Dogs D\u0027Amour).\u003cbr\u003e8. Met an amazing man who I dearly love with all my heart.\u003cbr\u003e9. I work as a Video Director at The Joint, Hard Rock, camera operator and A/V Technician for SMG and have amazing video clients.\u003cbr\u003e10. Opened my own Music Teaching Studio \u2013 Alice April Academy.\u003cbr\u003e11. Lead a Dream Book Class at the Tulsa Day Center for an amazing Art Program - Works Of HeART.\u003cbr\u003e12. Host an annual celebration of Personal Education called NELLY Event.\u003cbr\u003e13. Joined a brand new Organization Unity Tree Gardens as Marketing and Public Relations member.\u003cbr\u003e14. Was invited to be the Head of Video Committee of Living Arts Tulsa.\u003cbr\u003eAnd I keep adding to my list :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLooking forward to serve YOU more doing what I love so much.\u003cbr\u003e",
