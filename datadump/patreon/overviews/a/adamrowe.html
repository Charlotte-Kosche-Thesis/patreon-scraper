Thanks for checking out this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou probably know me from the 70s Sci-Fi Art \u003ca href=\"http://70sscifiart.tumblr.com\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/70sscifiart\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, or \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/70sscifiart\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e page. I post 7+ times a day, so people tend to assume the art blog is run by a team of people, but it really is just me. It\u2019s doing well \u2014 over 400K followers across all social media and 7M impressions a month on Twitter \u2014 but since I don\u2019t earn a dime on it, it\u2019s tough to make time for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy day job is freelance writing. For Barnes and Noble, I\u2019ve written on \u003ca href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/how-one-misunderstanding-in-the-1870s-created-an-entire-sci-fi-subgenre/\"\u003ehow one misunderstanding in the 1870s created an entire sci-fi subgenre\u003c/a\u003e and I\u2019ve interviewed \u003ca href=\"http://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/how-one-mash-up-artist-got-legal-permission-to-pair-calvin-hobbes-with-dune/\"\u003ean internet mash-up artist who got legal permission from Bill Watterson\u2019s lawyers\u003c/a\u003e to pair Calvin and Hobbes with Dune. For Popular Mechanics, I once wrote \u003ca href=\"http://www.popularmechanics.com/culture/a19088/chris-foss-the-man-who-defined-the-look-of-sci-fi/\"\u003ea feature on legendary sci-fi artist Chris Foss\u003c/a\u003e. It\u2019s not all sci-fi; I\u2019ve written on tech topics like \u003ca href=\"http://www.idgconnect.com/blog-abstract/14738/bionic-exoskeletons-why-haven-replaced-wheelchairs\"\u003ewhy bionic exoskeletons haven\u0027t replaced wheelchairs\u003c/a\u003e and how \u003ca href=\"http://www.idgconnect.com/blog-abstract/21725/the-waking-dead-fashioned-nostalgia-push-vr\"\u003eThe Walking Dead could be the Pokemon Go of VR games\u003c/a\u003e. Wait, those are both kinda sci-fi. I guess I have a niche. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you might not know me from is \u003ca href=\"https://tinyletter.com/madddscience\"\u003emy newsletter Maddd Science\u003c/a\u003e. I recently launched it, and I\u2019m hoping it will curate articles on genre fiction and culture just as well as my art blog curates sci-fi art. \u003ca href=\"https://tinyletter.com/MadddScience/archive\"\u003eCheck out the archives here\u003c/a\u003e to see if you like it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd while I\u0027m listing things I do, I\u0027m also\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://forbes.com/sites/adamrowe1\"\u003ea Forbes contributor\u003c/a\u003e on the business of storytelling.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy start a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSame reason most people do. All the responsibilities of life make it hard for me to put in the research I need to keep an art blog running or to write on the topics I\u2019d prefer to cover. Any contribution isn\u2019t an expectation: I don\u2019t assume you\u2019ll do anything more than glance at my Twitter feed once in a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon might have \u003ca href=\"https://tech.co/patreon-payment-policy-2017-12\"\u003eits issues\u003c/a\u003e, but there\u2019s a reason \u003ca href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/28/16795090/internet-community-2017-post-mortem-tumblr-amino-drip-tinyletter\"\u003epeople call it\u003c/a\u003e the \u201ceconomic engine of the internet\u201d: It helps support all the weird online niches like me. If you really enjoy anything I do \u2014 writing, art blog, or newsletter \u2014 you can support me here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore specifically, I\u2019ll use the contributions to put a little more energy into 70s Sci-Fi Art and my writing career both. I\u2019ll be able to pay \u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/seventiesscifiart/\"\u003emy instagram account\u003c/a\u003e the attention it deserves, and I\u2019ll have the time to put together interesting posts like this \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/70sscifiart/status/913235761977114625\"\u003ecomparison of skull planets\u003c/a\u003e or this look at how much \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/70sscifiart/status/819697551230148608\"\u003eJack Kirby hates drawing ears\u003c/a\u003e or that time I identified the artist behind \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/thekidsin201/status/921864834714566657\"\u003esome wall art on Three\u2019s Company\u003c/a\u003e. I\u0027ll also be able to research and talk a little bit more about the history of the artists I usually just post images from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust sign up to automatically give me a buck or five once a month. As any freelancer will tell you, having a steady but small income is way less stressful than having a huge but erratic one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHey, curation is just reposting other people\u2019s stuff. Why do you deserve my money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I don\u2019t, exactly. If I deserved it, I would have charged you upfront. I just want to keep doing it, and could use the support. Not sure if I\u2019m worthy? Try this trick: Ask yourself if anything I do over the span of an average month ever gives you the same amount of satisfaction as a cup of coffee. If not, don\u2019t bother giving me anything and go buy coffee instead. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey, donating any amount will get you access to my Patreon stream, where I\u2019ll share notes, history tidbits and inside baseball facts. For instance, do you know there\u2019s a hidden message in my Twitter \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/70sscifiart\"\u003eprofile pic\u003c/a\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWait, what other benefits can I get here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to keep it simple, so I only have two tiers: You can donate just two bucks and get access to that Patreon stream, or you can donate five dollars a month and a monthly email update from me with news about what I\u2019m up to, downloadable short stories I\u2019ve created, and raffles for 70s sci-fi art collections or graphic novels. I\u2019d only recommend the five-dollar tier if you\u2019re interested in getting to know me and the kinds of things I create, like the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.superdamescomics.com/jill-trent--science-sleuth--1--print-edition-.html\"\u003ecomic book I wrote\u003c/a\u003e one time or a full-cast 30-episode fiction podcast I made once.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, there\u2019s a third tier listed on here, but it\u2019s only for those who feel like giving me twelve bucks a month out of the kindness of their heart, which is frankly a little ridiculous, so unless you dress like \u003ca href=\"https://www.google.com/search?biw=1366\u0026amp;bih=588\u0026amp;tbm=isch\u0026amp;sa=1\u0026amp;ei=t19RWq72L8b4jwTC7rKYCg\u0026amp;q=that+one+peanut+with+a+top+hat\u0026amp;oq=that+one+peanut+with+a+top+hat\u0026amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...884.1002.0.1357.2.2.0.0.0.0.89.89.1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.0.0....0.0MtcAkf2MV0\"\u003ethe Planters peanut mascot\u003c/a\u003e, feel free to ignore it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I don\u2019t wanna get a Patreon account?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo worries. \u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick\u0026amp;hosted_button_id=VKGBWYLUVT36U\"\u003eI also have a PayPal page\u003c/a\u003e that allows general or ongoing donations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho\u2019s the Maddd Science newsletter for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople who love genre fiction. People who want to get better at writing their own stories, or who want to try out a new medium. People who trawl Rotten Tomatoes every week to see if the latest review embargo is up yet. People who just want to explore culture through pop culture. Anyone who loves the art, nature, and history of storytelling, whether it\u2019s in books, video games, paintings, comics, indie films or the latest Netflix show.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy does it have such a dumb name?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I felt like it."
