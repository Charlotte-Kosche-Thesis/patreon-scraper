    "summary": "Hi there. My name is A.E. Prevost. I write things, and I would love to spend more time writing things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, even without patron support, I\u0027m working on manuscript revisions of my first novel, a secondary-world fantasy adventure about organized crime and friendship, with teenage protagonists. I am also getting out two or three short stories each year, some of which are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.capricioussf.org/issue-9-gender-diverse-pronouns/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egetting\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://graceandvictory.ca/redwing.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epublished\u003c/a\u003e. On top of that, I\u0027m very proud to be the co-writer and script editor (and director) for \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/thelingspace/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Ling Space\u003c/a\u003e, an extremely neat educational video project teaching Linguistics to a broad audience on YouTube and social media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can imagine, all this great stuff takes a bunch of time! But since I am a human who needs to eat and pay rent and etc., I also have a full-time job. It\u0027s a good job! I\u0027m really lucky! But it\u0027s not writing, and the sad fact is, all of the time I spend not-writing severely increases my local quota of worldsuck. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in. I\u0027m fighting the good fight to eventually turn the thing I love doing the most into a career, but I\u0027m too chicken/sensible to just launch myself into the void. As it happens, right now I actually \u003cem\u003espend \u003c/em\u003emoney to pursue the writing life: among other things, I have a fantastic \u003ca href=\"http://www.ardreediting.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eeditor\u003c/a\u003e who I pay to review all my larger projects, and I attend a couple of professional-development-type conferences every year. So to start with, I\u0027m aiming to see if what you guys send my way will be able to cover those expenses, so that it doesn\u0027t cost me money to write. Lofty goals!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the help of my Patreon patrons, I\u0027m hoping that my writing will allow me to eventually transition away from my day job towards a career as a writer. In the meantime, I\u0027ll love having you guys along for the ride. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me, you\u0027ll get access to my patron-only feed, which will be uploaded monthly with more content opening up at each level of my funding goals. The bundle will consist of whatever I want to share with you that month: short stories and works in progress, surprisingly decent/incredibly bad things I wrote when I was younger, nonfiction essays, poetry, fanfiction, or even the occasional doodle. We\u0027ll have to see together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been informed a WRITING SAMPLE would be good to put on here. You can check out my growing portfolio of works on my \u003ca href=\"http://aeprevost.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e, but in the meantime here is a (very) short story I wrote when a friend mentioned he was reading \"popcorn fiction\", and I didn\u0027t know what that meant:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe trickle of sweat started at her hairline, navigating the creases of her forehead before pearling at the corner of her brow. Samantha wiped it away with a practiced hand, her eyes never leaving the pan in front of her. Timing was crucial, now, the heat sinking into the kernels, breaching the outer husk, reminding the long-dormant moisture trapped within that before being plant life, before being rain, it had been clouds.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo yeah! Turns out \"popcorn fiction\" means \"short, fluffy, easy-to-read fiction\", not \"stories about popcorn\", but hey, writing sample for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo important footnotes about the majority of stories that will be turning up in my monthly Patreon drops! First, most places that publish fiction request \"First Publication\" rights, so anything that I have not yet published (but would like to someday) will have to be in draft form. And second, most of what I write is aimed at audiences 15+, and might include profanity, stabby times, politics, or kissing (or maybe ALL OF THE ABOVE??). Consider yourselves warned!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGOALS - Here\u0027s what we\u0027re going to be working towards! Let\u0027s start with these and see:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriting Doesn\u0027t Cost Me Money - 150$ per month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it is, I spend about 150$ each month on writing, with most of that going to my editor for her work and the rest being the averaged-out cost of writing-related software (Microsoft Office, Scrivener, etc). If we reach this funding goal, writing won\u0027t be supporting me yet, but at least it won\u0027t cost me dollars!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I write about 3 short stories a year; when my Patreon reaches 150$/month, I will double that, sweetening the patron-only feed with one full piece of original fiction every second month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfessional Development - 300$ per month\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of my editing and software costs, if this goal is reached Patreon will also cover my registration and airfare to attend conferences each year that allow me to learn to be a better writer and network with other creators. I\u0027ve been attending VidCon and NerdCon: Stories for the past two years, so those are the most likely going forward, but I\u0027ve also got my eyes open to other literary events (I would love to go to WorldCon again!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen my Patreon reaches 300$/month, I\u0027m going to try something different to thank you guys. I\u0027ve never really written much fanfiction, but the idea sounds super fun, so if this funding goal is reached I will give it a shot and give you a fanfic of some kind every second month on top of what I\u0027m already writing. Let\u0027s go!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s it for now. I\u0027ve got more in store if those goals get reached, so let\u0027s see what we can unlock! Thank you all for reading and for supporting me, and I can\u0027t wait to share my creative projects with you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
