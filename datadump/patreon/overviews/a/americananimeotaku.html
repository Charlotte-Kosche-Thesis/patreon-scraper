    "summary": "Greetings! My name is Justin Karvelot and I run a bi-monthly anime review show in video format similar to those of The Angry Video Game Nerd and The Nostalgia Critic. I decided to join Patreon in an effort to expand my show to larger audiences and even start my own anime related podcast. I started this show as a way to show my passion and love for Japanese culture as well as Japanese animation. I especially enjoy the intricate and detailed stories they provide as opposed to Western animation that is mostly episodic and made pretty much exclusively for children. That is why anime has been such a huge influence on me and so many others that it has reached into a global phenomenon that I hope I will one day be a part of through voice acting for anime in English speaking regions. So please feel free to check out what I have to offer at \u003ca href=\"http://www.americananimeotaku.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.americananimeotaku.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s get one thing perfectly straight, \u003cem\u003eI will never charge money for the content that I make or stop making videos if I don\u0027t get support here.\u003c/em\u003e This is simply a way for those who enjoy watching my reviews to help if they want to. However, with the money I receive from my fellow patreons, I hope to make my show bigger and better and more entertaining for everybody as well as do bigger and better things in my videos as well as in my reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour donations gathered from Patreon.com will be used for the following:\u003cbr\u003eConvention Appearances\u003cbr\u003eUpdated Equipment\u003cbr\u003eProps and Costumes\u003cbr\u003eFilming Permits (when needed)\u003cbr\u003eUpdated Software\u003cbr\u003eMaintenance and Upkeep of the Website"
