    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIT STARTED WITH A GEEK TALK SHOW\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, Scott Murray launched a unique part-story/part geek talk show called Assembly of Geeks. \u00a0Within the first three years of existence, AoG saw its audience increase well beyond expectations. Eventually, new spin-off podcasts were created to engage the audience on specific geek topics. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCOMICS, GAMES, NOSTALGIA AND PEGGY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all started with The Peggy Carter Podcast which covered every episode of Agent Carter and featured Hayley Atwell as a guest in the second season. \u00a0That lead to the launch of Comic Book Noob, a popular podcast that quickly covers the basic information about characters and gives the audience suggestions on where to start reading. \u00a0Next came The Gamer\u0027s Dominion with Genese Davis. \u00a0This program features interviews with gamers, writers, developers and thought leaders in the world of video games. \u00a0In 2016, these shows led to the creation of the Assembly of Geeks Podcast Network.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFOCUSED ON AUDIENCE AND QUALITY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScott is an audience-driven content producer who focuses on quality and creativity. \u00a0He learned how to produce audio content while working at the Dallas/Fort Worth NPR affiliate, and he infuses that knowledge into every podcast. \u00a0Your support helps pay for expenses that go into podcast feed hosting, equipment, production elements and much more."
