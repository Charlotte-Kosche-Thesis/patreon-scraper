    "summary": "For more than\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://artifex-prime.tumblr.com/post/154106781598/four-years\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003efive years\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, I\u0027ve been drawing Nathan Fillion almost every day. \u00a0I admit it\u0027s an obsession, an obsession I channeled into a project to reanimate a buried and suffocated talent. Now the talent is alive again. Now I want to realize ambitions to make art that will be widely seen, and appreciated, and interpreted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo fulfill those ambitions, I \u003cem\u003ecould\u003c/em\u003e have focused on my cat, or the view out the window, or childhood memories, or Elvis, but I was compelled instead to focus on Nathan Fillion, whose roles are deeply sympathetic, and whose attitudes and interests track closely with mine \u2014 and who is as decent a human being as an entertainer can be. He\u0027s fascinating to watch. His expressions convey both strong emotion and subtle nuance; his body is capable of eloquent gesture and dynamic action. He\u0027s a challenge to draw. His face has a suavity that\u0027s hard to capture, but so rewarding when it\u0027s caught. He\u0027s not a superstar. He\u0027s a real man, practicing his craft with integrity and verve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat began as a celebrity crush has become a vital connection to the wide world. Every day in my studio I think about what it means to be me, here in flyover country, spending my attention and affections on a man I\u0027ll never know. What about his roles? About the stories they tell? What do they mean to me and his legion of fans? I limit focus to him to keep from being overwhelmed by questions that surface every day. I might outgrow that limitation someday, or Nathan Fillion, speeding on the superhighway of celebrity, could break the connection with a discouraging word. But until that day, if it ever arrives, I\u0027ll pretend I\u0027ve enlisted him in my project.\u00a0If my work survives, in whatever small way, I hope it reflects positively not only on me, but also on him.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn that project, like a film director, I\u0027ve placed Nathan Fillion\u0027s image at center stage; I\u0027ve cast him as\u00a0a protagonist, a champion, a symbol, and a surrogate. But also, like a director, I\u0027ve brought my personal history, vision, knowledge, and imagination to this project. Slowly, it is becoming more encompassing, as concerns about space and time and perception from my long ago art school education come back into play. Added to that now are thoughts about narrative, about mediated experience, about the deceptions and perceptions of actors and acting. I want to work through these issues to make objects of lasting value that show what it\u0027s like to be alive here and now, seeing the world through the filter of popular media, amidst the upheaval of these times.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m undertaking this Patreon because it\u0027s become clear to me that making ambitious work takes resources beyond good intentions and a pile of sketchbooks. I need to conduct myself as an artist, that is: to invite criticism and discussion of my work; to make work worthy of exhibition, and to seek out opportunities to show it;\u00a0to give consideration to the presentation and preservation of it; and to develop a consciousness of myself as a professional. I don\u0027t have a lot of time. I need help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides the very real value of your monetary contribution, which I\u0027ll spend on studio supplies, your thoughts and reactions and technical support are particularly welcome. I post photos almost every day and write about what I\u0027m thinking. It\u0027s like welcoming visitors to the studio with a cup of coffee and talking their ears off, then putting them to work. Like a film, this project is collaborative. Stop by any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
