    "summary": "I love history.  To me, history is more than just boldface names and famous dates.  History is people and personalities, triumphs and tragedies, thoughts and actions, beginnings and ends.  People sometimes wonder what history has to do with what happens today.  It has everything to do with today.  Everything is history, and I study the Presidents and the Presidency every single day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI study the individuals and their lives \u2014 who they were, what they were like, how they looked, and where they came from.  I also study the institution of the Presidency \u2014 its powers and limitations, its evolution and role in shaping the United States and the world beyond.\u003cbr\u003eWhat it comes down to for me every time, though, is people.  I am captivated by the people who held the office, how they responded to challenges and what the legacy was that they left behind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Presidency, to me, is the most unique position in the world.  The President is, simultaneously, the most admired and most reviled person in the country.  The President is, by default, the most trusted person in the country.  The President is, without fail, the most judged person in the country.  Everything they do influences us; everything we do is influenced by them.  The most amazing thing about it is that we have the opportunity to choose that person.  We might not always like or agree with the person we get, but that\u2019s our President \u2014 he belongs to all of us.  That\u2019s what fascinates me about his office and his position. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s why I write about the Presidents. To everyone who supports me, thank you. I appreciate every comment and question I get, and hope to continue to engage with you all in the years to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
