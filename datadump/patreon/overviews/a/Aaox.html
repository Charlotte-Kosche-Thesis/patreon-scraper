    "summary": "Hello there! My name\u0027s Benjamin Holdsworth, although typically on the internet I go by Aaox. I feel like perhaps my rather obtuse choice of nomenclature might be half the reason why I don\u0027t get a lot of traffic, but this is the hole I dug for myself, I suppose.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI presume, if you\u0027re here - which I\u0027m \u003cem\u003ealmost certain\u003c/em\u003e you are - you came here from my YouTube channel wherein I review Anime and Video Games. Hopefully you enjoyed what you saw there and have come here with intent to offer me monetary compensation out of the kindness of your heart, and that\u0027s - well, that\u0027s unbelievable, quite frankly, but that\u0027s what this service is for, so I suppose we\u0027ll roll with it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like anime and video games a lot! I have done for decade(s) now, and I also happen to really enjoy breaking things down critically and looking at why precisely I either did or did not care for them. To my surprise, it appears some people enjoy hearing my opinions on television programs and computer games, and so a perfect scenario was presented to me. With one small catch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos are quite time consuming to make! It\u0027s also a lot of work for one person, and oftentimes the volume of work precludes getting them out effectively, especially when trying to keep them relevant. With your (yes, your!) beloved dollars behind me, I can get them out far more quickly, reliably and effectively. I\u0027ll also be able to afford to, uh - to eat food.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt goes without saying that \u003cstrong\u003enone of these videos will be Backer exclusive\u003c/strong\u003e, and I\u0027m certainly not going to charge a service charge for talking to me, although depending on whether or not I\u0027m flooded (high hopes low expectations) with messages I may or may not be able to respond. I\u0027m also completely open to the idea of charging per video rather than monthly, depending on whatever works best for the majority of those who support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will enable me to continue doing something I love to do, and that\u0027s incredible. You\u0027re incredible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eIncredible.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t thank you enough for your time, but suffice it to say, I adore you.\u003cbr\u003e- Aaox\u003cbr\u003e"
