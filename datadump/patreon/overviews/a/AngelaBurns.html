I\u0027m hoping to connect with you through this platform on deeper and more frequent level, and I want to encourage you through my music and prayer life. \u00a0Patreon is a platform where artists can receive financial support from those who believe in their art.

Just as soon as I write it...you will receive it! There is space for you also to connect back with me on your thoughts and insights, so we can get to know each other better:) \u00a0If you would like to partner with me, click the \"\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\" button and let\u0027s start making music together! \u00a0I would be so incredibly grateful for your support. \u00a0And I hope to be a steady encouragement to you in the days to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(15, 36, 62);\"\u003eThat about sums it up!

I enjoy the \u003cstrong\u003eprocess of crafting a song from start to finish\u003c/strong\u003e... laboring over lyrics and chord progressions, writing and rewriting, and then taking it into the studio for yet another transformation. The process is a lot of work but super fun! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a sample of one of my songs off my most recent album:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9UweI_mf3Cs\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE RAW SOUND OF WORSHIP\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHowever, I also find something incredibly beautiful about the raw sound of worship. \u00a0Songs from the heart in the moment. \u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Songs that bubble up while meditating on the word of God. These are typically songs that have simpler chord progressions with a variety of melodies and phrases sung with abandon. They could also be songs with a bit less structure, where I am singing through actual scripture. \u00a0Or they may be just a song poured out from my heart in the moment. \u00a0But in each case,\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e \u003cstrong\u003ethey will typically be written in one sitting.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u00a0Not overworked or overthought. \u00a0This is to keep the \u003cstrong\u003eauthenticity and the freshness\u003c/strong\u003e of the moment alive to then share these moments with you. (As we move along, I may play around with adding embellishments and other instrumentation, but the original recording will usually be done during one worship session.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTo hear examples\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0of the kind of songs I\u0027m talking about see my recent\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eposts, \u003c/strong\u003e\"Psalm 24\" or\u00a0\"Who do you say I am\".
