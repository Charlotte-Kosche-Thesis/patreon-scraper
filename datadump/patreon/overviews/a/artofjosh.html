    "summary": "WHAT I DO\u003cbr\u003eI love to create artwork in a variety of mediums, including: monotype printmaking using acrylic paints on gel plates, watercolor painting and Indian ink drawing. My style is all about embracing bold colors, highlights, shadows, and perfect imperfections. It is my opinion that every piece in a series should have its own character and differences between each print is part of what makes the art so enjoyable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHY I DO IT\u003cbr\u003eI believe that self-expression is self-love. The process of making art is therapeutic and makes me happy. Words that I use to describe my pieces include sexy confidence, joyful empowerment, alluring connection, beauty and mystery. I want to embrace these words and the feelings that go along with them and I think you should to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWHAT I AM WORKING ON NOW\u003cbr\u003eI am working on a series of drawings and prints that highlight women of popular myths, celebrating them, and thinking about how their stories might have been different if we were not so afraid of female strength, intelligence, and power. In this endeavor I\u2019ve been thinking about how some of the narratives might be changed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHOW YOU CAN SUPPORT ME\u003cbr\u003eIf any of this inspires you, I\u0027d love to have you follow along in my printmaking endeavor. As a patron of my art, you subscribe to support my work on a regular basis. Your support and encouragement keep me going, and as a \"thank you\", you will get digital images of my art creations.
