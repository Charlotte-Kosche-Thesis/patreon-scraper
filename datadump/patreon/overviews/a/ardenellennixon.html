It is my sincerest wish for my paintings to find the\nbeauty in the dark--as with my extensive \"Make-Shift Angel\" series--the\nsilly in the sublime, and the humanity shared by the creatures and world\naround us.  This would be my quest even if my paintings went unseen.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks to the dubious wonder of the internet, my paintings \u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e seen,\nand I want continue creating more to share with you. By becoming a patron,\nyou would help offset supply and show costs so that I can bring my art to\nan even larger audience and dedicate more time to my craft.  I want to improve for you as much as myself, and I know that not everyone has the space or budget for prints and originals. \nIndeed, I ran out of room for my favorites long ago!\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t expect or assume anyone will contribute more than their feelings for my paintings, which is a gift unto itself.  If you want to give more, I\nam humbled, as I always am when someone supports my art.  Having worked my\nshare of customer service jobs, I know well how hard-earned very little\nmoney can be.  I\u0027ve purposefully kept my pledge tiers low so that no one\nputs themselves out for my sake, and I sincerely ask that you take care of\nyou first before thinking of me.  My paintings and I will still be at http://ardenellennixon.com/ regardless.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting my art, be it via donation, recommendation, or\nsimply your shared thoughts.  I paint for you as much as myself, and I am\ngrateful for that connection.\u00a0"
