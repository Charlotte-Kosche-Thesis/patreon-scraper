    "summary": "\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWhat is the Otherfaith?\u003c/h2\u003e\nThe\u00a0\n\u003ca href=\"http://daoineile.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eOtherfaith\u003c/a\u003e is a modern polytheist religion founded in 2010 by a group of young polytheists. I (Aine Llewellyn) desired a less ancient-focused religious tradition, getting away from Wicca and reconstructionism. This lead me to founding the Otherfaith.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOur religion worships \n\u003cem\u003enew gods\u003c/em\u003e, ones not attested to in folklore or history. The process of knowing these gods is a communal one in the current Otherfaith community. We also worship a host of spirits (whom we call \u0027\u003cem\u003efairies\u003c/em\u003e\u0027). We revere our gods and spirits through prayer, story, and otherworldly exploration. Our view of the spirit world is influenced by animism and a firm belief in the agency of spirits.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Otherfaith is unique in its approach to gods and spirits and practice, though we owe much to those who have also written about new gods and laid the groundwork for us to jump from. Ideally, the faith will always be polytheist but always push the boundaries, expectations, and assumptions that come with the the labels of \u0027polytheist\u0027 and \u0027religion\u0027.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSupporting the Otherfaith\u003c/h3\u003e\nAs the founder of a new religious tradition, I\u0027ve found myself with a \n\u003cem\u003elot \u003c/em\u003eof work to do. \u00a0There are the very simple introductory posts as well as those that explore the more progressive ideas stemming from this modern faith.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Otherfaith doesn\u0027t fit a recognizable model in any of its original homes. Coming from the Pagan, witchcraft, and polytheist movements, it has morphed into its own being not yet established enough to fit into easily published books or genres. Our blend of polytheism, modern life, scifi/fantasy, and fandom creates a heady blend that needs to be worked out gently, without casting assumptions on where we belong. Beyond simply not fitting in existing spaces, it is better for the faith and its content to remain freer and able to grow as it will.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Otherfaith has been in existence for five years. We don\u0027t proselytize but inform through education and story. It\u0027s vital that the faith continues to have content put out into the world, both online and off, in order to help its exposure and to develop a stronger, more diverse group.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhat You Are Funding\u003c/h3\u003e\nWhat exactly are you funding by becoming a patron? My ability to keep writing - and living expenses! Though I currently live with a supportive partner, the ability to support myself and contribute to the household is important.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBecoming a patron also helps me see who is interested in my work, and as I develop this Patreon, patrons can help direct where my writing goes. Funding will help me develop more materials by taking away stress and allowing me to dedicate more of my time to writing about the Otherfaith. And it will help me buy materials for projects such as prayer cards, and with enough funding we can eventually commission artists, sculptors, and other creators to make beautiful content for the Otherfaith in ways I can\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, apart from writing, my next goal is to start a podcast about the Otherfaith, eventually interviewing members of the religion and others involved in creating new religions and spiritual paths.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eCreated Content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eBlogging\u003c/h3\u003e\nFor years, I have reached others through blogging. This is the main content I produce and would be most of what patrons are supporting. Patrons would be supporting my Otherfaith-specific blogging - those posts that cover basic information on gods and spirits, introductory practices, prayers and devotions, holy days and ceremonies, as well as ethics and morality. Posts go up weekly.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003ePodcasts\u003c/h3\u003e\nThis year I would like to begin a podcast that covers Otherfaith topics. It will begin with re-hashing introductory ideas, history of the Otherfaith and how we have changed, and move on to storytelling, interviews, and new ideas about our gods and spirits. I am thrilled to begin work on this as an alternative and addition to our current text-heavy content.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBooks\u003c/h3\u003e\nIn modern Paganism, books have helped with introducing newcomers to religions and traditions immensely. By writing and publishing books, we will be able to condense and codify information on the Otherfaith. I currently have an introduction to the Otherfaith book in the works, and specific books tied to the holy days are being considered. Putting out solid, physical content is a huge step that will help the Otherfaith solidify into a firm religious tradition.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eRewards\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCurrent Rewards\u003c/h3\u003e\nI am currently focusing on giving out Tarot readings - a skill I trained myself in and enjoy. Tiers range from one-card readings to medium-sized readings from the current Tarot deck I use. The highest tier of rewards includes prayer cards to be sent out each month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFuture Rewards\u003c/h3\u003e\nAs I build more content for the Otherfaith and we have a solid base, I plan to expand on the rewards for patrons. I look forward to being able to provide patron-specific content and allow patrons an early look into new content for the faith. I would like to also provide how-to\u0027s for patrons on the topic of developing and sustaining new religious practices."

Since I founded this tradition at 17, most of my life has been devoted to it. Promoting this new religious tradition through mythic storytelling and social media shows my roots as a Millennial. I hope to bring the Otherfaith into the minds of a variety of people and change the way we think about religion and its role in our modern lives. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a background in creative writing - in that I love to read and have written since I was young. Poetry and prayer are far from my strong suit, and I prefer to focus on educational and story posts. The Otherfaith is now five years old, meaning there is a lot of content to get out into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI seek to inform, not to convert, and I believe my ideas about religion - influenced by fiction, fandom, and urban life - can bring a fresh\u00a0perspective to our communities.",
