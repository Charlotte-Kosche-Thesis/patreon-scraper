    "summary": "Hello, world! My name is Austen Hartke, and I\u2019m a writer,\nvideo creator, and educator, here to make things a little better for people\nliving at the intersection of faith and gender identity. What the heck does\nthat mean, you may ask? Well, here\u2019s the scoop--I\u2019ve spent the last couple of\nyears creating videos on theological issues related to trans identities over on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwWfCs7vnwdC1wbIAmH3_kIm0fE7oN9tE\"\u003emy YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0And, of course, I do in-person education sessions with\nchurches, small groups, community centers, and LGBTQ related conferences. Most\nrecently, I\u2019ve written a book called \u003cstrong\u003e\u201cTransforming: The Bible and the Lives of\nTransgender Christians\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e which is published through Westminster John Knox Press, and available on\u00a0on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Transforming-Bible-Lives-Transgender-Christians/dp/0664263100/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1504715737\u0026amp;sr=8-1\u0026amp;keywords=austen+hartke\"\u003eAmazon\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/transforming-austen-hartke/1127092617?ean=9780664263102#/\"\u003eBarnes and Noble\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.powells.com/book/-9780664263102\"\u003ePowells\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.booksamillion.com/p/Transforming/Austen-Hartke/9780664263102?id=7233310604836\"\u003eBooks-A-Million\u003c/a\u003e, and at your local independent bookstore!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut the more I do, the more I find TO do.\nThere\u2019s a huge need for resources for people that are transgender and also\nChristian. I get emails every day from trans folks of all ages who are looking\nfor books that talk about gender identity in theology, or Bibles with inclusive\nlanguage, or discussion guides on LGBTQ identities for their youth group, and\non and on! And I need your help to answer all these questions, and to make\nresources like this come to life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m working with Patreon. Patreon is\na way to support creators you love with a monthly donation. Think of it like\npublic radio, or TV! It\u2019s because of donations from viewers like you that\ncreators like me can afford to keep making the things you love! By supporting\nme here, you\u2019re supporting the creation of the Transgender and Christian\nvideos, getting those videos Closed Captioned for our Deaf and hard of hearing\nfriends, helping pay for the time it takes to create new written and visual\nresources, and the expenses inherent in traveling and speaking to churches that\nwant to learn more about how to become trans-inclusive communities. Your\ndonations are literally helping to make the world a better plans for trans and\ngender-non-conforming people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd if that\u2019s not enough to convince you to sign\non, you also get some pretty cool perks. At the $1 level you get a shout out in\nthat month\u2019s Trans \u0026amp; Christian video. At the $5 level you\u2019ll get the community perk--my personal favorite--where you\u0027ll have access to a patrons-only Discord server where we can interact and share our stories! There are so many other awesome perks, so take a look and find the one that\u0027s right for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019re able, please consider donating to\nmy work by clicking the Become a Patron button on my Patreon page. This work\ncan\u2019t happen without you, and I am incredibly grateful for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPeace, friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n-------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo let\u0027s do a little Q\u0026amp;A...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ) Where can I find your videos? And where can I contact you about coming to my school/church/community center/etc?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA) All my videos are posted to my YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/AustenLionheart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/AustenLionheart\u003c/a\u003e. For more info on the resources I\u0027m creating, and the work that I\u0027m doing, by checking out my website--\u003ca href=\"http://www.austenhartke.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.austenhartke.com\u003c/a\u003e. And if you want to contact me about speaking, feel free to drop me a line at info@austenhartke.com!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ) If I become a patron, how often will I be charged?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA) You\u0027ll be charged once per month, at whatever rate you select, and you can cancel your patronage at any time--no contracts here! You can learn more at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/categories/200359925-Patrons\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatreon\u0027s FAQ page\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ) Can I do a one-time donation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA) So far Patreon doesn\u0027t have a one-time donation option, but they do suggest, if you\u0027d like to do this, that you sign up as a patron for whatever amount you\u0027d like to give, and then cancel your patronage after that first amount has been paid.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, everyone!"
