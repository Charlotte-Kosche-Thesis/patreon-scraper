His sound borrows from the vast vernacular of folk, indie-pop and Americana in order to create a truly compelling and personal narrative in the vein of visionary artists the likes of Tom Waits, Bright Eyes, and Johnny Cash.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHis new album, \"Kyle Adem is Dead\" is the debut release under his new moniker released 8 April 2016. This self-referential collection of emotional songs was recorded in four hours at The Ghost Motel in Knoxville, TN under direction of Dylen Terflinger. Thematically broad and sonically dynamic, Adeem has crafted a breathtakingly honest piece of music that is both incendiary and inspiring.\u003cbr\u003e",
