    "summary": "[ www.rehoned.com is replaced with www.rehoned.me ]\u003cbr\u003eHi folks, my name is Ash Young and I created rehoned.me to give everyone a new point of view about our world. The truth is that we are the problem and even if we like it or not, we need to get smarter, kinder, and sneakier, and trick ourselves into being happy.\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, I\u0027ve learned the real secret of being happy, doing the job I like and inspiring people who want to create their own unique and ready to be envied life. Also, I\u0027ve learned the secret of sleeping like a baby, without a care in the world.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to make rehoned.me so big that people all around the world will start to feel that someone understands them completely. We all needed a bit of guidance once in a while.\u003cbr\u003eI am being frank with you, dear friend. Aren\u0027t you tired of this sick world? Are you ready to be part of an original transformation of this world? Are you ready to take the responsibility of this big change on your shoulders and march with me?\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the first month of 2017 and this is what I want you to see soon on rehoned.me:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigh-quality videos where I explain the reasons we are unhappy and the solutions we have, and much much more\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHigh-quality articles in addition to the videos I upload, where I give some details from my daily life as example; these all besides the other articles I post on site.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy first book which will explain clearly how\u00a0to get\u00a0through a long period of depression. It will include tricks I used to survive, and things I learned about life. There is a secret and I want to share it with you, not like others who talk vaguely about their secrets.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eFor all of those I need:\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eNew fancy video equipment (I heard that only \"fancy\" makes the videos fancy).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eOngoing web development. As a website, it needs love and attention, and the occasional designer makeover, because we like to stay fresh and interesting(and there is a team behind this site. This amazing team do almost everything you see new on site, but writing is my call of duty. They deserve a little bit of happiness too because they are as broke as we are.)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn editor I have to pay monthly for this hard work. English isn\u0027t my first language, so yep, I need one like I need air. This lucky employee will have to endure my annoying questions all day long (just kidding, I won\u0027t be that annoying).\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eTo pay monthly fees for hosting. Yes, everything costs, I got the message that nothing is free a long time ago, even ifit should be.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eSome minimal necessities for myself so I can focus on rehoned.me full time, like food and clothes. Despite the fact that I was born a tomboy,  I am a girl, and I still need to be pretty!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003eI don\u0027t like wasting money and if there is any left over from the monthly goal, it will go with me to a store so I can buy goods, and those will be sent directly to the foster homes in my town or others nearby. I love children and I feel their pain over and over again. Their pain reminds me of my unlucky childhood and I would do anything to see children smiling. They have no fault, exactly like those of us less unfortunate had either.\u003cbr\u003eMy future plan starting with this spring includes videos about travelling with less money and still seeing the world, but that will be then. We will work up to that point, and then see what is going on.\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thanks a lot for your support! I like to think of every human being on this planet as a close friend who can help me and who can let me help them because we are brothers and sisters, if we search for our origins. This big change of our world starts with us and from within us."
