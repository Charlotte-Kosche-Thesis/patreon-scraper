I\u0027m Garth Haslam, and I\u0027ve been posting my research on accounts of strange, weird, and paranormal events since 1996 on my websites \u003cstrong\u003eAnomalies: the Strange \u0026amp; Unexplained\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://anomalyinfo.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.AnomalyInfo.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e) and \u003cstrong\u003eMonsters Here \u0026amp; There\u003c/strong\u003e (\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://monstersherethere.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.MonstersHereThere.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e). In \u003cem\u003eAnomalies\u003c/em\u003e, I track accounts of the strange to their earliest sources to find what actually happened and didn\u0027t; I try to not be too skeptical or believing, letting the facts I find speak for themselves so readers can reach their own conclusions. In \u003cem\u003eMonsters Here \u0026amp; There\u003c/em\u003e I profile weird and incredible creatures from around the world, trying to present the most precise idea of what people have spoken of -- fictional or real -- and why these strange beings are important to people everywhere. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI add a new full article to \u003cem\u003eAnomalies\u003c/em\u003e once a week, and try to add a new monster or topic to \u003cem\u003eMonsters H\u0026amp;T\u003c/em\u003e about once a month. I want to work on both sites more often, but I have limited time between two jobs! As a Patron, you\u0027ll get access to new articles at least a week before the rest of the world, free downloads of my existing and future Anomalies eBooks, and a Patreon exclusive series of essays about the study of strange stuff entitled \u003cem\u003eParanormal Points\u003c/em\u003e.. and, of course, you\u0027ll be helping me towards my goal of losing the second job so I can use that time to focus on strange stories and monsters more!\u003cbr\u003e"
