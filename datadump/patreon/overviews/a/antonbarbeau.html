    "summary": "Won\u0027t you join me on this EPIC JOURNEY??? Huh. Well, hi. Ant here. Sorry - I cringe at the lingo du jour. I\u0027ve never thought of my life in rock as a journey, certainly not an epic one. I mean, I have epic aspirations, certainly, but I\u0027d never take lay that trip on you guys without at least a heavy dose of guilt and irony! \u00a0Natural Causes has been delivered and I\u0027m well into the next records, in the messy, always-recording way that I work. There\u0027s the alleged third part of the alleged trilogy that so far consists of Magic Act and Natural Causes. Part 3 is now titled Berliner Grotesk and it contains a blob of stompy piano waltzes and rejects from the Disaster on Sandwich Island musical. Pretty much what you\u0027d expect, no? There\u0027s also the amusing Kenny vs Giacomo y Carolina album in the works. Most certainly, without my input or awareness, Antronica 3 is willing itself into being. I think my synth-pop records make themselves while I\u0027m asleep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is to say that there\u0027s always more Antmusik in the works. I\u0027ve done 6 (???!!!) crowd funding campaigns, and they\u0027ve all made it, by the seat of someone\u0027s pants in some cases. But I can tell you, whatever Chipper Grin might sit above my chin, the whole Kickstarter thing is not something I ever feel much good about. It takes a deep toll on my soul and I worry that it\u0027s a drain on the enthusiasm of my fans and friends. That\u0027s why I\u0027m looking to try out this PLATFORM for a change. I seem to have a small gang of supporters who come through every time, and new peeps who chime in with support if only out of curiosity! Instead of the bulldozer rampage that crowd funding feels like, I\u0027d like to treat OUR world of Patreon like it\u0027s a tricycle in a shopping mall on Sunday. I\u0027ll try out new songs \"live in (online) concert,\" but only for YOU. I\u0027ll test the new-song waters in YOUR bathtub. Demos of non-greatest hits? Alternate mixes and dubs? Ting? All YOURS. Cover songs? You want them Bowie tunes? Them Beatles (Sorry, Joe...)? Maybe Patreon is where, but again, only for YOU. You get it. All the fun of getting paid to send out FREE stuff \u00a0and and none of the coal mining agony of the Artist Unqualified To Mime.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn simpler terms, your support helps me release albums, make videos, fix gear, tour, and afford sandwiches, and in return, you get exclusive access to brand-new songs and a peek behind the scenes at how it all happens. Music has been my \"job\" forever, and I\u0027m trying to find new ways of keeping things rolling forward. \"Tap into the...\" You Know! And, gracias!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many things will you release a month?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTwo or three, to start, probably. You\u0027ll only be billed once a month, though, for the set amount that you choose, not every time I release something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of \"things,\" anyway?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDemos of new songs, dubs and alternate mixes, videos, covers (by request/suggestion?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan I stop donating if I want to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, yes! But we hope you\u0027ll stick around. That being said, it\u0027s easy to to cancel any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US dollars? Do I have to pledge the set amounts?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site shows American Numbers, but you can pledge from wherever you are, and it will automatically be converted. If you\u0027d like to customiSe your amount, you can write in whatever you like at checkout.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWill Anton be doing any more dancing videos in the future?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Concentrate and ask again.\" For now, absolutely free of charge...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dkRcMPcE-Kg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
