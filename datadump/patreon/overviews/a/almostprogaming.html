I specialize in creating Competitive Guides for Warhammer 40k, but I also do competitive Battle Reports. I am making this Patreon because I love what I do but it takes a lot of time and money to make the videos my fans want me to make. I would like some help so I can put money towards codex\u0027s and other things I need in order to make efficient and accurate guides. Also if this goes well enough, I\u0027m hoping I can turn this into a full-time job so I can make more content for you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-I have guides for everyone; new players, veterans, and die hard competitive players.\u003cbr\u003e- I make videos talking about each individual army and what makes them good or bad in competitive play.\u003cbr\u003e- I make competitive battle reports and while playing I go over why I am doing certain things and which strategies I am using in order to win the game.\u003cbr\u003e-I cover major tournaments and break down the top armies from each event.\u003cbr\u003e-Every month I come out with an updated top 10 armies of the game.\u003cbr\u003e-I talk about new armies/units as they come out, and always try to be on top of the meta so that you can be on top of the meta.\u003cbr\u003e"
