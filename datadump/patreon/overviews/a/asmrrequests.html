I\u0027m Ally of ASMRRequests, a YouTube channel dedicated to tingles, relaxation, and zzz\u0027s.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatreon is an awesome way to help support the artists whose work you enjoy. It\u0027s a new funding platform that is similar in many ways to Kickstarter or IndieGoGo, with one major difference: instead of giving one large donation towards a big project, with Patreon you can give regular support to the artists you love who are creating content on an ongoing basis! I\u0027m super excited to be a part of such a cool idea!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s your deal?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI enjoy creating ASMR videos on YouTube (if you are unfamiliar with ASMR, I have provided links at the bottom of this page which you can click to learn more). I have built my channel over the last year or so, and I\u0027ve never known such profound happiness or creative fulfillment. I like my ASMR videos to function as more than just tingle-inducers, so I really enjoy finding ways of creating videos which not only relax my viewers, but also inform, engage, and entertain them. I am the creator the ASMR Sci-Fi series, Departure, which is set in the future and driven by an adventure storyline. I love the series, and I can\u0027t wait to continue it! You can see Episode 1 below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/oapgiZc5i-g\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I benefit from becoming your Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like my work, and want to see more of it more often, then you\u0027ll benefit from becoming a Patron.
