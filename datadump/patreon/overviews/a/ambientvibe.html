Most of my work consists of fantasy and sci-fi character concepts, but I also dabble in action scenes, object or prop studies and backgrounds. I have no formal art training but I did teach Middle school and High school art classes when I worked as a teacher in northern \u003cem\u003eAlberta, Canada\u003c/em\u003e. My university studies did span \u0027school art\u0027 instruction, but never anything that could be considered *serious* college-level art. Still, it turned out that my desire to go beyond what I taught was stronger than I thought - and awakened in me the passion to explore avenues never before considered.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eIt started with creating simple web graphics - templates, banners, buttons, overlays - what have you - and moved to creating fan sites for different game communities. It was there that people first asked me if I could draw characters and introduced me to the intriguing world of 3-D render art (Poser, DAZ Studio). Before I knew \u00a0it, I was downloading DAZ and with the first ever simple render of a spectacular, life-like human figure - I was hooked. Since then, I have moved onto learning Smith Micro\u0027s Poser and delving far deeper into Photoshop editing techniques than ever before. Currently, I am working on proving to myself that it is never too late to discover new things and that the journey to achieving such things is far more exciting than the destination!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eAbove all, I am a staunch believer of the \"Live. Love. Laugh.\" motto - whatever you do out there, whether it is in your career, social life or hobby - do not lose sight of the 3 most important things in life - they will ensure that no matter what you encounter on your travels, you will always meet it head on, with a smile and your best foot forward.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eAbout My Patreon\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eWhy am I here? Well, it is all about navigating the vast ocean of life on a journey to ultimate self-discovery and better self-awareness. I believe Frank Herbert said it best:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cA person needs new experiences. They jar something deep inside, allowing you to grow. Without them, it sleeps- seldom to awaken. The sleeper must awaken. \u201d \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also looking to cultivate and build relationships with fellow artists and followers of my work, since I lack the opportunity to meet either of them in person.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eIn a Nutshell\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eShould you decide to become my supporter on Patreon, you will gain access to my Patreon feed for a monthly donation of your choice. You can set a monthly max amount and are free to cancel at any time - as long as you have made at least one monthly payment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you are supporting me (the artist) not only in a material but also in an emotional way, making it possible for me to have the comfort, freedom and inspiration to create more art and improve currently used equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Patreon feed will include exclusive and non-exclusive art, works in progress (which are never shared with anyone else save the client commissioning the work), high resolution (PSD) files and occasional podcasts or video tutorials. I look forward to hearing your suggestions, taking requests, posing questions, or polling your opinions on future projects. Some of my work does include NSFW art, so if there is any interest in that, I shall be including it here, also.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this time, I will be testing the waters to see what works for you all, and adjusting the pledge/reward system accordingly.
