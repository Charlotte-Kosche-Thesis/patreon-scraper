    "summary": "Hello everyone, \u00a0my name is Anthony Bannach and I am a young composer who wants to become a full-time composer! \u00a0I do work in multiple areas: \u00a0original compositions for concert music or for games/tv/film, arrangements, recordings, etc. In the age of the internet, creativity is at an all time high, yet unfortunately, for many young or undiscovered creators, the ability to make a living off of that is very difficult. \u00a0I\u0027m making this patreon page, because in a time when everything is constantly changing, where everything is being simplified or tweaked for continually shortening-attention spans, I believe it is imperative that we make art, in my case music, that demands real intellectual, artistic, and spiritual focus. \u00a0With your help, we can begin a new trend of success for music besides what\u0027s just on the Top 40 radio. \u00a0I understand, as a person with virtually no cash as well, that money is tight. If you can\u0027t contribute I understand, but if you still want to support me I\u0027d appreciate it immensely if you could share my works, social media updates, etc. \u00a0If you decide to support me, even the most basic amount helps- and trust me I don\u0027t expect many people (or maybe any people) to donate that much money, let alone on a monthy basis. \u00a0HOWEVER, If you do donate a larger amount per month, of course I\u0027ll be very grateful, and the rewards will be more substantial (aka I WILL COMPOSE MUSIC) and personalized (aka FOR YOU)! \u00a0So from the bottom of my heart, thank you- and keep on keepin\u0027 on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTony"
