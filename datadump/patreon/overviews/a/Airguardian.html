My focus is on radio-controlled electric jets performing scale aerobatic flights and trying to replicate the extreme maneuvers performed by the real ones, especially those maneuvers performed by modern russian aircraft in airshows but you can expect any form of airshow coverage from my channel as well as other types of remote controlled flying stuff such as drones, aerobatic planes, extreme 3D helicopter flying and many others... we could say that the common denominator for my content is extreme aerobatics and love for aviation in general. :)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy do I make these videos?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\tI mostly make these videos for fun, in my free time. It is my prefered way of art as it allows me to merge several artistic aspects that I love into a single product, that is, to try to provoke an emotional response in my viewers through the use of visual and audio content, and at the same time, it is the art that I am able to distribute to a broader audience. Say, for example, I am also a miniature painter but not much people actually ever gets to see what I paint...\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tAs long as it has mostly been done for my personal satisfaction, truth is that getting to record and edit so much material is a ton of work (as well as costly) and I would dearly appreciate to get some reward for it, hence, here we are, you and I. If you dearly enjoy what I produce, I would encourage you to contribute to the cause by becoming a patron. \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBecause you know, doing all this for free is already cool but let\u0027s face it, if I could get some bucks out of it, it would be that much more cooler than just \u0027working for free\u0027... \u00a0:)\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat will I do with your money?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\tFirst of all, your money would help me face the maintenance costs of keeping my fleet of RC aircraft in working condition, then, if I made enough earnings out of Patreon, it could also be used to improve and upgrade my filming equipment so as to be able to produce and deliver content of better quality. In addition, I have a few other things in mind that you will find out if you go take a look at my goals and rewards... most important point being that if you want me to fly and make videos of a very particular jet model, I will be doing it cheerfully if you provide the funds for it :)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI won\u0027t stop doing videos even if I get no money out of it, because I enjoy the process and the outcome but let\u0027s face it, it would be so much more rewarding and I could do so much more things if I got some help from you or if this could actually contribute to make a living out of it altogether... so... so feel free to donate if you like what I do :) \n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhat about the publishing schedule?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\tI don\u0027t follow any particular publishing schedule but overall I typically submit a video once a week. As soon as I get any new video done, it goes live.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tAs for my airsoft channel, it is secondary, especially since a single video takes about two to three days of work to produce, so I get to publish very few of those... Still, I think it is an amazing, beautiful and great sport that challenges body and mind alike, and I love to share my shooting adventures with the world. :)\u00a0\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy would you even care to support me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eI am not obliging anyone, that for sure, and I don\u0027t plan on developing exclusive content for patrons either so why would you?\u003cbr\u003e\n\tWell, if you really like what I do, it would be an amazing way to thank me for my work and it would also help to make all this YouTube thing a little bit more sustainable. Running a channel like mine takes money. Just consider the filming gear, the computers required to edit the videos, the HDD needed to store the ludicrous amount of data, the R/C models themselves and all that is required to keep them flying, the batteries having a limited life-span, etc. Yeah, you guessed right, money keeps the wheel turning. If you provide some, I\u0027ll be thankful for it, and if enough money is provided, I will be able to do even more amazing stuff in my videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIn essence, if you really enjoy my content a fraction of what I do, please consider supporting me. :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t(In big bold capital letters)\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tPS: If you have read this far (why would you?), you should seriously consider contributing!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
