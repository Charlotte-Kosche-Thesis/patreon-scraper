I\u0027m Allohmon, and I\u0027m a linguist, a writer, and an educator. I started making YouTube videos during a particularly hectic time (full-time job plus two part-time freelance jobs) because I realized I wasn\u0027t giving myself any time for hobbies, and that\u0027s not healthy. I\u0027ve always had a penchant for playing cerebral computer games and for talking to myself, so why not combine the two? I\u0027m also something of an educational technologist, and games like EU4 and Kerbal Space Program provide ample opportunity for teaching and for learning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247,150,70);\"\u003eWhy support me?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\nFirst off, I do OK; I pay rent and have food on the table. But I\u0027m the primary earner in my household, and linguists don\u0027t exactly make gobs of cash! (Unless they\u0027re tenured professors at fancy universities, that is, but I\u0027m lucky enough just to have my unstable \"visiting\" position at a state school, my multiple cobbled-together freelance jobs, and my professional blog.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have this fantasy that if this channel takes off, I\u0027ll be able to afford to quit my freelance work and survive on just my full-time job and YouTube. Or that if university enrollment or funding drops and I \u003cem\u003elose\u003c/em\u003e my full-time job, YouTube will help cushion the blow. Boy, this got morbid fast-but it\u0027s rough out there. If I can have some fun playing good games while also worrying a little less about providing for my family, that would be pretty awesome."
