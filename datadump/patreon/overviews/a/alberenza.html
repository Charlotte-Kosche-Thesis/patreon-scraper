    "summary": "I\u0027m Alberenza, and it\u0027s always been an ambition of mine to become an Author. I\u0027m heavily inspired by nerdy (then again who isn\u0027t these days) and otaku media, and I\u0027m always looking to provide the best writing I can whilst constantly trying to improve my skills alongside everyone else. I\u0027m still young, and the path before me will inevitably be long and difficult, but I hope I can bring some value into your lives with the fiction I create. With your support, this is something I hope to dedicate my full time to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is the web novel Anima, currently hosted on the website Royal Roads Legends. However, I also have a blog and a youtube channel where I occasionally upload critical analysis and opinion pieces when the mood strikes me. The work on my blog dates a few years back and doesn\u0027t include works that I would consider high quality, however I also have a Steemit page which has more recent posts of a higher quality. I consider my work on these platforms to be minor if not irrelevant parts of my patreon campaign currently, but I am occasionally inspired to produce content for these platforms. However, for the time being there shall be no consistent schedule for content produced on these platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSteemit: https://steemit.com/@alberenza\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlog: \u003ca href=\"https://outtaink.wordpress.com\"\u003ehttps://outtaink.wordpress.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYoutube:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfFDE_VgOoPFQrDlHkIPuiA?view_as=subscriber\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfFDE_VgOoPFQrDlH...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnima updates with new chapters once weekly on Sundays. I\u0027ll be sure to inform you all if there are temporary/permanent changes to this schedule. I have chapters written weeks in advance so I can keep to this schedule, and also so that I have extra days to allow myself and my friends to proofread the chapters before they go public. Once weekly may be much slower than what most people are used to on Royal Roads, but that\u0027s only because I do other things in my life and I want the work to meet a decent standard before it is posted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can contact me through Discord. I lurk on the Royal Roads Discord but I do not post there, though that may change in the future as I promote Anima. At present I am not interested in running a twitter, though that can also change."
