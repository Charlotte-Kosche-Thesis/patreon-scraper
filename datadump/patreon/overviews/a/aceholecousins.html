    "summary": "Hi there! We are two cousins from se Germany. We started programming games when we were both still in basic school. It was big fun but now we\u0027ve grown up so we want money for it! And here is our revolutionary idea:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEver notice how much fun it is to run through a shopping mall with an overloaded trolley? We also did.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd ever notice how you can connect a godzillion USB controllers to a PC but nobody seems to care? We also did.\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDid you maybe also notice how powerful browsers are these days? One could basically in theory create a whole game with fantastic graphics running just in them, nothing would have to be installed. It would be awesome... wait for it... some! And we also noticed that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut enough advertising-blah! We say it is time for a new game that... like... has all this! And we make one! And because Richard Stallman is a cool dude, we make it open source and free as in free!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nGamergirls and gamergentleboys, we proudly present\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://aceholecousins.github.io/acechase/\"\u003e\u0026gt;\u0026gt; \u003cu\u003eAceChase\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0\u0026lt;\u0026lt;\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n, a massive multiplayer couch vehicular combat game. (By the way, that was a link. You can click it. Click it. Do it.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt can already be played and it is even fun already. But we want to do so much more! Lots of weapons, other vehicles, many different maps, a single player campaign, super dumb yet difficult bosses and so on!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Oh that is so super cool! Exactly what I was always missing in order to have a fulfilled life and experience true happiness! How can I contribute?\", we hear you think.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can help us by giving us all your moneys so we can afford food and shelter (and taxes and insurance and girlfriends and everything a modern person needs in the modern days) without having to work in a company like a boring adult and instead devote our time to the things that really matter: creating video games!"
