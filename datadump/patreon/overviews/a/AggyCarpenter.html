If a story asks \"What if?\" in some fashion, I\u0027m interested. While I write across a broad swath of subgenres, I most frequently write Fantasy and Horror. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(To be honest, it\u0027s hard to put a single label on things. I tend to throw everything in the creative blender and push the buttons \u0027til I don\u0027t recognize the pieces. My most recent novella trilogy is a Southern Gothic dark fantasy police procedural romance with a crunchy horror center.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on a series of Steampunk/Darkpunk novels that begin with \u003cem\u003eThe Gear\u0027d Heart\u003c/em\u003e - a new take on the Jack the Ripper mythos with a touch of Dracula in an alternate Earth timeline where magic is real and science is a (relatively) unexplored field. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I am also working on a two-part Epic Not-Fantasy series that is \"LOTR meets Terminator in a post-apocalyptic Steampunk world,\" a series of graphic novel scripts featuring Odin\u0027s queer, half-human daughter and her quest to prevent Ragnorok, and a gender-bent, comedy of manners retelling of the Hades \u0026amp; Persephone myth. As well as All The Novellas. (I have a list. It\u0027s scary long.) I also co-write a fairly regular series of short stories for the Grantville Gazette.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis gets a little complicated, but I need to solve two problems. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. \u003cstrong\u003eI need money to get to conventions.\u003c/strong\u003e Unfortunately, writing is only half the work. Publishing/selling means getting out into the wild with fans. (I.E. Attending conventions, and doing readings and events.) I have been a regular at several cons that are local to me, but it\u0027s time to start expanding and that means bigger cons and also traveling more than just an hour. Which also means paying for a hotel room, gasoline, food, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. \u003cstrong\u003eI need money to cover my bills.\u003c/strong\u003e Given the way royalties and payments for short stories are paid out (and the sporadic nature of hand-selling books at conventions) this means that some months no money comes in from writing, but bills - electric, water, internet - come every month regardless. If I want to be able to keep writing, I have to get paid for that time or I literally can\u0027t afford to use that time for making books.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are You Here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you are here because you have either read something else I\u0027ve written and are looking for more, OR you are a fan of Steampunk (or other neo-Gothic fiction) and are looking for more. Either way, welcome! Let me explain what is happening here. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a dark and delicious novel that is equal parts Steampunk and Dreadpunk that I am going to share with you - in serial format - as an introduction to what I do as an author in general, and an introduction to this particular world specifically. For $1 a month you get four chapters, and the whole novel in about a year. During which time you will be giving me the means to continue writing, help cover some of my monthly real life expenses (the electric company, alas, will not take a short story in lieu of payment), and provide the funding for me to attend the cons I have been invited to in 2018.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, I am offering ebooks and ARCs as they are released if you support at $5/month or higher which means you get early access to all my self-published stories and a trilogy of SF Western novellas coming soon from Falstaff Books. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, take a look around, read the free chapters and posts and then pass a few dollars my way and help me continue to do what I love. \u003cbr\u003e"
