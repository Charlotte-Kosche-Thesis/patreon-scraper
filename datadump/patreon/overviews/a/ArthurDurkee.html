It is the greatest gift I can give; it is what I do best. Art has never been more necessary to our well-being than it is right now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy creative work has won national and regional awards, and been recognized via gallery exhibitions, concert performances, and publications. My art has been called transformative, mythopoetic, and shamanic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI practice artistic \u201ccrop rotation\u201d in multiple media: songs and choral music; videos; photography; poems; and drawings, illustrations, and calligraphy. I write haiku like leaves falling off the back of a garden cart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIt is time to share my art with you, and I ask for your financial support to make that happen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe backing you provide helps me buy the gear and art supplies I use. Even more, your help gives me the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003etime\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I need to make art\u2014for example, to load up the van and travel the country making new photos, videos, songs, and poems. I do some of my best work when inspired by places I\u2019ve never visited before. I ask you to join me on the journey by funding me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat To Expect When You Join\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nIn return for your support, I hope to surprise and  delight you every week with my best new creations, which might include: music recordings and scores; 3 to 5 of my best photos or visual art (more if I\u2019m on fire); a poem from location and experience; or calligraphy of a quote for our times. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nEvery week I will blog at least twice about life as an artist, and about the creative process and its place in my daily life, as those are impossible to untangle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nPeriodically, I will make a short film with my music as soundtrack: for example, an ambient film assembled from my existing library of video segments made all over the United States, especially in the National Parks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAnd you\u2019ll get to see my experimental creative work. For example, I have played recently with combining live footage and animated handwriting into brush calligraphy poem-videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRewards and Prizes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\nAs a patron supporting my creativity, you will get first look at my art, including work not shared anywhere else. Much of my art-making yields up physical, tangible products, which you will the have the opportunity to own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFor example, at the end of the month, depending on what level of financial support you provide, you will have the option to receive finished artwork made during the month, which might be a CD or DVD or download of the music and/or videos I made during the month; or, a photo print of the image made during the month that you loved best; or, a work on paper, perhaps a brush pen drawing, or a papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9 fine art bowl. Don\u2019t be surprised if I make a piece, than post it with the question, \u201cWho wants this?\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOccasionally I will offer special giveaways, to be announced. And I will offer artistic products free to you as my patrons, whereas people elsewhere will have to buy them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOn a deeper level, I\u2019m not just providing my art, I\u2019m inviting you along on the journey of my artistic experience. I will take you to new places and show them with new eyes. From week to week you might never know what you\u2019re going to get, but the surprise is part of the fun. Whatever I make, wherever I am, I promise to give you my very best, and the highest quality art I can produce. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I said, I make art every day. I want to share it with you!\u003cbr\u003e"
