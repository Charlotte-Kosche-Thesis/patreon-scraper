Please take off your shoes, the carpet is new...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://simoncaine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Who.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi. My name is Simon Caine. I\u0027m a comedian who was raised on pop punk and the ethos of DIY. I started podcasting as a way of getting to talk to people who run the comedy industry to work out how it operates largely to further my own career as a DIY and indie business. The podcast now covers my journey in that area as well as the comedy industry as a whole.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://simoncaine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Upload.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make 2 pods per month so it\u0027ll cost you \u00a31.60 to send me $1 per episode per month. That\u0027s a cup of tea at Starbucks (probably, I don\u0027t drink there). You can also set a limit so you never spend more than you can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://simoncaine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Money.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t like adverts. So I need another way of making a tiny bit of money on my time investment to making podcasts [\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/ask-the-industry-podcast/id946220937\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes link\u003c/a\u003e].\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in the power of free content and community, as a result the podcasts will always be free. However, my time isn\u0027t. It takes up to 12 hours of work to make each podcast... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in. \u003cstrong\u003eThis site is basically a digital tip jar.\u003c/strong\u003e Every time I provide you with a podcast, you send me a tip. As much or as little as you like. \u003cstrong\u003eRemember that for every $1 you tip me, I get around 80p\u003c/strong\u003e (which can change depending on the exchange rate). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eDo NOT donate if you can\u0027t afford it. I don\u0027t want anyone else going into debt for this project other than me.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI\u0027d love to invest more time into the shows and travel to guests further afield as well as doing live shows. The money largely goes into maintaining kit and helping me validate taking time away from paid writing / gigs to put into the editing of an episode. Also it helps cover things like the hosting / travel etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://simoncaine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Sponsorship.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I\u0027ve been a bit hesitant to take an advert (see above). But I think this is largely because of a hang up about how long people in podcasts spend doing them (if I try your show and you spend 3 minutes talking about a tshirt company in a country I can\u0027t even order from I\u0027ll walk away no matter how good your content is).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I have no ruled it out... so if you have a \u003cstrong\u003erelevant\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0product / service email me [simon.m.caine@gmail.com]. Or if you\u0027re a brand I love (Tobleone / Innocent Smoothie / Apple etc) feel free to email as I say enough positive stuff about you for free I\u0027d love to get a bit of money for it...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://simoncaine.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Anything-else.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven for checking out the page shows you care about what I\u0027m trying to do, so thank you. Please know that every little bit helps. So do not think your pledge is low etc. I hope you have a wonderful day.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS any questions?\u00a0\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEmail me\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003ePPS prefer to do a one-off donation?
