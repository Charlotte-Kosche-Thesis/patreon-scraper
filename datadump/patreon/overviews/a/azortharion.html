    "summary": "Hello! I am Azortharion, and this is my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a 21-year old student from Denmark. I am best known in the WoW Hunter community as a theorycrafter and guidewriter, working out the best way to play all of the specs and trying to make everyone a better Hunter using this knowledge, though I am far from the only person in this effort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been doing guide writing for Hunters on various mediums since around 2014/Tier 16 when I first got started. I was a tryhard Hunter trying to get better at the time and was somewhat disappointed to find that even the most high-end Hunters at the time did not care or know much about the intricacies of the Hunter specs at the time, which put me on my own personal path towards learning everything there was to know about playing the class well, and since then, sharing it with the rest of the community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is a completely optional thing you can choose to contribute to. I am not an expensive human being to keep going in society, yet every little contribution helps me free up more and more time to produce better Hunter content - on the guidewriting front as well as Twitch streaming. Until recently I did not have any rewards, but I have recently attached some that might intrigue people - namely log reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about the log review system or this Patreon, just poke me on Discord! I would put my Discord ID here, but because my username is blank on there that\u0027s not possible. Just PM me through the Hunter Discord or my own personal Discord. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
