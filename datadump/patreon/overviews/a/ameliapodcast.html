Amelia likes the deaths to be bloody. Or creative. Death by meteor for example. Death by sheep. By bus driver. By cannon. It\u2019s an elite service and only accepts the most eccentric cases.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe creative team behind The Amelia Project is: Philip (aka \"Pip\") Thorne (co-creator), Oystein Brager (co-creator), Alan Burgon (the Interviewer), Julia Thorne (Alvina), Fredrik Baden (Sound designer) and Anders Pedersen (Graphic designer). In addition to that, in each episode, we\u2019re joined by a host of fabulous guest actors! Most of us have a background in theatre, and we\u2019re united by a passion for French cocoa and champagne.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58ff3d632e69cf9d0e239276/59b93226c027d86a49c76c56/59b9332a12abd96b121284d5/1508766797896/Answer+machine+cropped.jpg?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhere do you come from?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u2019s a difficult one! We\u2019re currently spread across France, Norway and Austria, and to make things even more complicated, most of us don\u2019t actually come from the countries in which we currently live! So far we\u2019ve recorded the show in England, Scotland, Austria and Norway. We\u2019re considering the Bahamas next. We\u2019re told they have better weather than in Norway. The question is, do they have cocoa?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58ff3d632e69cf9d0e239276/59b93226c027d86a49c76c56/59ee1628da02bce84c21f66d/1508775693351/Pip+and+Oystein+Predictions+press+photo+1+cropped.png?format=1000w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe LOVE making The Amelia Project. We love it almost as much as we love fancy cocoa. But just like cocoa from Les Deux Magots, making this podcast isn\u2019t cheap. We have to rent studios, pay hosting fees, and since we\u2019re spread across Europe, there are generally travel costs too. So far we\u2019ve just about managed to scramble from episode to episode, but it\u2019s taken a toll on our sleep, and most importantly, our savings. We really want to keep going (Amelia holds so many more surprises in store!) but in order to do so, we need to make it sustainable. Which is where you come in!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat can I do?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy the show and want us to keep making it, we would be thrilled, honoured and just chuffed to bits, if you want to support us with a per episode donation. You can support us with as much, or as little you want. Every donation counts, and even by pledging just one dollar per episode, we will love you and you will be making a huge difference and contributing to the survival of this show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eDo I get something in return?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYES!!!\u00a0This is the best bit!
