    "summary": "Hello world!! Well first off my name is Tamara but on the interwebs and with cosplay my persona is Afroqween. I currently live in a volcano aka Houston, Texas. I have not always lived here though, about 5 years ago I moved from San Antonio to the land of traffic and heat. I have been a member of the cosplay geekdom for about 12yrs now with very little sign of slowing down. It all began with a high school trip to the Dallas RenFair and boom, I was hooked. I found myself staring at the detail work on the costumes and then i realized hey...i can totally do that! And, when not sewing I\u0027m getting lost in the depths of Diablo and spending way too much time building houses in The Sims...just to burn them down in some \"freak accident\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI knew I had found my true passion whilst binge watching CardCaptors in my college dorm. Sakura had the most amazing, adorable outfits and i had to figure out a way to make my own. Mind you i was unemployed and away at college...but i had a dream. So, I started sketching out ideas, asking tons of question at the next renfair and speaking to any seamstress that didn\u0027t shoo me away.\u00a0Eventually a friend of mine taught me how to read a pattern and I havent stopped since. Now I\u0027m creating my own patterns, participating in cosplay contests, holding how-to panels, doing interviews and sewing my life away. It\u0027s been amazing so far and i cant wait to see what the future has in store!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
