    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eFor info on how patreon works, watch this video!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEUDVkwkDaw\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEUDVkwkDaw\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2605Who am I?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am Alex Ivy. I am a singer/songwriter and\nrecording artist in Seattle, WA. I spend most of my time being a creative\nmess and turning the wreckage into a melody and vision for others to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the last year, I had a successfully funded\nkickstarter campaign that helped me to create a beautiful album called Deep To\nDeep along with an accompanying music video. An experience that fulfilled a\nlife\u0027s goal and gave me an unrelenting urge to never, ever stop. I always knew this was\nwhat I was meant to do and now I have been bitten by the bug to create, once\nagain, more music and videos. The experience left me forever changed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I doing music and why it is so important? This is my story.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you were one of my kickstarter supporters,\nyou already know my story. But if not, let me explain why this is so important.\nThis isn\u0027t an easy story to share, but I believe it is incredibly necessary and\nyou will soon understand why I do what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA few years ago I was a normal young lady with\nthe whole world at my fingertips. I was active, excited, working a few jobs and\nin love. I married the man of my dreams and 2 weeks later, alone in our\napartment, I thought my life was ending. I became deathly ill out of the blue.\nWe spent a year and a half trying to hunt down the problem seeing so many\ndoctors and each one telling me to write my Will because I wouldn\u0027t make it.\nOrgan failure. Constant panic attacks which felt like heart attacks and too\nmany complications to list. Every treatment we tried made me worse. I became a\nprisoner of my apartment and of my own body. The anxiety became so severe that\nI was unable to function most days. How do you cope with being 25 and facing\nthe end of your life? You have nothing to put into a Will because you haven\u0027t\nhad time to accomplish much. And worst of all, you are dying and you can\u0027t even\nface or name the demon that is killing you because you don\u0027t know what it is.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOne day my husband put my guitar in my hands that\nI hadn\u0027t played for months and said, \"play.\" He pushed me until I did\nit and something incredible happened. For those brief couple of minutes that I\nwas focused on the melody I was playing, the pain stopped. The anxiety stopped.\nEverything froze and it was just me and the music notes swirling around the\nroom. Something so simple brought a peace I had been searching for and I knew\nwhat I had to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI had been listening to a Kari Jobe album on\nrepeat for a few months. The sound of her music brought me some peace and I\nfelt calm listening to it. It became a staple in my everyday life and helped me\novercome some really rough stuff. I realized, music is powerful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI believe things happen for a reason. I\nremembered my life\u0027s dream of creating my own album and decided that if I\nwasn\u0027t going to survive, I would leave behind something that would bring\nother people peace. Yes, a way to remember me too, but something that would let\nthem know they aren\u0027t the only ones suffering. They aren\u0027t alone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThen, few months later and we found a doctor that\nknew exactly what was wrong and how to fix it. I can\u0027t explain the feeling of\nhearing the words, \"you are going to live.\" There were several combinations of things that caused the health issues but the main thing was that our apartment had been filled with toxic black mold. It is deadly. He gave\nme hope of life and I began to get well. The process has been long and I still\nhave a ways to go, but because of his help, I was able to complete my album and\neven feel well enough to enjoy parts of it. And because of this sickness, I\nfollowed through with a dream.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy the time the album and music video were done,\nI was well on my way to recovery with a new appreciation for life and also,\nsickness. I had an empathy I never would have had. Much of my music is written\nfor others to relate to. A lot of it is to reach out to those in a rough place. Not just health wise, but emotionally. Music can help release emotions you have held on to or fill you with a new one.\nMy song \"Slipping\" was written during a time where I felt I had lost\nyears of my youth to this stupid sickness and I would never be normal again.\nSince that came out, I have gotten so many messages of people telling me how it put into words exactly how they felt.\nAnyone with long illness, or has cared for someone with it, can instantly recognize the loss and anger. This is\njust one example. I was told that my album helped someone the way the Kari Jobe\nalbum had helped me and I was flooded with gratitude and also sorrow. I hate\nthat anyone else has to deal with these things, but so happy that I was able to\ndo that for someone. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo a lot of my music can feel dark but any good\nwriter knows, you write what you know. Not all of my music is this way but I\nbelieve it has it\u0027s place and purpose.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, here I am, almost 5 years later after being\ntold my life was over and I have proved them wrong. I have another chance. And\nbecause of this horrible experience, I have a reason to keep doing music. It is\nlife changing and life sustaining. Healing, if you will.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs someone who still deals with panic attacks,\nrandom health issues and PTSD, I want to continue to give people hope by\nshowing them that just because these things are trying to chain you, you can\nwin. That is why, through sickness and panic attacks, I still climb up on that\nstage, drag myself to the studio and do interviews. Because I refuse to let it\nwin and I refuse to let others suffer alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u2605Why am I on Patreon?\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. I wish to connect with you on a more personal level and get to know those who believe in me and what I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Getting letters, emails and meeting fans who told me how a song changed their life or how it made them feel has to be the best feeling in the world. My intention in all of my music is for the listener to be able to relate and find peace in the fact that they are not alone in whatever they are going through. THAT, is why I do what i do. After the kickstarter experience, I realized that this art is pointless without others being a part of it. So I want YOU to join me on this journey to create more content to reach out to even more folks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Financially, I can not create the visions I have, alone. And after the incredible feedback and touching stories that followed my last project, I realized that there is so much more to do. It took a community behind me to show me how important music is. It is not a sale or just a song. It is an experience that creates an emotion. And the emotion changes how we see the world around us. But it takes money to do that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2605So why should you become my patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e1.\u00a0I have created a multitude of rewards for each contribution tier you choose. Many of them are ways for us to connect, but it is also a guarantee that your contribution will be going toward a great cause and you will see results.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. When you pledge to my project, you are helping\nsupport a creative vision and you will get to be part of this amazing experience. Not only will I be recording MUCH more music and\nreleasing a ton more of content, I will also be working on videos and tours. There are a bunch of perks as far as rewards go. However, if you believe in what I do, the reason I do it and you want to be involved in the arts to help it grow, this is the place for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy goal is to\nrelease 1 video per month, however, I will not be able to do this until we\nreach our first couple of goals. So until that time, I will be recording and\nreleasing new songs. Mainly original music with a few covers mixed in. Always\nsomething in the works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
