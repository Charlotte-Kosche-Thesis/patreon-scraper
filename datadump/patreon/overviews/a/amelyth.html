A lot of which I do live on Stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI truly love the art I do, and I have so much fun learning new styles, new mediums and new techniques, and being able to share it with you on stream is a dream come true! I would love for twitch and my art and crochet to become a sustainable job, and I\u2019m willing to put in the time and effort to help the community grow and make it even more amazing than you\u2019ve already helped it become!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve worked hard to create a positive, chill environment on Twitch that welcomes everyone, including you! Unfortunately; as I\u2019m sure you know, this doesn\u2019t put food on the table or help contribute to household bills. Which is why I\u2019ve got a patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach and every patron helps me reduce the amount of commissions I need to take on to be able to live and eat and be able to share my art journey with you! It also allows me to pursue my life dream of doing more of my own personal art and creating my own characters! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to improve and expand on all my art with new techniques and styles. It also means I can put more time into creating my own crochet patterns, with the hope being to put them all together and publish my own book.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging even just $1, you are helping me work toward the ultimate goal \u2013 Doing my art, my crochet and my work on stream and allowing me to put food in my belly! And we both know, T-rexes tend to eat a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to become an official Patron of mine, you will gain a special t-rex egg key that allows you access to some awesome and fun exclusive Patron-only content which will include: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTimelapses 1-2 weeks before the public sees them.\u003cbr\u003eMonthly wallpaper\u003cbr\u003eInvite to the Patreon \u0026amp; Twitch MC server\u003cbr\u003eColoring pages from the month in a .pdf \u003cbr\u003eAccess to Patreon only posts\u003cbr\u003eDiscord and Rabbit invites\u003cbr\u003eTier specific bonus content\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to stop by my patreon, I look forward to furthering my art and creative content journey with you all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmelyth\u003cbr\u003e"
