Also, because this page is mostly dedicated to getting Foreign firmly on its feet, I\u0027m releasing a side story on a one chapter-per-month schedule.

I LOVE all things comics, art, and writing. Creativity is the most beautiful gift we\u0027ve been afforded as humans. But, at times, it\u0027s also the most frustrating. All I\u0027d ever wanted to do was to tell my own stories, but I\u0027ve spent my entire career bringing the stories of others to the page. So in 2007 I established Ariotstorm Productions LLC./ Peanut Butter Joe Studios to, finally, publish my own independent work. My day job (drawing for industry) supported my hobby (drawing for myself). I printed my books, sold them only at conventions, grew my brand, and my product line while keeping the cost to consumers low...and my pockets empty.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0\u00a0As rates-per-page drop, bills get higher, and the cost of resupplying increases all at once I\u0027ve found it impossible to go on without making some changes. I\u0027m still trying to figure out exactly what those \u00a0should be. The industry has changed, the independent scene has grown exponentially with the advent of Kickstarter and Patreon, it\u0027s hard to know where to begin.

It\u0027s been years since I\u0027ve had to \"spawn\" a character out of thin air. Even the background ones were once the lead of their own stories.

Patreon isn\u0027t forever. The best day would\nbe when I\u0027m able to take down this page. Sometimes it seems feasible that my\ncomic books would be in bookstores under my own imprint, and that I could walk\ninto Barnes \u0026amp; Noble and Foreign would be on the shelf. I\u0027ve seen so many\ntry, and I\u0027ve heard so many tales of woe that it\u0027s hard to think that I could\naccomplish it. I\u0027ve been on my journey way alone, so far. But maybe with\na little help, a lot of editing, and your well-wishes I can finally tell my\nstory.\u003cbr\u003e"
