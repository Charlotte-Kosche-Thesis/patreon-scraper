Thank you for checking out my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Alex Mason and I am a multi-discipline adventurer, writer, speaker, designer, enthusiastic photographer and wannabe filmmaker. As of the beginning of 2018 I have hiked over 7000 miles on long distance trails \u2013 including the Pacific Crest Trail in America and the Te Araroa in New Zealand, I\u2019ve cycled 4000 miles across Australia and Indonesia, and I\u2019ve climbed a few mountains including Kilimanjaro and Mera Peak in the Himalayas. I also have an ocean rowing adventure and an 8000m peak somewhere in my future.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOne of the hardest things about my journeys is keeping a daily blog, when sometimes the last thing you want to do in the evening is spend an hour writing about your day when all you want to do is stuff your face with chocolate and go to sleep! My blog started out as a personal record and a way of updating my mum and dad about what I was doing, but it has grown significantly beyond that and I have been lucky enough to pick up some dedicated followers along they way, some of whom have become friends. How cool is that?! \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you don\u2019t ask, you\u2019ll never know\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never asked anyone for any money, aside from the donations to my chosen charity, and I have self funded all of my adventures and I will continue to do so \u2026 BUT\u2026 as the journeys have increased so has the content on my blog to the point where I have about 4 books worth of stories and I have now outgrown my little Wordpress site. In order for me to be able to continue sharing my stories I would like to move the blog onto a self hosted site which will give me a lot more creative control, enable me to make all my images hi-res and allow me to produce more content while using my design skills to their full potential \u2013 and with the triple crown (Appalachian Trail and Continental Divide Trail) and other trails in my sights, plus an ocean row\u2026I still have a lot of stories to share. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThe cost of the website, which includes hosting, storage and domain costs, would work out at approximately $30 per month. Being able to cover those costs would be so amazing and it would only mean 15 blog readers donating $2 a month\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the dream scenario that the level of support goes above and beyond that, it would mean I could invest in a new camera and a new phone to improve the quality of the content I share, new gear and maybe an improved diet on the trail. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePlease pledge to me so I can continue to develop my website, and in turn my writing and photography, so I can continue to entertain you for as little as the cost of a cup of coffee a month.\u003cbr\u003e"
