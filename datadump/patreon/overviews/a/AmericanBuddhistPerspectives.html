I\u0027ve become part of amazing communities of fellow writers and digital explorers of Buddhism. Readers, supporters, commenters, collaborators, and friends have meant the world to me over that time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2012 I started my first \u0027regular\u0027 part-time teaching job during my Ph.D. studies in Buddhist Ethics. I continue to do that work, but\u00a0I\u0027m hoping to step out of the \"adjunct trap\" and possibly academia entirely in order to focus on serving my local community and deepening my bonds to you, my blog readers, through growing our mutual commitments to understanding and practice. Buddhism has changed my life and I hope it has yours too; but these days I think truth is bigger than the label \"Buddhism\" and is found in philosophy, in mindfulness practice, in supportive community, in seeking out \u003cstrong\u003ethe good life\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy become a patron?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e1: access to the patron-only material\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e2: \u003cstrong\u003eto support the work here. \u003c/strong\u003eBig newspapers like the Guardian request donations from readers in every story. Others give you a few stories each month or have permanent paywalls. Renowned writer Nicholas Kristof lamented recently that \"our old business model has collapsed, and we simply must find new ways to raise money and pay for journalism.\" Academia is in much the same crisis and while I, and others, seek to work that out (I\u0027d still love a steady full-time job!), models like this allow work to go on \u003cem\u003eand compensation to come back\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e3: \u003cem\u003eBuild the gift economy\u003c/em\u003e. The work of providing new perspectives on Buddhism, philosophy, mindfulness, and so on is precious to me. I can\u0027t put a price tag on it because I don\u0027t want to restrict it from anyone. Your support ensures that I can put the time and effort into reaching out to people, building connections, doing research, writing, editing, and sharing these perspectives.\u003cbr\u003e"
