We did that and then we did a couple more things, like getting married and having a baby. A Greek baby in the Netherlands. And the research freak that I am, I started looking for great \u003cstrong\u003eeducational material for bilingual children\u003c/strong\u003e the moment I found out I was pregnant. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGuess what. There isn\u0027t much out there! Especially when it comes to strange language combinations, like Greek and Dutch or Finnish and Greek (hi Marja-Ilona and Dimitris!). I joined bilingual education groups and started asking people what it was they were missing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany parents had to buy the same book in two or even three different languages, in order to help their kids strengthen their language skills. I wondered \u003cstrong\u003ewhy not put both languages in one book and save some space\u003c/strong\u003e? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xap1/t31.0-8/p600x600/10845852_356904211178806_6560067335770928012_o.jpg\" style=\"width: 387px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s how my first book, Lou, was born. Well, it was born because of that need and my personal need to prove to myself that I could still be creative and productive after becoming a mom.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read more about Lou \u003ca href=\"http://thenonhiphippies.org/lou/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. But here is the short version: \u003cstrong\u003eI believe that kids are small humans. They have brains and they have aesthetics. And their aesthetics is influenced by what they see and what they are exposed too. Therefore it is important to expose them to high-quality material both in terms of language and in visual terms.\u003c/strong\u003e There are some amazing children\u0027s books out there that do that, but unfortunately they are not bilingual. And the ones that are are not translated in the languages that interest me (and thousands of other parents).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/l/t31.0-8/p640x640/10521729_351125695089991_8615392534681393380_o.jpg\" style=\"width: 397px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt seems that many other parents agree with me, for the first \"Lou\" book was a great success, considering it was self-published and printed locally. And this is how I want to keep things. Hand-made, local and ethical. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you pay for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrinting Costs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt doesn\u0027t make sense to print a children\u0027s book in a third-world country or a country full of sweatshops, where it will be kids printing books for kids. But printing locally means a higher cost. A cost that I am more than willing to pay, to support local businesses. Additionally, I would like to print on recycled paper, when possible, \u0027cause our children need a planet to live on as well, when they grow up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/t31.0-8/q81/p600x600/1522791_338526356349925_2087721214737347685_o.jpg\" style=\"width: 353px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTranslation Costs\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first translators have been kind enough to accept a very low payment, in order to make this project possible.
