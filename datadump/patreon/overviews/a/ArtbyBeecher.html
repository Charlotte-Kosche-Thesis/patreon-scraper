I feel I have been an artist all my life, but wasn\u0027t able to devote myself to painting full time until I moved to England in 2002 on an artist visa. There I was able to develop my art business exhibiting in London, Paris and Herefordshire. I built a substantial body of artwork and a following of collectors.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://server132.clik.com/artbybeecher/images/AmerBrits.JPG\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nAbout two years ago circumstances brought me back to the States. I\u0027ve since resettled in North Carolina to be near my family and grandchildren.\u00a0And now it\u0027s time to get back in the studio and create new artwork.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately,\u00a0it isn\u0027t all that easy \"starting over\" at my age and I\u0027d love your help relaunching my art career. I\u0027m obsessed with creating art\u00a0\u2014 it\u0027s the most fun I\u0027ve ever had doing anything. The older I get, the more ideas I seem to have, and the more urgently I want to paint, but I also still need to make a living and not everyone who loves my artwork is ready for a new painting each month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe way Patreon works is art lovers can donate whatever they want per month and the donation is recurring each month after that. So anything, from $1/month up, is hugely helpful to the cause.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat I\u0027ll Use the Money For\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy initial goal is $5,000/month. That money plus income from sales will be enough to support me, indefinitely. Here are Art by Beecher costs:\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe internet.\u003c/strong\u003e Online exposure is crucial in building a new audience here in the States and reconnecting with collectors worldwide. But, when it comes to computers, I am a total technophobe. Not only do I not know what most of the following things are, I need others to do them or make them happen: website, online galleries, email platforms, newsletter, photography and photo editing, video editing, patron feeds, facebook boosts...\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tHere\u0027s where you can find my art online:\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.artbybeecher.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Website - www.artbybeecher.com\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.artfinder.com/artist/rodney-beecher-roberts/artworks/?collections=p__all-artworks\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOnline Gallery - Artfinder\n\t\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ArtbyBeecher/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSocial Media - Facebook\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://shopvida.com/collections/beecher?page=2 target=\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eClothing Designs - Shop VIDA\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt materials.\u003c/strong\u003e Paint, varnish, canvas, panels, matts, frames, and when building a body of work for an exhibition, storage space.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOne employee.\u003c/strong\u003e As explained above need someone to handle all things techie and a bunch of other little jobs like writing press releases, archiving artwork, and researching galleries, grants and residencies. These things end up adding up to a few hours every day, and without this employee, I end up asking my wife to do it all and she has much less time to do her work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMe.\u003c/strong\u003e I need to continue to eat things, buy new guitar strings, rent a movie or two from redbox, and occasionally wear something other than paint spattered clothes.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat\u0027s the basics. With those pieces covered, Art by Beecher can support itself. Once Art by Beecher is sustainable I will start working toward the \"Stretch Goals\" - exhibitions and projects that I want to achieve over the next year or two.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnyway, for now the goal is to get up and running and I appreciate your support whether that\u0027s becoming a patron or sharing my art with your family and friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e"
