    "summary": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m AyeforScotland and since 2013 I have been running a blog on Tumblr. I started as a political blog and I support Scottish independence. I\u0027m very engaged in the world of politics and I really enjoy \u00a0writing my blog and discussing current events with everyone. I\u0027ve answered questions, analysed political events and there is a fantastic community, without which I wouldn\u0027t still be here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, I\u0027ve wanted to work a bit harder on the AyeforScotland brand so I\u0027ve been putting my time into streaming on twitch and creating videos on Youtube while also keeping up the same level of blog posts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u0027d like to continue to produce content and work up to directing my own films. I\u0027ll keep up my current level of production at the moment but if you\u0027d like to see more I\u0027ll need your help. At the current moment these videos would consist of fun game-play videos either of play-throughs or with some political discussion but I would also like to interview those on my blog about why they believe in Scottish independence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for finding my page and I hope we get to know each other in due course.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours for Scotland,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAye\u003cbr\u003e"
