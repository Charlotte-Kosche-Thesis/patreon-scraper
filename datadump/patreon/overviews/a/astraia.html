For the most part, I kept my ideas to myself and did not do much to make them a reality.\u00a0\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eI was to scared to make or do anything because of the fear it might not be good enough, that I might not be good enough\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Enough with the boring stuff!!!

Do you need more?*(actually yes, more would be very useful... I apologize)*\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI have a few different rewards levels that you can choose from, each gaining more access to content or physical rewards as the price goes up.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe rewards start at 5$ a month\u003c/strong\u003e, and at this level you will gain access to an exclusive weekly set, typically posted every friday! These can be shot either by a professional, or by myself on my own DSLR. \u003cstrong\u003eEvery set will be available at the posted link for one month, and then will be available only on my archive for 15$ + patrons!\u003c/strong\u003eMore reward levels and descriptions of what you will receive are listed under the rewards section to the right. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere are also \u003cstrong\u003eother reward levels beginning at 20$ that receive physical prints\u003c/strong\u003e, handwritten notes, or one of a kind instax!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have also added a new 35$ tier which will gain access to Livestream\u0027s that will occur anywhere from every couple of days to once a week \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e(at the least)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\nAnd then the greatest reward level, I think, is the 100$ level! (of which there can only be 10!) At this level you will get to personally direct a set just for your eyes,\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e you get to choose the theme, location, outfits (or lack thereof), and any other details you could possibly imagine!\n\u003cblockquote\u003e*Please note that I am not in porn or offer any sexual services, and set requests can not include any spreadshots, smut, or pornographic content, but I am always happy to create artistic/erotic nude images*\u00a0\u003c/blockquote\u003eI have a wide variety of online content, and tons of posts from since i began patreon. Once you pledge, you will gain access to all posts at your tier level, and those at tier levels below you. Some posts are also eventually opened to the public, but you will always know how long you have before everyone else can see the post.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll of my patreon subscribers at any level will get access to weekly friday sets, often nude and always uncensored, as well as the option to order prints and request custom photos at a discounted rate. \u003c/strong\u003eAt other levels, you will get exclusive access to the behind the scenes of my instagram and photo shoots, statements and background for #stageone, and tons of other videos from art to vlogs. You can read my silly ramblings at the 10$ tier blogs, and since I know there won\u0027t be creepers here, I have a feeling I will be sharing much more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust below is a picture which I took the first day I got my own DSLR, ever since then I have been itching to have a little group of peers who are truly interested in my work to share my art with :D\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eMore about me:\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been creating art on and off for almost 4 years now. I am currently working towards a B.oS in Anthropology, as well as a B.oA in Art History at a small liberal arts university in LA. Strangely enough, I\u0027m one of those weird people who actually loves to go to school, learning new things, writing papers, etc. After gaduation I would like to continue on to get a Doctorate, as I hope to do research with modern artists focusing on their creative process, as well as open my open gallery space(or dig up ancient artifacts in Europe, or study classical narratives historical effect on artistic movements, or something else, I really don\u0027t know yet). I have always been fascinated by why artists choose the subjects and colors palates they use, and when I realized there was an entire field dedicated to the study of art, I was hooked.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\n\t\u003c/div\u003e\n\tAnd then on a different plane, \u00a0in 2013 a co-worker showed me the Suicide Girls website; I was amazed at the confidence and beauty all the girls had. I wanted to start right away, I began planning my first shoot immediately and since then I have participated in countless photo shoots, a number of video shoots, and even one film! Modeling was the perfect compromise to get my creative ideas flowing and ease my anxieties and stress with school. Now with my photography, taking the role of the creator has given me a deeper respect for the creative process and how important it is to trust myself and what I create. I am so grateful to have a community who supports me and continues to engage with my content daily.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
