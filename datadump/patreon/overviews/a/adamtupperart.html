Since 2010 I\u0027ve been completely self-employed with various projects, my own art being the main focus. I\u0027m a pencil/paint artist primarily and occasionally dabble in graphic design. I\u0027ve been selling my work online since 2008, at local art shows in Ottawa since 2009 and travelling to comic conventions since 2010.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a self-employed artist is extremely difficult. There are no days off, no real vacation, no health benefits, long hours, an often fickle marketplace and the very real risk that at the end of the month, there just isn\u0027t enough money to pay bills and rent. Make no mistake, I would not trade places with anyone else as I love my career more than anything. However it is important to stress just how difficult it can be living as an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. Assisting me in my financial stability will help to ensure I am able to continue to create 24/7, 365. Your contribution helps me to purchase materials for existing and upcoming projects, hotel and travel expenses as I travel to different national and international shows and conventions, shipping and handling to more remote areas, booking events that otherwise would be unavailable given my existing financials, and perhaps most importantly, day to day living expenses such as food, bills and rent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more money that is contributed, the more I\u0027m able to share my work with the world at large. This also translates into perks and exclusive pieces that only Patreon patrons are able to access. The goal is not so much to accept funds from angel investors, but showcase the work being done in a much larger scale and reward those who have helped to make any successes occur.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtists should always respect and love those who make their lives better. I am no different. Without support from persons such as yourselves, I would still be working for a major bank and would be quite miserable. Thank you in advance for considering giving your hard-earned funds to a simple creator like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-AT"
