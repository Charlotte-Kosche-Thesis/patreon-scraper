    "summary": "Hi! My name is Kevi and I am the creator behind Alfa Guy, a YouTube channel about automotive history.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI decide to start this YouTube channel when I was searching for the story of Cizeta V16T, but I couldn\u0027t find anything, beside the fact that the car had two Lamborghini V8 engines, which turned out to be completely false. So I decided to do some research and to share these stories with other petrolheads. But because I didn\u0027t have the right equipment\u0027s I started making these cheese Top list/Compilations videos. Thankfully with the money that I got from YouTube I bought a microphone and with my terrible English I started to make the videos that I wanted to make since the beginning. This was the first reason the second one was that I wanted to meet other petrolheads who shared the same passion with me. I\u2019m from Albania and beside the typical Mercedes fanboy is hard to find true car guys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut why am I here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3IjoxNjAwfQ%3D%3D/patreon-posts/qYn1XzhwdSZA6QcmeG0HOoEZ52ZIMTRLyHAoR8bdpktLWkrK8lZF0acqddRO2WR1.jpg?token-time=2145916800\u0026amp;token-hash=yz5eyYSA58xQ0nxDgKtF7GMGO7UFn-ecFJZNZ_doHFo%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been relied on YouTube payments only. But they go ups and downs and for a channel of my size that are not very good. Because of the the topics that I pick which are not for everyone plus the fact that my English isn\u0027t perfect, I don\u0027t get many views. So because of that I had to start my Patreon page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Goal\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c10.patreonusercontent.com/3/eyJ3IjoxNjAwfQ%3D%3D/patreon-posts/ZTV-POORJ5PsJleJ_0-q3tO2_N4zTzpFogKzpQOtroLJahGDpI89KBoMvh5RXfIb.jpg?token-time=2145916800\u0026amp;token-hash=QF815PA0KZ3Wub5sGp9R_2a6InJ-cKG_lnC7UrvgmbI%3D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThere are three major reasons why I\u2019am here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy current laptop is very very slow and with tons bugs, so is very hard to edit the videos.

If you have any questions for me you can just hit me on my Instagram page and if you have any suggestions just leave it in the comments of my videos and you would see that video some time in the future.\u003cbr\u003e"
