    "summary": "Hi folks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Bryant \"BC\" Chambers. You may know me as the \"Monetization Guy\" on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you may not know is that\u00a0my real passion is creating\u00a0opportunities to impact people\u0027s lives in a positive way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot too long ago, I spent quite a few years producing gaming content on my YouTube channel called Alloy Seven. However, as time went on and my channel grew, more and more of my viewers wanted me to help them build their own valuable gaming and entertainment channels on YouTube.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike any good soldier, I answered the call and dedicated the majority of my time to helping gamers and other entertainers succeed on YouTube with over one hundred hours of free coaching.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eToday, I\u0027m asking for your help to allow me to keep producing this type of content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, the coaching I provide is very niche. Instead of giving creators gimmicky tips videos they could easily read on the most popular blogs, I focus on providing the deep knowledge I\u0027ve gathered over the 20 years I\u0027ve spent coaching military leaders, big-business professionals and entertainers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, given the short attention span of most of YouTube\u0027s regulars, two-hour, personalized coaching videos are not at the top of Google\u0027s list of things to promote.\u00a0As such, I pretty much create these videos at a loss. The hours I spend preparing for and filming these sessions comes at a great cost to my family and my primary business (you know...the stuff I do to feed my family *smile*).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, I\u0027ve recently begun transitioning Alloy Seven to provide coaching and consultation to businesses who need help creating brand awareness and marketing and selling their products with online video (you know...the people who can afford $50-$1000 for the in-depth training I provide).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile solo-creators, gamers and entertainers can certainly benefit from this more business-focused coaching I\u0027ll be providing, the reality is that many of the creators I\u0027ve helped don\u0027t really want to run a business. They just want to know how to grow their community and enjoy making content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd while I do have paid programs that still help gamers and entertainers on a more personal level, I\u0027ve learned over the years that many of my starving artists can\u0027t really afford the price tag.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you fall into this group, I don\u0027t want to leave you hanging. Maybe you cannot afford $50 for our basic program or $1000 for our advanced training. But, I imagine that you can certainly afford $1 or maybe even $10 bucks a month to support the continuation of these longer-form, individual-focused coaching sessions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf that\u0027s true, I invite you to support me here on Patreon. No amount is too small and no amount is too big!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I asking for your support?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support enables me to keep the proverbial lights on at Alloy Seven such that I may continue producing free videos to spread good ideas and impact lives in a positive way.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsulting and training fees can cost anywhere from $100 - $10,000 per hour in the corporate world. Your support enables me to help you and other creators who may not be able to afford such fees to continue building your channels and sharing your voices on YouTube.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also help me acquire the necessary equipment and hire the right staff to allow me to produce content more frequently and professionally. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost importantly, you\u0027ll help me to free up more time to spend with my first love: my family! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all this in mind, if contributing to our vision financially would put any type of strain on you or your family, please do not become a patron at this time. Trust me when I tell you that I know what it\u0027s like to live on a tight budget or even in a check-to-check situation. Your first priority should always be you and the ones you love when it comes to your hard-earned cash. For now, allow me to continue serving you with our free content and by responding to your questions on our videos.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to know more about me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is BC and I\u0027ve been helping clients develop their brand presence online since 2005 (Web Design, Web Development, Public Relations and Communications). I\u0027ve served as a consultant for many organizations from the federal government, to non-profit institutions, to small business owners working to sell their goods and services online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBehind that corporate facade lives a passionate musician and video game fanatic. I played in numerous bands playing live shows as far back as 1998. In 2004 I built my own online gaming community where I shared my amateur game reviews. I\u0027ve also served as a moderator for Sony\u0027s Playstation Underground community. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen my son was born, I had to hang up my microphone to focus on my family and my business (I kept writing reviews, though). My music and desire to entertain would take a back seat. Then came my attempts to make music and comedy videos on YouTube in 2007. They were pretty terrible, but a solid introduction to the YouTube platform.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://videocreators.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/youtube-certified-dark.png\" style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 25px 15px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eFast-forward to 2012 when I started Alloy Seven as a channel designed to combat what I felt were industry game reviews that lacked empathy for the players watching them. I wanted to use my channel to help fellow video game fanatics understand what \u003cem\u003ethey\u003c/em\u003e would experience in a game versus just telling them what I experienced. So my small team of writers and friends created our \u003cem\u003eGamer Category Review System\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013 I ran into numerous problems uploading my game reviews and let\u0027s plays thanks to YouTube\u0027s very strict Content ID system. I used my connections in the press to get in contact with the major game developers and publishers to ask them for permission to make and publish my work. To my surprise, many of them were extremely timely and helpful in getting me the permission I needed to run my channel and monetize it properly.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI published all of my findings on our website and eventually made videos to support it with hopes that other creators going through the same pain would find it helpful in managing their content and their channels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that together, we can accomplish what none of us can do alone. We can build a stronger gaming community free of the stigma that follows us around today. That\u0027s why I want to help other creators like me who are putting in countless hours to build their channels on a crowded platform. I would be humbled and honored if you would share in our vision and support us with your time and money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support! It really does mean the world to me and my family.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
