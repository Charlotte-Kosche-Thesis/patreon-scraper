    "summary": "Hello, and, welcome,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Aris Zavitsanos and come this fall I will be launching the first book in my \"Theomachy\" series. For five long years, I have been forging this world while at the same time going to school and working. Over the last two years, the story has grown extraordinarily, and I have been entirely consumed by it. All I want to do is write, and although I am writing four to six hours a day, it\u0027s still not enough.\u00a0My dream is to establish a studio where writers and artists collaborate co-creating the world within, a place where the imagination can be objectified. In order to achieve this, I must lead by example and first create my world. I believe that when people work together towards a project and are having fun in the process as well as learning and growing, the dream manifests much faster. For this reason, I have decided to share the process with you and reach out to the world. We are living in a phenomenal time where people from all over the world can communicate and work together. For example, I have two artists working on projects for the book right now, one is in Colombia and the other Indonesia. Without the internet, I would have never had the opportunity of working with these amazing people. The internet is a resource the greatest inhibitor of creativity it allows us to find a means that isn\u0027t initially present we can google questions, watch how-to videos, start discussions, or even fund projects. Today, there is no excuse for not chasing your dreams, the moment is now. This actualization has allowed me to focus causing content to spew from my ears; I am in a perpetual state of creativity, and I have finally gotten to the point where I would like to share my world with you!!!\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a constant state of survival, humanity fights alongside the Gods of Ancient Greece to defend their position atop the food chain. This ever-growing\u00a0battle began in 650 B.C. some 2665 years ago when Gaia spread her toxic jungles across the Earth. These jungles mutated the animals that lived within giving birth to the creatures which today endanger\u00a0humanity. Along with the beasts, a race born of the trees emerged known as the Forgotten. A wild and tribal race the Forgotten held many abilities that made them superior to the ordinary human. To protect their domain and even the playing ground, the gods returned to earth gifting humanity Diafotisi an AI unit which enabled man to access more of their mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemaining on Earth to oversee its protection the Gods created 12 Kingdoms which have become the safe havens for humanity. Within the kingdoms, society flourishes and those capable of fighting in honor of the Gods defend their walls training to attain the gift of Diafotisi. Neural upgrades are available for the public but Diafotisi the pinnacle of AI integration is only used in higher ranking military officers as well as people found in the scientific division. After 1000\u0027s of years of constructing their kingdoms on Earth tension\u00a0between the Gods grew, so 100 years ago they took a leave of absence to settle their differences and come up with a solution to humanities dilemma. Upon leaving, they\u00a0left a select few in charge of their kingdoms as well as an\u00a0incentive for humankind to progress. They promised to award those responsible for bettering the human condition with demigodhood, an honor\u00a0unseen since they first appeared. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKazi a 16-year-old boy smarter than his own good has grown up in an age void of the Gods physical presence and dreams of a life unrestrained by walls.\u00a0It is Trials Day, the time when one decides their significance to society and although every position is considered\u00a0admirable those willing to put their lives on the line attain the highest honor. Kazi along with his teammate Thana have trained to join the most demanding military division of all the Exo Regiment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where book one takes off and where our journey with Kazi begins. My dream for this project is to create a world that people want to fill with their own content a place we can dream of together and watch as it comes into existence. I am all for community\u00a0participation and would love feedback, story ideas, art concepts just about anything that will engage people\u0027s creativity. As for content, I will keep my supporters updated on my progress every other day and will be providing concept art weekly. When I reach my set goal, I will hire an editor and\u00a0release a monthly short story that takes place within Kazi\u0027s universe. Already this Patreon has added an extra incentive to my project and the progress has been monumental. There are many projects underway and not enough hours in the day so let\u0027s work together in forging this world, Kazi, and I have a lot to show you!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e"
