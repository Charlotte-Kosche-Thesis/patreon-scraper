You can sell your ALIs or buy others ALIs using the profits generated and you can send payment with them to anyone\u2019s email.

Which is why you are not allowed to give me any funds to raise the ALIs capital, this is not an ICO nor a cryptocurrency. You will have control over the fund as a crowd with the decisions you make.
