Everything that we do within Team Debo is for our CF community and it is our hope that everyone gleans something from us, whether it be a new exercise routine, a favorite recipe, a motivational moment or simply feeling as loved as they should. Ultimately, our goal is to keep defying the odds for as long as God grants us on His earth and to prove every day that love really is the cure for everything \ud83d\ude0d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we are active on Facebook and Instagram under @TeamDeboForLife; and Farrel\u0027s blog is located at ChronicallyChayil.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
