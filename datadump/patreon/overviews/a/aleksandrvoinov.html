    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an author with a day job and big plans; I have written circa 60-70 novels, novellas and short stories - at some point I\u0027ll come back with an exact estimate, but that\u0027s a pretty solid guess at this point. I\u0027ve had not one, but two agents, won many Rainbow and other awards, finalled\u00a0 in the Lambda Literary Award, and my books have been published by big and small publishers, ranging from Random House/Heyne,\u00a0Harlequin/Carina Press to Samhain Publishing and Dreamspinner Press. My books have been translated into Japanese, German, French and Italian (and at least one fan translation into Spanish). They always feature queer main characters who fall in love, have adventures (often both) and generally thrive and prevail.\u00a0In 2015, I struck out on my own as self-published author because I wanted to publish books closer to the date they were actually finished. A traditional publisher will sit on your book for 8-24 months, which is all dead waiting time. I wanted to get my projects simply faster into the hands of my readers. In addition, being an independent operator means I can produce my own audiobooks and write the books I want to write - rather than write to market or a publisher\u0027s specifications.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaybe let\u0027s start with what this is not. This is not an attempt to quit my day job and get me a living wage from my writing. I really like and enjoy my day job and I work in an industry that pays me well and takes care of pension payments and healthcare. \u003cem\u003e[This part may get updated should my industry decide that mass layoff are necessary to survive Brexit, but hey, right now I\u0027m good.] \u003c/em\u003eThat said, should this be stupendously successful, I might at least consider going part-time, which would allow me to spend more time writing. Let\u0027s consider this a far distant goal for the moment. One I\u0027d \u003cem\u003ereally \u003c/em\u003enot mind achieving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what \u003cem\u003ewould\u003c/em\u003e you be helping me with? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis one is a two-for-one.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eThere\u0027s a thing I really want to do, and that\u0027s to get more of my work made into audiobooks and different languages, namely German, French and Italian. Those cost a lot of money - producing a decent quality audiobook of a novel easily runs into $2,000-3,500 each, and that\u0027s just the narrator\u0027s time. I\u0027ve had a couple audiobooks produced and the money I get back doesn\u0027t pay for creating the audiobooks in the first place. Translations run into $1,500-3,000 easily, depending on the language. It\u0027s a rare translation that makes that money back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make some money from writing, but that doesn\u0027t stretch very far to pay for audiobooks or translations, and I don\u0027t want to produce more cheaply than that - in audio and in translating, as in everything, you really get what you pay for and I don\u0027t want to stiff a fellow creative on their fees to be able to afford those shiny extras. You\u0027d help me produce versions of my work I couldn\u0027t otherwise afford to make, and allow me to make it accessible for people who prefer to listen to them or read them in their native language - and you\u0027ll have my gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA more personal reason is this: I\u0027m here to build a community.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027ve hemmed and hawed about this for years, but I\u0027ve finally reached the conclusion that my other social media platforms are not great at enabling community. Goodreads, Facebook and Twitter don\u0027t seem really useful to connect on a constant basis with my readers (I don\u0027t even know whether people see my updates on Facebook since I refuse to pay them to \"boost\" my posts), and if they are, they\u0027re not great at sharing content such as PDFs or text. A community would help me to get a better sense of who you are, what you enjoy and whether I\u0027m on the right track. I\u0027ve met plenty of readers on my travels and during cons and via email and Twitter and Facebook (and \u003cem\u003enone of that will change\u003c/em\u003e - I\u0027m not locking myself behind a paywall), so I have a bit of an idea, but I think that could get a whole lot better - especially considering that Patreon is a perfect platform to accomplish that. Being a writer can be very navel-gazery, because we sit in a room in front of a screen and mostly talk to people who don\u0027t exist, and very often we only hear from readers whether they loved a certain thing many months (or years) after the book is out and our head is full of the new one.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to cross that distance and close that gap. I want to make the process \u003cstrong\u003eimmediate\u003c/strong\u003e for both you and me. I really believe it could be a hell of a lot more fun. We\u0027ll get to talk about characters, plot twists, new project ideas I\u0027m tossing around (you likely even get a vote on those), and just hang out and enjoy the experience. I believe feedback will make my journey better and motivate me to write when I might be feeling flat (it happens). It\u0027s easier to write when you know people care and are actually waiting for that next chapter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat can you expect?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve followed me on Twitter or Facebook, you\u0027ll know I\u0027m pretty active on social media and will post snippets and random stuff relating to books I\u0027ve written, but mostly books I\u0027m currently working on. This Patreon will be like that, but have \u003cstrong\u003emuch more\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0content and be even more interactive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDepending on the tier,\u003c/strong\u003e this is what\u0027s in it for you:\u003cbr\u003e- The happy feeling of supporting me as I create more than I could normally do, faster and better. \u003cbr\u003e- Random stuff, like playlists, inspirations, book reviews/recommendations. My brain is a busy and colourful place, and you get a front row seat to see me work, think and plan\u003cbr\u003e- Blog posts, snippets and even full chapters (in first draft) of the book/s I\u0027m currently working on as I\u0027m working on them, typos and messy bits including. Once a chapter is ready, it gets posted here. You can discuss it with others and with me, and you\u0027ll get it at the same time as my close friends and beta readers. I\u0027ll read your reactions, answer questions and might even use your feedback to make the book better.\u003cbr\u003e- You\u0027ll get an absolutely unique insight into the books as they grow - I\u0027ll be writing a \"director\u0027s commentary\" version of every piece I post that includes my thinking on the piece, maybe research notes, playlists or photos; whatever is suitable for the piece.\u003cbr\u003e- Deleted scenes (should I delete anything - I very rarely do)\u003cbr\u003e- You get to name characters and vote on new projects\u003cbr\u003e- You get to see new covers and blurbs first\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e- You\u0027ll get the finished audiobooks (this is limited to the number of audiobooks I get to give away)\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027ll add you to the \"thank you\" section of the books you\u0027ve supported\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027ll dedicate a story/book to you\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027ll be available for monthly Q\u0026amp;As (interactive video chat)\u003cbr\u003e- I\u0027ll read the tarot, make candles/soap, or post stationery (all shipping globally)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e[This list may expand with swag tiers, once swag become available, ie once I decide what I want to make; another option is to add workshops/creative mentorships]\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
