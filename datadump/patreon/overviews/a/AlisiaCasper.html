I want to communicate with the other humans and give some truth, joy \u0026amp; hope... and of course there\u0027ll be some fellow-sadness-feelings in order to say YOU ARE NOT ALONE!- or... WE ARE ALL ALONE!- TOGETHER! I have a Chronic Health Condition that limits my interaction with, \u0026amp; gorgeously destroys any chance of conforming to, The Standard Outside World Society Status Levels (it can get quite hermitty). My Darling Chronic has given me far, far more than it has taken- all it took was Then and all it gives is Now. It also gives me insane Chronic Migraines that affect my Cognition, hence the Special Poetic Nonsense Writing- ah yeah! Life is strange and beautiful and very hard; bright soft heavy red up down deep green. I travel better the struggly bits \u0026amp; celebrate more vividly the clearings by create-make-doing. I believe what I make is worth your time \u0026amp; attention- I put all I have into everything I create and I want you to share-feel-enjoy it! Unfortunately there\u0027s this weird notion that Money Is Life going around at the moment, and oh my goodness I want to LIVE! So if you can, please contribute to my living. I will share such Interesting Things for your eye-mind-soul-brains to feed on! \u003cbr\u003eLove, Respect, \u0026amp; Thank You Thank You Thank You for your time \u0026amp; attention.\u003c/div\u003e"
