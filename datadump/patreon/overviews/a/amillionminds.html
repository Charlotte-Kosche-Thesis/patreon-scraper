    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eWelcome to my page! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Melanie, and my mission is to improve mental health around the world, through a unique type of education starting in the early teen years. Teaching kids how to properly care for their minds, just like they care for their bodies, brush their teeth, etc. They will be given tools to improve not only their mental health but also to use their own inner resources to optimize their life on multiple levels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the rise in rates of suicide, mass shootings, opiate addiction, depression, and other tragic statistics, mental health is at the core of many of the problems we face as a society. I want to do my part to try to turn that around.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I teach should be taught in schools, but unfortunately, it is not. \u003cstrong\u003eMental Hygiene\u003c/strong\u003e is more important than ever, and we are not informed enough as kids about how our minds work, how to care for them, and how to recognize and troubleshoot when things go wrong. Things like anxiety, stress, depression, negativity, lack of motivation, self-esteem issues, learning challenges, pressure, overwhelm, conflicts, etc. Many of the things most adults struggled through in their teen years, before the added pressure of social media and other changes that now amplify the issues teens face. Knowing how to combat and prevent the effects early, can mean an entirely different experience of growing up and building a healthier society.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been studying the mind, neuroscience, psychology, physiology, neuroplasticity and all things mind-related for years and there have been incredible scientific breakthroughs in just this past decade. What I have found is that there are many simple tools that can help reduce the effects of trauma, anxiety, depression, panic attacks, etc. that do not require drugs or years on a therapist\u0027s couch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI teach kids how their minds work and to discover and optimize their core competencies, tackle obstacles, create change, improve relationships, attain success in the areas they choose and experience a much higher quality of life. One in which they are more in control of their emotions, reactions, energy levels and overall well-being. To stay on the right path when they are tempted by shiny objects, peer pressure, or fear, to veer off in destructive directions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSimply by understanding the funny tricks our hormones, neurochemicals and evolutionary survival mechanisms can play on us...and the motivations our brains are basing our decision-making on, can make all the difference in kids making better choices. And it can also help adults get \"un\u0027stuck.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this knowledge, I hope to empower kids to reach their full potential, excel in all areas of their lives, improve their relationships, and better understand one another. They, in turn, can interact more positively with the world around them, thus extending to families, neighborhoods and the global community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s help kids to become a feel-good success story and not another tragic statistic. By teaching them how to thrive.\u00a0This is my small part in leaving the planet better than I found it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I to Teach This?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a Bachelor of Science in Business, and I am a Certified Hypnotherapist and NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) Practitioner with many advanced certifications. I am also a Peak Performance Coach and writer. More important than any of that, I study all things mind-related and break them down age-appropriately for kids to learn to understand their minds and how to work with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a Mom. I have raised one child (21 now) and hosted 15 teenage foreign exchange students from all over the world, who I have periodically tested my material on. I have always been a good listener and I communicate well with teens. Mostly by listening more than I speak, seeing things from their perspective, and never talking down to them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are many things teens won\u0027t listen to their parents about (my daughter included) so I try to come in as an unbiased third party with simple, interesting and fun facts they may not be aware of. Sometimes it takes an outside source to get the information to sink in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t involve religion or politics, or teach anything controversial. I have no agenda other than helping kids to become better, healthier and happier human beings and citizens. Adults gain as much value from my content as teens do, sometimes more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e     \u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Teens?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe reason I chose to address teens, is they are the most at-risk. They are living in a world where self-esteem is at an all-time low and suicide, depression and anxiety at an all-time high. They need some guidance...a lifeline. The Personal Performance strategies within the curriculum I have written, are no different from those I teach my adult Peak Performance clients, but delivered in a language that kids are more open to. Simple as that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see teenagers as a \"lump of clay\" being molded into our future generation of adults. Each one of them has within them a fine work of art waiting to reveal itself to the world. We as former teens, need to help guide them as they chip away the bad parts and recognize and retain the beauty that lies within them. Continually improving, continually uncovering their own unique gifts. No one is given a manual for this, and many struggle to find their way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eWhy Do I Need Your Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eI have been working on this project for several years. In the beginning, I did it while working in commercial real estate, and then it ended up taking more and more of my time. More than my full-time job. It also involved continuing education (to do it right) which was also very time-consuming and costly. \u00a0And I still need to eat and pay for luxuries like gasoline and electricity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSelf-funding is just no longer sustainable. This labor of love has left me deeply in debt, but I am not one to ever ask for help. Ironically one of the lessons I teach teens - to ask for help when they need it. I guess that makes me the cobbler whose kids go barefoot (is that how the saying goes?).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have so thoroughly immersed myself in this work that I ignored and actually compromised my own health. It was at that point that I finally realized I need to reach out for some help. So I am running on caffeine and blind faith, but I keep moving forward. I know in my heart that if I save one kid from harming themselves or others, or keep one family from seeing their teen suffer through depression, addiction or even a lack of motivation to live their life fully...this will all have been worth it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e My Plan to Reach One Million Minds: \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to use my knowledge to help parents, teachers, coaches, mentors, and families to raise one million healthy, strong, responsible and capable adults. And to teach people of all ages to live intentionally. The lessons I have gathered are made to be shared, with children and adults alike. I chose one million because putting a number on it creates a benchmark for success. I expect that when people see the results, it will spread organically from there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a monumental project for one person, and in order to be successful, I need to be able to devote the proper amount of time to it. So I am asking for your support. I place enormous value on your contribution - even reading this ridiculously long page. So thank you in advance, whether you become a Patron or not, you have already given me some of your valuable time and for that, I am truly grateful. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also hope that after calling this to your attention, perhaps the next time you are speaking with a teenager, you will take a little extra time to really \"see\" them, look past the \"I am fine\" mask and see their struggles. I have yet to meet one who has none. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Sampling of The Content in the Curriculum:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Best Version of You\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMindfulness and Meditation\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLearning How To Learn\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFailure and Feedback\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eKnowing and Realizing Your Full Potential\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnderstanding the Forces That Drive Us\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eNeurotransmitters and How They Work\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCombatting External and Internal Negativity\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHormones and Neurochemicals\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to Build Great Habits and Eliminate Bad Ones\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePeer Pressure\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eGetting Out of Fight-Flight\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUnderstanding Cortisol and Adrenaline\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEFT - Tapping\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTechnology, Media, Advertising and Motives\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMind Over Matter\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHandling Breakups, Rejection, and Disappointment\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eComparing Your Life to Photoshop\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBuilding a Fluid Gameplan For Life\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLimiting Beliefs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEstablishing Your Mental Game\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDealing with Trauma: Past, Present, and Future.
