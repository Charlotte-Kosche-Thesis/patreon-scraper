No, I can\u0027t). \u00a0At the same time, comic books like Tintin and the Flash, great animated films from Disney, Dreamworks and Don Bluth came into my life and cemented a love of visual art and I knew I had to spend my life using it to tell stories of smarmy swashbucklers in exotic lands. \u00a0With your support I will tell stories of new adventurers through the mediums of web comics and illustrated books, doing my part to keep old school high adventure alive. \u00a0Funding will help to buy supplies and allow me to dedicate more time to research, writing, and drawing to create the best stories and art possible. \u00a0Also, in the case of my comic pages, funding will help to pay my colorist for her wonderful help. \u00a0And eventually, as chapters are completed, it will allow me to release hard trade copies of the stories to be sold online and at comic book conventions."
