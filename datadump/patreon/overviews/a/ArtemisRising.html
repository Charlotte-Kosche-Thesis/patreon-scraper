She also didn\u0027t know that meeting him would result in losing nearly everything and having to start all over... She wished Finley Kekoa didn\u0027t look so good in superhero tights, or if he had to be that ridiculously attractive, he wouldn\u0027t flaunt himself all over town on giant movie posters. He was bad luck and bad news; All the sweaty, tingly dreams in the world wouldn\u0027t change that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been a story teller. As a child, I would tell off-the-cuff original stories to entertain and frighten my siblings. Now I tell my stories to my three wildly imaginative children. As soon as I could write, I was writing poetry and fiction, as well as expressing myself through all sorts of art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you read a great book, you love and hate and live and die with the characters; They become a part of you. For me, writing is a process of synergism--a mind-meld with the reader, and a deep communication with the world. We all have stories inside of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write because I love to tell stories. I will always try to find time to write, even as a single, low income mom with a lot on her plate. I hope you can find one or more of my stories engaging.\u00a0Come join me, and read!\u003cbr\u003e"
