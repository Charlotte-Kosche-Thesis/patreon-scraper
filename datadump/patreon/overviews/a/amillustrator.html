    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eStory\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m Anthony Miller Jr. and I\u2019m creating \u003cstrong\u003egodplex\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(with a big, lowercase g). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003egodplex\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0is a story about a black man dealing with the consequences of omnipotence. Isaiah Malachi Jones gains near infinite psychic power, nearly costing him his humanity. He spends his days trying to answer EVERY prayer and save EVERYone. But he\u2019s only one man. All the while machinations develop behind the scenes to control and destroy him. It\u2019s a psychological, soft sci-fi drama dealing with loss of faith, corruption, greed, and hope. Plus a pew pew energy battle at the end because comics (s/o\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrailerDrake/\"\u003eDrake McWhorter\u003c/a\u003e, support his Patreon too).\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to complete my story and begin making more. \u003cstrong\u003egodplex\u003c/strong\u003e will be a 5 chapter graphic novel Watchmen style (as far as the 9 panel grid structure goes). I want to deliver the best possible tale I can, be genuine from the text to the art to your eyes and ears. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eDid I mention that a soundtrack EP would accompany the story? Oh I make music too.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy penultimate goal in life is to tell stories. Whether comics, children\u2019s books, cartoons, or musically, I just want to make art that tells stories. Since graduating Pratt, I\u2019ve been homeless, worked various odd jobs, done numerous commissions, and still fought to \u003cem\u003e\u003cu\u003ebe able to\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/em\u003e create my own work. I\u2019m turning to Patreon to help forge my path and enter the storytelling industry with you, willing patron. I hope by sharing the journey with you all, I can begin building a solid foundation for my career, and deliver quality books to the best of my ability. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your contribution. Thank you for your support. Thank you for just visiting this profile even if you are unable to be a patron now. I cannot wait to give you \u003cstrong\u003egodplex\u003c/strong\u003e completed and the Pendr\u00e4gon trilogy and the Maximus Drake Jr. series and...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh best believe there is a wealth of stories to tell.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
