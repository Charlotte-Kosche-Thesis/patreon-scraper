    "summary": "(QUICK LINKS):\u003cbr\u003eMy PUT game site is \u003ca href=\"https://ivanaedler.github.io/MIMPUT/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003eMy Wonderful Sonja game is still in design phase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIntroduction\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   Hello there! I am Ivan Aedler. I have been developing Flash games since 2011. I\u0027ve been programming since 2007 (I am a Computer Scientist), but I work more in Java and with research texts about algorithms and JSF projects. One of my passions is to be able to create Flash or HTML5 demos/galleries and 3D art, but my goal is to create \u0027huge non-linear online games\u0027. That is, games you can hover around and do many things. Be it an E+ game or Adult ones.\u003cbr\u003e   I live in South America. I love my country, mostly the nature, which refreshes me in order to continue making new content. I like to walk, jog, ride a bicycle, and I don\u0027t have a car.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   For my projects, I have developed PUT (Peach\u0027s Untold tale), a freeware parody adult game with a focus on tons of levels and scenes, and given endless and free support. I am always updating PUT, sometimes every day, provided I am alive and well, of course. :D This version of the game was first started on April 2012 as an alternate version of another game (Playshapes\u0027 Mario is Missing), and many contributors helped with art, vector animations and scripts. It was (and still is!) a rough road, as I\u0027ve had to do the hardest parts alone or rely on volunteers (well, its an indie game).\u003cbr\u003e   Many people praised me and many helped me, including a number of great artists. The game is now in AS3 (it was in AS2 until last year), which is great because AS3 is faster and class-based!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   The PUT game I deploy is in my \u003ca href=\"https://ivanaedler.github.io/MIMPUT/index.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGITHUB site\u003c/a\u003e (with tons of info about the game) and in \u003ca href=\"https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34\u0026amp;t=2265\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eLOK site\u003c/a\u003e (Legend of Krystal forums), where I partipate a lot, getting suggestions and chit chatting about the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know we can go further. We can make the utmost dream of a full game with all levels and hundreds of scenes. Yes, hundreds.\u003cbr\u003eIn order to accelerate its development, making me more dedicated to the game, I have to rely on people that enjoy my content enough to support my work. Sometimes I have restless nights figuring out how to fix that annoying bug you are having, or to add a feature to Princess Peach. Sometimes I don\u0027t even have coffee in order to make me focused.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   With Patreon, you pledge a small amount of money each time I do a major project update to directly support me for all of my efforts. This allows me to continue working on and updating the projects I think my fans will love the most. Keep in mind that you can set a monthly limit, pledge anonymously, or cancel your pledge anytime you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   I plan on making a wall of top-features the game should have, and also add user-requested features, provided we do a kind of voting system with things the players want so when I implement it as many of you can enjoy it as possible. ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   All of these games (currently PUT is active, and Wonderful Sonja is in the plans) are free to play at any time. By becoming a Patron you are directly supporting the development of projects like these and new projects in the future. As a Patron, if you want to see a particular project be revisited or updated you can vote for it. I\u0027ll be keeping an ear open to all of my supporters to see what they want me to focus on. Keep in mind that you can donate anonymously in case of privacy concerns!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGames currently in development:\u003cbr\u003e- MIM - Peach\u0027s Untold Tale (Adult)\u003cbr\u003e- Wonderful Sonja (Based on Wonderful Pink) - CONCEPTUAL STAGE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGames I started but put on hold:\u003cbr\u003e- Magical Tree remake (from Konami)\u003cbr\u003e- Krystal AE (based on Krystal G by GoRepeat) - it\u0027s on hold because PUT is the top priority.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGames I would like to make (parodies):\u003cbr\u003e- Alice in Wonderland (Adult)\u003cbr\u003e- Cute Peach - based on Paper Mario II (Adult)\u003cbr\u003e- Toe Jam \u0026amp; Earl (Adult)\u003cbr\u003e- Jasmine\u0027s: an Embarrassed adventure - from Aladdin (Adult)\u003cbr\u003e- Atomic Betty game (Adult)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e   PUT is the current priority. It\u0027s playable, and it is actively being updated and worked on. I usually post updates (sometimes every day) in the LOK forums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent PUT Team:\u003cbr\u003e- Ivan Aedler (coder, 3d artist, scripter, music remaker, animator, model creation)\u003cbr\u003e- Contributor: Blargh (Koopaling scenes, animation and model creation)\u003cbr\u003e- Contributor: Soren (Coder)\u003cbr\u003e- Contributor: TripFlip (Artist)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Plan:\u003cbr\u003e   I do almost everything in my flash projects by myself, designing and planning the project, drawing the artwork, doing the animation, music (mostly a .MID remake by me, or the usage of older songs), programming and so on.\u003cbr\u003e   Most of the funds I receive from supporters will be directly invested in the game updates, some with life support (food, coffee), server and energy bills (I use 2 PCs and I have a backup system in order to always work with the latest version), paid plugins the game could have, provided patrons want it (in the future, when one of more of those games are in Unity, I plan having a SVG vector plugin, so the games will be smooth instead of pixelated in zoom ins) and paying others to help me make huge projects, more than just simple games and animations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayment Disclaimer:\u003cbr\u003e   Pledge proceeds do not go toward any individual project. When you make a pledge you are donating directly to me, Ivan Aedler.\u003cbr\u003e   By being a Patron you are allowing me to focus on creating content I think my fans will enjoy the most instead of needing to take commissions or bother with miscellaneous distractions.\u003cbr\u003e   This money is not used to fund any specific projects (for copyright reasons) although I -will- use it to pay voice actors, artists, other animators and musicians to help improve the quality of my projects and allow for bigger things.\u003cbr\u003e   I will be making at least 1 update per WEEK, with or without posting a new feature (like an update with bug fixes), because even if I do not release something I am still actively working on my projects regardless. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, you can:\u003cbr\u003e  Cancel or change your pledge amount at any time.\u003cbr\u003e  Set a monthly limit so you don\u0027t pledge over your budget.\u003cbr\u003e  Pledge anonymously, for privacy reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wholeheartedly say THANKS!! I appreciate your help in order to make content you can truly love!\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank you! I wish you a long and great life!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Ivan Aedler"
