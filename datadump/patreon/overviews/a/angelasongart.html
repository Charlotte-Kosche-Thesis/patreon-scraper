    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003e Hello! My name is Angela Song, and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m an illustrator and storyteller, and my goal is to make people smile and laugh. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThe Short and Sweet Story:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor several years I have worked as a freelance illustrator, gaining clients with big fancy names as well as clients who happened to find me on social media and were tickled by my art. I have been dedicated to molding my illustration and storytelling skills through my work and particularly through my personal Daily Drawing project: one panel story illustrations I post on social media every day without fail since February 2012.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n But behind the scenes I have tons of ideas constantly brewing: \n\u003cstrong\u003estories both epic and quirky, goofy and thoughtful, children\u0027s books and adventure-filled comic pages\u003c/strong\u003e, that I delegated to the \"someday\" pile due to the need of getting by day to day. A week doesn\u0027t go by where I don\u0027t scribble new ideas and stories down feverishly at 4 AM, resigned to the thought that it will be started \"someday\". Well, I have decided to take the plunge and make \"someday\" start today. \u003cstrong\u003eThe goal of my Patreon is to fund my art and bring these stories to life and to share them with the world\u003c/strong\u003e, and as a Patron you would help me make it happen! With your support I will be able to pay for art supplies, keep my lights on (and also keep a home in which those lights come in real handy), and have the ability to dedicate my time to these projects so I can share them with you all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow this works:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNow, I certainly don\u0027t expect people to make it rain just so I can swim \naround in a Scrooge McDuck vault full of your money. If you like my work\n and want to support, you can \n\u003cstrong\u003echoose how much you wish to pledge every month\u003c/strong\u003e, with no long-term commitment type deal, and the ability to edit or cancel your pledge at any time. Your pledges will go directly into me-creating-for-you time, and you will receive rewards depending on which tier you select (and my undying gratitude for any tier!). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat stories are you working on?\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis Patreon thing isn\u0027t about just one story: this is about all the stories and projects I have dying to burst out. Some I have planned would be an ongoing series while others are more in the line of a Children\u0027s Illustrated book, and as such has a shorter story line.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile all projects will be available to view for the public on my website, Patrons with access to the Backstage Blog will get to see pages before they are posted publicly as well as exclusive work in progress images, concept illustrations, and behind the scenes commentary. You will be able to see the project come to life! Not to mention the goodies you get from time to time. :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of the story, every project will be compiled into e-books and hopefully, depending on the funds, into physical copies!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRewards will also be based on the projects in progress. Once they are completed, I will update the page to reflect the next project, and rewards will reflect the theme of that project until completion, and so on. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs we hit more milestones I will be able to devote more time on these projects and therefore release more pages more frequently, and I also will be increasing the goodies my Patrons receive because dang it, you guys are awesome!\nI\u0027d love feedback on what YOU would like to see as rewards and milestones as well, and I will tweak things accordingly. After all, this will all be made possible thanks to you. :)\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can keep up with updates through my \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/angelasongart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/angelasongart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.angelasongart.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitter.com/angelasongart\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.angelasongart.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e, and get some fun art with your Patron discount at my \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.angelasongart.etsy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.angelasongart.storenvy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eStorenvy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e shops!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s gonna be a crazy ride, but I\u0027m game if you are.
