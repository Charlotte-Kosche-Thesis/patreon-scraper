I am a freelance writer, a performer of stand-up comedy, storytelling and feminist rants/raves, an educator and unapologetic feminist.\u00a0My work aims to connect with audiences who want to learn more about gender, feminism and women\u0027s issues in ways that are personal, relatable and entertaining. I am a champion of women and girls and my feminism is all about amplifying women\u0027s voices and creating platforms for them to share their stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI live in Chicago where I host live events and I also am an adjunct professor of Gender, Media \u0026amp; Pop Culture at one of the City Colleges. I love movies, television, music, and lots of other things that I reflect on with a critical, feminist eye. The goal of this Patreon is to create new ways to share the work that I do with a wider audience and on platforms outside of brick \u0026amp; mortar, IRL gatherings. With every increment donation, I\u0027ll create new content in addition to share exclusive extras from live shows and events just for my Patreon supporters."
