Most importantly, we wouldn\u0027t be And You without YOU! We are most famous for our mash ups of different movies and TV shows. Some of our fan favorites are Diary of a Wimpy Kid meets Alien and Game of Thrones meets Minions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnjoy \"Diary of a Wimpy Alien!\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TuYWtrkHEb4\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also check out our YouTube Channel\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/andyoufilms\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also produce full-length feature films! Our first feature, FLASHBACK, is a science fiction, action-adventure, comedy that was made entirely on green screen. To our surprise, it was even represented at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012 and seen on both HBO and Cinemax! Our second feature film, BUBBA THE REDNECK WEREWOLF (co-produced with Two Rubbing Nickels), is a horror comedy based off of the comic book series from the 90s. BUBBA can now be went to the 2017 Cannes Film Festival and can now be streamed on Hulu!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eWhat we are very excited about is our newest feature soon to be completed this fall, GOTTA KILL \u2018EM ALL, a horror movie based off of Pokemon Go!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eHere at And You, our goal is to make creative content on a regular basis for our fans, but we are always striving for bigger and better things! We wish filmmaking would be free for us but it actually costs a lot of money (who would have thought?) That\u0027s where you can help us! It\u0027s a very small group of us that produces these videos from start to finish and any bit would help. We could even start making videos more often for you guys if we had the funds! We would love to be able to spend more on actors, props, locations, set pieces, costumes, etc. to bring YOU the best entertainment possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for visiting And You Films and for your support! We look forward to getting to know YOU. It\u0027s because of people like you that help us continue our journey as filmmakers. That\u0027s why we are AND YOU FILMS. Because without YOU, we would just be the \"AND\" - and that\u0027s not nearly as much fun!\u003cbr\u003e"
