    "summary": "Every month since November 2013, I have produced an original, one-page logic puzzle (or \u201c\u00e6nigma\u201d) that\u0027s designed to yield a one-word answer.\u00a0 Aside from their well-earned joy of accomplishment, successful solvers also receive other rewards: they can use the correct answer to get a discount at the \u003ca href=\"http://www.pavelspuzzles.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePavel\u0027s Puzzles\u003c/a\u003e website, and they can be entered into a monthly random drawing for a \u003cem\u003efree physical puzzle\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.pavelspuzzles.com/aenigmas\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAdalogical \u00c6nigmas\u003c/a\u003e are unabashedly difficult, but fair: there is always a logical way to proceed (even if it\u0027s not always immediately evident) and it\u0027s never necessary to pursue a long, tedious, backtracking approach.\u00a0 At the bookstore/cafe in Seattle where the series originated, they typically printed 600-900 copies a month and got 25-75 solutions redeemed. Solvers justifiably take great pride in fighting their way through to a solution, and there\u0027s a brisk informal competition to be the first each month to do so.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a4/Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg/167px-Ada_Lovelace_portrait.jpg\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e\nStylistically, the puzzles are also charmingly presented.  Each one features a letter ostensibly written by Augusta Ada\u00a0King (1815-1852), Countess of Lovelace, daughter of poet Lord Byron, and oft-reputed first computer programmer.  She explains what inspired her to create that month\u0027s \u00e6nigma, what the rules are, and, once solved, how to extract the final answer.  Ada\u0027s personality shines through every month, and many solvers cite her writing style as one of the reasons the series is so addictive.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTo add just a little extra fun, almost every month the puzzle includes one or more \u201cEaster Eggs:\u201d short, thematic messages hidden either within the puzzle itself or elsewhere on the page.  There\u0027s a tiny number, enclosed in an egg shape, written in the lower-right corner of the page; that number (the only hint on the page that there \n\u003cem\u003eare\u003c/em\u003e Easter eggs) tells solvers how many eggs there are to find.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEarlier, I mentioned\u00a0that the Adalogical \u00c6nigma series was originally paid for by a Seattle bookstore.\u00a0 They eventually felt the need to\u00a0retarget those resources for other projects, leaving the\u00a0series without support.\u00a0 I am approaching other brick-and-mortar shops across the country, but\u00a0in the harsh realities of today\u0027s retail world, it is difficult for\u00a0most to afford\u00a0the licensing fees required\u00a0to make the \u00c6nigma\u0027s production economically viable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRegardless, I truly love Ada and her \u00e6nigmas, and I\u0027m\u00a0grateful to the many people who\u0027ve\u00a0told me how much they\u0027ve enjoyed solving these puzzles.\u00a0 I am therefore reaching out, via this wonderful Patreon platform, to solvers everywhere: please help keep this fun and rewarding tradition alive!\n\u003cimg src=\"http://www.pavelspuzzles.com/aenigmas/egg.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; float: right;\"\u003e"
