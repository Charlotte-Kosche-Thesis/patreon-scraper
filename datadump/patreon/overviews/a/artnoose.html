    "summary": "Hi. I\u0027m Artnoose, and I have been single-handedly letterpress printing the personal zine Ker-bloom! every other month since the summer of 1996. Yes, every other month, for twenty years. I have so far managed to avoid missing an issue or even being late. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, Ker-bloom! has become a life history, letterpress printed in installments. I have written about relationships, traveling, bicycles, reading groups, parenting, and playing rock music. I have always funded my own process by having day jobs, running my own letterpress business, and offering zine subscriptions. I am now bringing the opportunity to support my zine into the Patreon format. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of a traditional zine subscription, where you pay a fixed amount for one year\u0027s worth of zines, this is a way for you to sign up at any time and pay monthly until whenever you decide to stop. For the record, I intend to print Ker-bloom! as long as I physically can, so I hope your support is similarly steadfast. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll keep printing Ker-bloom! no matter what, as well as all the numerous other weird letterpress things I come up with. This way though, you get a crack at prints hot off the press, and you make the road just a little bit smoother for me. I thank you all in advance.\u003cbr\u003e"
