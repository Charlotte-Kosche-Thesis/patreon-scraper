I love to inspire others \u00a0..... And sometimes I\u0027m funny (-: \u00a0...I think ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this ?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis site is a Crowd funding platform where you can help support me as an independent artist and get FREE music and other exclusive stuff. Please read below for details!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it like Kickstarter?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, yes and no. With Kickstarter you pledge a one off amount for a project. With Patreon you give a an amount ( as small or as big as you like ) every month for on going songs , videos , and things the artists creates.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eYou don\u0027t pay anything until the song or whatever is created.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often will I put music out on here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs often as I can. My intention and aim is to create at least one new video and/or song a month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m using this site to be truly creative. So for a little as $1 a month you will be supporting me as a musician.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy pay me to create music?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work really hard at music , as a performer and as a creator of it , and if I make a difference in your life then my mission is accomplished. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me money buys me time. Time to create. So any contribution is greatly appreciated and in return I can create more music , music that I can give to you (-:\u003cbr\u003eAnd honestly I would rather you gave me a $1 a month than buy me a drink at a gig, or a coffee if we met.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was lucky to be given the gift of Music through my Mum and Dad and then through all the bands I fell in love with as I grew up.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt makes me happy to add some colour and harmony to your life through music and it\u0027s great that I can directly interact with someone that listens to my music and supports me as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0If I make a difference in your life then my mission is accomplished.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
