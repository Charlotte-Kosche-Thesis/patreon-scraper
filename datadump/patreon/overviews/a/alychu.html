With the formalities out of the way, I want to state clearly that pledging to this Patreon is \u003cstrong\u003ecompletely voluntary\u003c/strong\u003e! I\u0027ll still be updating my page and other sites, so do not feel pressured to pledge! Your pledges are appreciated, but by no means enforced! \u2665 Now then, let\u0027s get down to the real fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho - or what - is Alychu?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAlychu is synonymous with the words, \u0027weeb,\u0027 \u0027cosplayer,\u0027 \u0027pin-up model,\u0027 \u0027gamer,\u0027 \u0027lewd,\u0027 \u0027dork.\u0027 I\u0027m just a girl in Florida who tries her best\u2122 every single day! I try my best to be as real and as honest as possible to my friends and followers. What you see is what you get! I aspire to inspire, and my goal is to give a voice to others who may be too afraid to speak up, and to channel self-love and positivity to others in - and out - of these communities. Did I mention I can get really lewd?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut Aly - why should I become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eYou ask this question, and I will be honest. The only legitimate reason you should become a patron is if you enjoy the content on my other social media, and you want to see more! And I \u003cstrong\u003ewant\u003c/strong\u003e to give you more! As time goes on, I receive more and more requests to stream more, cosplay x character, shoot x thing... And as much as I would love to deliver, my real life and adult responsibilities come first. That isn\u0027t to say that cosplaying and modeling aren\u0027t my real life. On the contrary,\u003cem\u003e it\u0027s my whole life\u003c/em\u003e, \u00a0but being an adult sucks.With Patreon, and the love and support I receive from you guys, I would be able to bring out even more content! New cosplays, photoshoots, Twitch parties, maybe even a vlog? So much stuff! I think it\u0027s a win-win situation. \u2665\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, Aly, but what do I get out of this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it\u0027s only fair that I show my patrons more of me! So that means more exclusive content, just for you guys! Photoshoots specifically for my patrons, polaroids, monthly signed prints mailed to you! Even some random goodies! It\u0027s almost like a small club! You get to be in the know on what I\u0027m doing! See my cosplay lineup before I put them on any other social media! Hang out with me at a convention and do some shots! Play some Overwatch or Final Fantasy with me? I hope you\u0027re as excited as I am!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlright. One last thing, though: what does this mean for Alychu?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCosplaying, modeling, and using my artistic skills is my life\u0027s work. I find myself the most at peace when I\u0027m working on my talents. Due to the stress from my real life, I find I\u0027m not often able to practice my craft, and at the same time, reach my happy place. You all love seeing what I do, and that makes me the happiest girl out there! I just wish that I could do it more, and with Patreon, that dream slowly starts to become reality, almost like a real life Final Fantasy. You want entertainment, and art, and I am more than happy to do it for you all. This means that we\u0027re only going up from here, adventurers. Will you join me on this journey? \u2665"

Cosplaying opened up a whole new world for me, with all sorts of opportunities and allowed me to meet some really great people. I\u0027m making this Patreon in order to further my goals, help me be able to reach a wider audience, and to be able to have the resources to get more things done and make sure they are of a higher quality. I want to spread a message of positivity throughout the community and by being able to get a wider spread audience, I feel that it will be easier to accomplish that, as well as being able to spread my own work and artistic endeavors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of cosplay endeavors, I also want to start doing cosplay makeup tutorials, general makeup tutorials, and let\u0027s plays on YouTube. The funds from this Patreon will allow me to get better equipment and software in order to be able to effectively create this videos and make them look clean and polished, as well as allow for a general production values and the purchase of new makeup supplies.",
