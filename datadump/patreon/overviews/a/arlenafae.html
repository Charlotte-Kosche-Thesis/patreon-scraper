You\u0027re basically subscribing to some of your favorite creators in order to receive a variety of rewards for your support each month--whether it be early access, exclusive digital files or psychical goods.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are You Supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to become a patron, you\u0027ll be supporting my content--cosplay, photography, templates and tutorials! Your support allows me to create new costumes, cosplay photography and videos revolving around this passion! Creating such content is extremely time-consuming and takes away from other aspects in life (i.e. work). Support from patrons allows me to dedicate more time to the craft. With your continued help I\u0027ll be able to create better quality content and more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is My Goal?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eMy goal is to be able to complete at least one large build a month and release all videos around that build within the same month. At the moment I am a one-woman-show! I take all my cosplay photos, do all the photo editing, do all the video recording and editing, do all the wig and makeup styling and, of course, create all the costumes! Unless I\u0027m purchasing a small, fun cosplay or having a friend acting as my tripod for public shoots, I receive 0 outside help! With an average of 10-20 photos per shoot and several videos for each cosplay to edit, things can get stock-piled real quick! As my support on Patreon grows and I\u0027m able to dedicate more time to it, all the things previously listed will seem much less overwhelming!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know that creating a cosplay can be really intimidating sometimes and put one off from attempting to cosplay a character they love. That\u0027s why creating content that can help others learn and create their own cosplays is actually really important to me. Some of the best comments are ones telling me how much my videos or templates have helped them! I plan\u00a0to better the quality of my tutorials and create more of them. I want to be able to make easy-to-follow tutorials and well-filmed work logs in order to help fellow cosplayers out when they\u0027re crafting their own cosplays. My goal is to be able to release at least 2 videos a week on my YouTube channel. Given, not every video will be about cosplay since I do enjoy the occasional makeup tutorial, haul or fashion-related videos--but a majority of the videos will be cosplay driven.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/8v5U54W.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eWhat am I Working On?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy cosplay goals tend to change as I discover new characters and companies such as Riot Games and Blizzard continue to release new characters and skins!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrently my large/main cosplay goals are:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eChampionship Shyvana from League of Legends\u003cbr\u003eFight Card from Card Captor Sakura\u003cbr\u003eHarley Quinn from Injustice: Gods Among Us\u003cbr\u003eLightning from Final Fantasy 13-2\u003cbr\u003ePurple Heart from Hyperdimension Neptunia\u003cbr\u003eTrapping Ranger Rena from Elsword\u003cbr\u003eTyrande from Heroes of the Storm\u003cbr\u003eXayah from League of Legends\u003cbr\u003eMechanic Brigitte from Overwatch\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Dream Cosplay is:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eZagara from Heroes of the Storm\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/M0xK4p3.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eRewards\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHiRes/HD Photo\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDetailed Write-Up Tutorials\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eExclusive Videos and Work-in-Progress photos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFan Signs\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePrintable Templates/Patterns\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCosplay Prints\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBoudoir Photos and Prints\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOne-of-a-Kind Cosplay Polaroids\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Y6tX0HK.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDisclaimers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003ePlease do not feel obligated or pressured to pledge.
