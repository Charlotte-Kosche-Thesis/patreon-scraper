I made a Patreon when my channel was growing static and not experiencing much growth. Since then, my channel has more than doubled in size. I was debating on deleting this, but my YouTube MCN (the middle man who is supposed to pay you) has been rocky and hasn\u0027t paid me in three months and I even had more problems with them before then. Even though I should be financially independent, my network who has me in a lock in contract has been a constant bump in the road.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI should be leaving the network soon, but my point is that life is unexpected and it\u0027s very hard to rely on companies. The patrons who donated actually made these past six months livable, despite it being the biggest growth of my channel. So thank you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter this is all resolved, I\u0027ll keep my Patreon up as a virtual tip jar, if you will. I have hired Deezus (@deezus_walks) and Dad as Heck (@dad_as_heck) to help me out with editing here and there, so it helps me pay them as well as rent on the office!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate you all so much and I\u0027m very grateful for this. Thank you all. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e"
