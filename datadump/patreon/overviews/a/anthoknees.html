First of all: thank you for even considering becoming a patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s the tl;dr version*\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI do a lot of intellectual and emotional labor for free, particularly online. I want to keep it free. However, I know many folks who have the means to contribute $50/month, $5/month, or even $1/month for the labor it takes me to make the knowledge accessible for those with internet connections. That\u0027s all I\u0027m asking for: compensation for labor. You can cancel at any time :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eBesides paying for labor, what do Patrons get?\u003c/h3\u003eI tweet daily and produce essays rooted in criticism and analysis at least two times a month, if not once a week.

I often write analysis and criticism rooted in my own lived experience as well as my own studies, both formal and informal. Much of the knowledge I learned came from folks like my mother, friends I know in person, women of color I\u0027ve never met, femmes I\u0027ve never met, non-binary and trans folks I\u0027ve never met, things I read, and books on books on books on books. In an effort to pass on that knowledge and be publicly accountable for the mistakes I make, I often bypass approaching a publisher and just publish it for free online. This occurs through a series of tweets on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/anthoknees\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e or 800-2,500 word pieces on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@anthoknees\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e, but also occurs in different forms.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd since we are dealing with money, transparency is important. I\u0027m currently a fulltime student in a PhD program. They don\u0027t pay us a lot, I have family, I deal with student loans, I live\u00a0in Los Angeles, and I also have this not-so-fun combination of depression and anxiety.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome folks love me and some folks hate me, but it doesn\u0027t change the fact that both traditional and non-traditional students have told me they\u0027ve learned more about sociology from me (\u003ca href=\"https://campus.about.me/2016/02/04/untraditional-college-path/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eand the 9 damn years it took me to finish undergrad\u003c/a\u003e) than they did their professors.
