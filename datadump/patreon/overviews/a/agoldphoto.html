    "summary": "I am a Pet Photographer on a mission! I started taking pet adoption photos back in April, 2016. I volunteered on the weekends at Humane Society Tampa Bay helping their adoptable animals get a better photo to increase their chances at adoption. A few months in, they asked if I would host a Pet Photo Shoot Fundraiser to raise money for the shelter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePet owners bring their pets in for a photo shoot with a portion of the proceeds going to various animal shelters, charities and rescues. We have hosted over 150 events and have donated over $65,000 since July, 2016.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosting Pet Photo Shoot Fundraisers have allowed me to quit my corporate job and since May, 2017, I have been a full-time pet photographer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have relied on the income from those events to afford life\u0027s basic needs, but I want to spend more time taking photos of shelter animals to increase their chances adoption, but I need some help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA small monthly gift will help me be able to spend more time volunteering at shelters. A portion of it will also go towards boosting the posts on Facebook to reach more people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe recently volunteered at Suncoast Animal League and took photos of Hunter the Rhodesian Ridgeback. He had been at the shelter for 3 weeks. We took his photos on a Monday and when the shelter opened again on Wednesday, someone rushed to the shelter to adopt him.\u00a0He saw our\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/agoldphotos/posts/1950180991962635\"\u003eFacebook post\u003c/a\u003e and also recently lost his Ridgeback.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, we\u0027ll be able to help more dogs like Hunter find a new home.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am a Pet Photographer on a mission. I started the Pit Bull Picture Project in August of 2016 with a goal of showing off their goofy and lovable side to inspire more Pit Bull adoptions. When asked how many Pit Bulls I have helped get adopted, I honestly don\u0027t know. I haven\u0027t had an easy way of keeping track. Well, now I do.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Pit Bull Picture Project has been featured in Huffington Post, People Magazine, UpWorthy, a gallery in Pottery Barn, My Vets office and hopefully even more places!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I travel, not only around Florida, but around the country to take photos of Pit Bulls, I\u0027d like to sponsor Pit Bull adoptions as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to sponsor and inspire at least 25 Pit Bull Adoptions within 365 days. Your monthly contribution will help with costs associated with travel, but it will also help fund a Pit Bull adoption after one of my Photography sessions at a shelter.\u00a0",
