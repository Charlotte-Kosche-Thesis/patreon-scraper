Most likely, you know me from my YouTube channel where I upload gameplays of a large\u00a0variety\u00a0of games. If you\u0027ve just found this Patreon page by chance then head on over to my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/c/knightgamerrex\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube Page\u003c/a\u003e right now to check out what I do!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027ve Chosen Patreon...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like to begin by thanking you all for your unending support. As some of you may know, I\u0027ve been uploading gameplays to YouTube for a few years now. As time has progressed, it has become more of something I\u0027d like to do full-time rather than a hobby.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a place where you can, generously, donate to the channel and choose a reward for doing so! Not only are you helping out with expenses of keeping the channel going, but you are also receiving something for yourself in return! Along with that, there are Patreon goals set to keep the channel running. With each goal that is met, it means we are closer to achieving a full-time commitment to the channel together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf there are any questions as to why to support the channel and I, that aren\u0027t currently answered, then please feel free to message me or leave a comment! Sooner or later, I\u0027ll be able to start streaming with enough income! This way you will be able to ask me questions or interact with me directly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Your Donations Will Be Paying For...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery penny received from all of you will go towards keeping the channel going! Not only will you help pay for new games and equipment, but you will also help me afford better internet and rent!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Games -\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Each year, new and better games are released to us. With your help, I will be able to afford all the games that you request and want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNew Equipment - \u003c/strong\u003eNot only do new games cost money, but some even require better computer hardware. Also, I\u0027d be able to afford better recording equipment to make the viewing experience far better!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eInternet - \u003c/strong\u003eMy current internet is more than just slow. It\u0027s impossible for me to live stream and hard to upload multiple videos at a time. Your donations will help bring more content to the channel and even allow all of you to speak with me directly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther Expenses - \u003c/strong\u003eIf I am wanting to start making videos full-time, I\u0027m going to need to move out of my parents house and into my own place. Not having to worry about working a second job to pay rent will allow me to stream and make higher quality videos for you to watch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You So Much!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn conclusion, thank you all so much for your support!
