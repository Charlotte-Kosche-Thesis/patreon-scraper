    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHey there! \u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for doing this \u003cstrong\u003etogether with us!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0With your support we are speeding up the process in creating a vegan world and animal liberation! We are here to find, support and motivate vegans to be (more) active by participating and organising events. Join us on our journey throughout 28 countries in Eastern Europe to raise awareness by setting up chapters for 3 worldwide organisations \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho are we?\u003cbr\u003eWe are Ruth and Shivonne and fresh new motivated vegan activists. Last year we met each other at a pig slaughterhouse where we looked into the eyes of these innocent beautiful beings before they were sent to death. We both felt this strong need to do more for them and we both felt the need to speak up louder for them. We really wanted more activists to join us to be a stronger voice for them. So we decided to work together and make a plan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow did we get here?\u003cbr\u003eWe joined the most effective organisations. We travelled through the Netherlands to hold workshops about activism and combined this with organising events with these organisations. This way people could try out different kinds of activism and really connect with each other. We wanted to inspire and build up a strong community and find organisers for these 3 organisations. It was a succes! We helped start up 7 new AV chapters, 4 new Save-groups, and much more. We decided to pick up Shivonne\u0027s van in Oslo and made it into our home for the next 6 months.\u003cbr\u003eNow we are ready to cross some borders!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thesavemovement.org/\"\u003eThe Save Movement\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring weekdays you find us along the country side where we stop trucks to bear witness and comfort animals on their way to slaughter. The animals are often very scared, hungry and thirsty.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe notice that they appreciate having our attention. We take footage of them and post it on social media which reaches a lot of people. This way people can look these victims in the eyes and make the connection to where their food is coming from. This is so powerful that it really inspires to make that change. That is why we encourage everyone and help people start up their own chapter with The Save Movement\u003cstrong\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eOur aim is to have a Save group in every country in Europe as soon as possible!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/\"\u003eAnonymous for the Voiceless\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the weekends we move towards the bigger cities where share our experience and knowledge with the public. Our group stands in a cube formation with anonymous masks and hold laptops with footage that shows the suffering animals go trough in this society. This art installation makes people curious and come closer to watch the footage. They are often shocked and also very open to talk about the industry and about their food choices. We then ask them to take Challenge22 to help them go vegan. Chapters of Anonymous for the Voiceless\u00a0are popping up all throughout Europe since 2016. We want to speed up this process and help people start up Cube of Truth in their own city.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/\"\u003eDirect Action Everywhere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut not everyone wants to come to us and listen when we try to tell them the truth about animal agriculture. Some people choose to turn away to ignore the reality. To make sure that no one can later on say \u0027I didn\u0027t know\u0027 we enter places that promote animal suffering. There we speak up in megaphones with Direct Action\u00a0and inform the public. We make sure that everyone\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eknows, there is no humane way, to kill someone that doesn\u0027t want to die. Direct action is there to disrupt and change the whole system (instead of individuals)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCommunity\u003cbr\u003eBy participating in all of these events, we are creating a strong community for vegan activists. Vegans often feel powerless because they often only see the suffering in this world. By being active, you immediately see the positive change we can make together. This empowers us immensely and wants us to do even more for the animals. Creating such a strong community, we believe, is \u0027the\u0027 way to speed up creating a vegan world where animals are free from suffering.\u003cbr\u003eTogether we can make that change!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich countries will we visit?\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0We will visit countries like Luxembourg, Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, Greece, Romania, Poland, Latvia, Finland, Norway, Denmark and many more. Our Patreons help making this trip possible and are appreciated very much. We will have an exclusive monthly live video about our trip only for Patreons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to be a patron but still would like to see what we are doing, you can follow us on Facebook:\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Activism-On-The-Road-559469084438381/\"\u003eActivism On The Road\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
