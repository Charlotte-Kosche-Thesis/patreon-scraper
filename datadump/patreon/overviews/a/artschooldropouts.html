To be honest, I never thought that there would be people out there that would enjoy the silly videos that I make with my friends. I started making these videos to make myself smile and to keep treasured memories that I make with friends to look back in my older years, but I\u0027m so happy that you guys are out there that love our content. I\u0027m truly grateful to share our laughs and smiles with all of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I don\u0027t actually expect anyone to donate to us; you guys sharing and appreciating our videos is honestly enough to fill our hearts with gratitude...but for those that want to extend us more of a helping hand - we hope that these Patreon pledges are awesome options for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo, what do you get for being a patron?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHere\u0027s a quick overview of some of the benefits:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eEvery first Wednesday of the month, we have ASK THE DROPOUTS, where we answer your questions. If you are a patron and have donated $2 or more, we\u2019ll answer all your questions first!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eFirst look at future projects that we are in production in! Sneak peeks, behind the scenes videos, and photos of what we\u0027re working on that is only patron-exclusive!\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShoutouts in our descriptions, special thanks in our videos, and even PRODUCER credits for our featured work! Woohoo! Perfect for those that want producer credits for their IMDB!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully these are pretty awesome incentives for you guys to help support us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do we need your help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSee, the little things that make up our videos, everything from the props to the performers, eventually add up; and because the craft of filmmaking heavily relies on \"Murphy\u0027s Law of Anything That Can Go Wrong, Will,\" we find ourselves being stretched too thin, mostly financially. Even though we keep the concepts of our videos relatively cheap and try to keep our costs down as much as possible, the usual unforeseen circumstances makes us dip deeper than what we budget. We hope that with your donations through our Patreon page, we\u0027d be able to deliver the quality of content that you guys have come to expect from us (and more!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything that you guys can give goes directly into our channel, and in turn, back to you guys to enjoy! So please take a look at our tiers and consider helping us out every month to so we can keep putting out that Art School Dropouts content you enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e"
