Fealty stories from each Nation will be released once a month to supporters of that Nation. These stories may follow a different plot than the Core Episodes, but will add to the over-all tapestry of the Archipelago. All Fealty stories will be canon, but will not be known to the supporters - or writers! - of the other Nations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFealty supporters will also get exclusive rights to vote in our Black Pearl polls. Declare your loyalty: things are about to get messy.",
