    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWhat the hell is William Shakespeare talking about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot has changed in the 400 years since an English actor and playwright wrote 37-ish plays. Language has changed. Culture has changed. Not to mention the sheer volume of material written about the man and the plays. It\u0027s almost too much. How do we get past all that cultural buildup to find the human emotions underneath the monolith?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where Clear Shakespeare comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s a new podcast series that takes you word by word through Shakespeare\u0027s plays, stripping away as much of the detritus as possible to bring us back to the amazing words themselves. I\u0027ll talk about what exactly the characters are saying and how they\u0027re saying it, and I\u0027ll add in some historical background when it\u0027s helpful. You\u0027ll read along with me as the words and characters come to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve always been put off by Shakespeare\u0027s language, Clear Shakespeare is for you. If you have to read these plays for a class or show,\u00a0Clear Shakespeare is for you. If you\u0027ve read and seen these plays a million times but want to get deeper,\u00a0Clear Shakespeare is for you. If you\u0027re directing or acting in one of these plays and don\u0027t know where to start,\u00a0Clear Shakespeare is for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut these podcast series take hundreds of hours of research, recording and editing to produce. Through Patreon, you now have a chance to support Clear Shakespeare and help me produce it faster and better. You\u0027re getting insane value for your money - just a few dollars for hours and hours of entertaining and informative content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, it takes me about three months to produce a series of podcasts based on a single play. Every contribution you make will cut down on that time - I can make this a full-time profession, and I can hire some research help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGive now, and make Shakespeare clear!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLearn more at:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://clearshakespeare.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://clearshakespeare.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
