In case you\u2019re wondering, Ottawa is known for being the capital of Canada, but more notably for its poutine!

I plan to release an album of original content once a year (S.O.S. took me five years to create...) which usually includes touring and live performances (so far just regionally, but I\u2019m working on expanding outward). I also play in an Ottawa based Pop-Punk band called Quinnzelle, we play lots of shows! Your support goes towards helping me focus on my creative endeavors (I have a job that is currently footing the bill, in case you\u0027re wondering), even a single dollar goes a long way!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Will You Do With My Monies?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://anndynegative.com/patreon/bioblock6_patreon.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEverything I make from Patreon will be rolled back into the videos and music that I create.
