    "summary": "My whole life has revolved around making art. When I was a little boy I wrote stories and practiced martial arts. I reached the age where I needed to decide on a career, I deferred my acceptance to University and went to the Shaolin Temple and Asia. I wanted to teach martial arts for a living and I had goals to achieve. Fast forward to the present; I\u0027m a 7th degree black belt, a two-time National Champion, a National Coach and I own my own school. Teaching martial arts (in the traditional sense) does not make me a wealthy man, but I love it. I\u0027ve always had stories to write too, and now based on my extensive life experiences I have more to draw on and be inspired by. So I\u0027m asking you, my potential patron, to support my further quest in the arts. In ancient China a martial artist would be welcomed in by a family and was entrusted to teach the family martial arts. This early patronage mirrored the practice in Europe with painters and poets. I want to continue to write, tell stories, teach and share. Combining these into this new form of patronage allows me to share my knowledge in martial arts and fitness, giving back to those interested in reading what I have to write."
