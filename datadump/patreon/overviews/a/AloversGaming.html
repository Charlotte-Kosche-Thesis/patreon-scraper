I am a very passionate Let\u0027s Player / vlogger on YouTube under the name AloversGaming. I\u0027ve been making these let\u0027s plays since 2011 and have no interest in ever quitting. Currently i\u0027ve made over \u003cstrong\u003e1,000\u003c/strong\u003e YouTube videos. It is my biggest love in life as weird as that sounds. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, making the constant content isn\u0027t easy. From buying the necessary games to hours spent every day recording, editing, and networking there\u0027s little time to do anything else with my life. Some very important things. Trying to build up a YouTube channel is a journey of endless stress and work. I made a Patreon in hopes that through the support of my fans that i\u0027ll be able to provide better quality videos and content for as long as possible. Any support given will not be taken lightly, I will be forever grateful for the help you\u0027ve given me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOU GET FROM THIS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s be real here. I play video games. I\u0027m not a big artist or doing anything special, so coming up with ways to thank you for your support is incredibly difficult, but we\u0027ll see how this sounds: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI get a lot of requests weekly to play certain games, some old, many new. Right now most games I play are older titles from the mid \u002790s to the late \u002700s barring a few exceptions. With your help on my Patreon i\u0027ll be able to buy newer games, ones that aren\u0027t 5 to 10 years old; though those will never go away. I\u0027ll be able to upload and release more content than ever instead of pacing myself while I search for the cheapest used copy of a PS2 classic on Ebay. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting my Patreon you all get more let\u0027s plays, and LPs of newer games. And should it go real well - more creative content revolving around gaming and other interests we share, because the support you show me on Patreon will not only make getting my let\u0027s plays up on YouTube faster, it means i\u0027ll actually have time to spend on making different content: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMini reviews, highlights, videos regarding my thoughts on the current state of gaming and the latest news. Basically, everything I get asked to talk about on Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube, i\u0027ll finally have time to talk about without causing a delay in my main productions: Let\u0027s Plays.
