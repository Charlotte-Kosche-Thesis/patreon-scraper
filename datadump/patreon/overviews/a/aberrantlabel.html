Everything is free, so go for it! When your done browsing and listening come back here and read the rest of the page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore About Me and What I\u0027m Doing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play guitar, bass, keyboards (kinda anyway) and sing. I also enjoy drawing, painting, and well... just creating new things. Until recently a large majority of my creations have gone unseen and unheard by anyone but a small handful of people. Not anymore. Today\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aberrantlabel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAberrant Label\u003c/a\u003e is home to all of my artistic creations, but it is my intention that one day Aberrant Label will become a community of artists reaching audiences in new and exciting ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAt present, I find myself releasing new material through my site every few days for projects like BC and bigBOT, which is keeping me really busy. I am also creating new content for my youtube channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, you can help by checking the site,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aberrantlabel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAberrant Label\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0often and sharing songs and art you like with friends. If you are feeling especially moved, maybe even like us on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/aberrantlabel\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e. This is a great way to show your support and help us build a strong presence. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor those saying, there must be more I can do.\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes, there is.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis site, Patreon, allows fans to become patrons of their favorite artists. Fans can make donations to content creators, like myself, for works that they complete. You choose your amount, from a dollar to... well you just be as generous as you want. It will be appreciated. You can also set up a monthly cap for donations as well. So whether it\u0027s a $1 donation with a $1 monthly budget or a $5 donation with a $15 monthly budget, you the fan, will directly support your favorite artists\u0027 endeavors to create new art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWhile I accept larger donations, and who wouldn\u0027t really, I want to stress there is no need to give more than a dollar. This will get you access to all the same material at this time. This may change somewhat in the future, but the idea that I would like to stick to here is that all contributors will receive my songs and accompanying artwork. If you want to give more, I thank you, it is appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get out of this arrangement? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will provide access to digital song releases and high quality digital copies of \u003cem\u003emy\u003c/em\u003e artwork to patrons. This includes works by Bernard Caraviello, bigBOT, and BC as well as any other projects that are created solely by Bernard Caraviello. I would very much like anyone who appreciates my art to be able to own some of it, so while I may create a tiered subscription at some point to ensure contributors donating more are duly compensated, the majority of my art will be available to anyone who donates at any level.\u00a0I am still new to Patreon so I am still figuring out other gifts that fans will truly appreciate and I will gladly consider any suggestions from patrons as I learn to navigate this new platform. \u00a0I may eventually do some special works for my most generous patrons as well as videos or blogs on the methods, equipment and supplies I use for content creation. I will also be working on coming up with a schedule for content release, but would like feedback from fans and will continue to investigate how other Patreon content creators are addressing this issue. I am currently working on my youtube channel and I hope to be able to present original art and perhaps even a music video or two (goals, that still need to be worked out before I add them here).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything Else? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eJust to reiterate,\u00a0I do not expect fans to become patrons in exchange for access to my artistic creations. As I mentioned above, my personal website,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.aberrantlabel.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAberrant Label\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0hosts my artwork and music. This site is free to all and I encourage you to visit it and check out my work regularly. \u003cbr\u003eBy contributing financially to Aberrant Label, patrons can\u00a0provide help towards much needed supplies, and help fund new and innovative ideas for reaching new audiences. In the process benefactors will receive new music and art for each act of support.\u003cbr\u003eTo all who decide to support my creative endeavors through Patreon,\u00a0I humbly thank you for your support and want you to know that you are making a difference. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
