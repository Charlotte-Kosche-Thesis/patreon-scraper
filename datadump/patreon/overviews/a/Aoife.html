Last year I was awarded a 12 month residency at the European Space Agency and Ars Electronica and things have stepped up a gear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLike many artists, I have always had a supporting job while pursuing my art career. I am now in a position where I have a number of exciting projects, which are springboarding my career to the next level, but have no extra time to financially support myself and make these a success. This is where I hope Patreon will lend a hand or two.. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/af/20/d9/af20d9ecabac456e09f5c396f142eb6c.png\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I am using Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo - 2016 was an amazing year for my career but a lot of these new opportunities do not cover their costs enough to allow a roof over your head. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany moons ago a friend and I pondered the idea of patronage over the web and I am so pleased there is a more personal platform available for people to invest in the long term progress of artists. I really believe in this process. No one is simply giving money \u2013 they get art back and that\u2019s simple and easy. I also believe in art being affordable and am committing to produce works and editions from \u00a355 upwards, so that throughout my career someone can always afford something, even if you only pay \u00a32 a month you can get something by the end of the year with a small top up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a practical level I would rather know that I am getting \u00a31000 per month than get \u00a312000 in one lump sum from regular crowdfunding. It creates a steady income which is often the problem with artist and freelance work. Allowing me to focus on making truly powerful work that will have an impact on the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start with, I am simply sharing this with friends and family but please share with a wider network of people you think might be interested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you be supporting?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe practical stuff - Help with covering studio overheads, expenses and materials and laboor for making the work ordered or commissioned through Patreon. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRequired self funding - My residency at the European Space Agency, Ars Electronica and the Arts Council International Development Fund trips to the Netherlands and Austria require me to raise an amount of funding myself in order for it all to happen! \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eResearch - This help will not only allow me time needed to apply for commissions and work, but it will also allow continued research into the psychological impact of my developing work with explosives and projects helping trauma victims.

This has been amazing to receive and I am incredibly excited to be working on this until September 2017.  During the residency I will be based in Holland and Austria for up to three months to develop and realise the project Star Storm - a series of explosive performances which will describe the physics of the sun and the stars.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe only problem is that although the residency is funded, it is only enough money to cover the direct expenses related to the trips and in no way covers my overheads while I am away. It also does not cover the time needed for research and development while in London. I feel that it is incredibly important to me to make the most of this residency and do it justice. For that I need time to focus and make my work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArts Council International Development Award\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArts Council have granted me the International development award and grant. This fund aims to develop my international career in Holland where the ESA residency is taking place. As part of this I will present talks and workshops in Amsterdam, learn how to do 3D printing, meet with many artists, curators, gallery directors, arts festival directors and other arts practitioners in Holland with  view to securing future work and exhibitions. I will also establish connection with explosive and pyrotechnic companies in Holland and research working spaces.  Arts Council funding expect some of the cost of the trips to be covered by other sources. I have stated that a proportion of the money I raise on Patreon will be used to fund these trips.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInternational Astronautical Congress\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn September 25-29th I will attend the 67th International Astronautical Congress held this year in Adelaide Australia to present the finding of my research paper, \u2018Can Artists And Creative Practitioners Help To Shape The Future Of Humankind In Space Beyond Design?\u2019\u003cbr\u003eThe abstract proposal has been accepted so now I need to get down and write the paper.

A\nmulti-disciplinary artist, as well as blowing things up, her practice\nspans sculpture, installation, drawing, photography, film and\nperformance. She creates abstract works which often examine concepts\nof time, density and matter as well as deep human emotions and\nmotivations. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith a minimal aesthetic, a sense of balance and\nan appreciation for natural forms, Aoife van Linden Tol\u0027s works speak\nfor themselves visually. The explosive medium can result in\ndevastatingly ravaged and torn pieces, such as with the \u003cem\u003eMeta\u003c/em\u003e\nseries of bombs on sheet copper and aluminium, which command a\npowerful visceral connection with the viewer. The work has thus\nevoked strong emotional responses from audiences where viewers have\nspontaneously shared intimate and sensitive histories with the\nartist. Yet her versatility and skill with the medium allows her to\nmake surprisingly small, delicate, and even humorous works. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA\njoy of learning, constantly questioning mind and a keen analytical\nnature feed a scientific process of research, testing and making.\nGraduating from Central St Martins College of Art and Design in 2002,\nwith a BA Hons in Art \u0026amp; Design, Aoife van Linden Tol has\nexhibited internationally including at the ICA, London, the San\nFrancisco MOMA, USA and the NGBK Berlin. Aoife has recently worked\nwith Imperial Collage, researching light spectra for a series in neon\nand was invited by Disney to design a limited edition model Star Wars\nBB-8 robot which was auctioned by Force for Change charity benefiting\nGreat Ormond St Hospital.",
