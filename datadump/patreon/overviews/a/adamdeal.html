    "summary": "Hello, my name is Adam Deal, and I believe I was born to write.\nEver since I read Jurassic Park at the tender age of ten (not even joking, I\ndid the math) I have had the writing bug. It was many years before I started\nseriously writing, but I\u2019ll never forget the wonder I felt turning those pages\nand realizing a \u003cem\u003eperson\u003c/em\u003e created all\nthat. Now it\u2019s my turn. I want to give you that same sense of wonder through\nincredible stories. Stories of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.\nStories of women, people of color, the hearing impaired, and the LGBTQ community\njust to name a few; represented in roles and with respect rarely seen in the\nmajority of media.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eOne of these characters lives on a world called Asteria,\nfilled with magic, legends, and more than just a little danger. The timeline in\nthis story stretches from days long past to a present filled with an eclectic\nmix of magic and technology. This is a multi-book series, and each month will bring\na new chapter in the adventure, beginning with book one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003ePosting each month with \u003cem\u003eAsteria\u003c/em\u003e\nwill be a monthly series called \u003cem\u003eLuk \u003c/em\u003e(pronounced\nLuck). \u003cem\u003eLuk \u003c/em\u003eexplores the darker parts\nof our soul while questioning where the line between good and evil lies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow you can help:\u003c/strong\u003e While \u003cem\u003eAsteria\u003c/em\u003e\nand \u003cem\u003eLuk\u003c/em\u003e are already in the beginning\nstages, what I lack is the time to fully flesh them out. My dream is to turn\nthem into published works, but that is a hard balance to maintain while working\nfull time and attending school. Work is unavoidable, but school was born of\ndesperate necessity. Two college degrees have left me with a student debt\nrivaling some mortgages, the cost of which has forced me back into school\nseeking survival by deferment. Many on Patreon have goals they are trying to\nmeet; I have two:\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGoal One: $1,000/month. By achieving this goal I can leave\nschool for good, freeing up more time for writing.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nGoal Two: $3,000/month. By achieving this goal I can leave\nmy current job to pursue writing full time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI don\u2019t honestly know how realistic it will be to hit either\nof these goals, but if you are interested in supporting my dream please check\nout the rewards tiers. As I get closer to my goals I hope to add more of them,\nand a greater variety of rewards. Please know that no matter what tier you may\nchoose, I sincerely appreciate your support, it makes all the difference!\u003cbr\u003e"
