Each week I take online viewers from around the world on a walk\u00a0in real time, pointing\u00a0out\u00a0hidden details \u0026amp; anecdotes that make this city magical.

Thank you for considering supporting this project. I think we\u2019re onto something pretty special here.  Who am I and what\u2019s the project? I\u2019m an ex-New Yorker who fell in love with a French girl \u0026amp; moved to Paris 8 years ago. I also fell deeply in love with this city, so I\u2018ve been a full time tour guide, photographer, \u0026amp; Paris blogger ever since. My last name is Frye, hence the moniker A French Frye in Paris. \ud83d\ude42  I recently started a brand new concept - the first of its kind - broadcasting LIVE video tours from the streets of Paris. I take online viewers through my favorite areas in real time and point out the hidden details \u0026amp; intriguing anecdotes that make this city so magical. Each video is a mix of archictecture, history, food, art, and general French goodness. Think of it as a virtual tour of Paris for when you can\u2019t physically be in Paris.   I\u2019m the first Paris guide to do this and I\u2019d love for you to be a part of the adventure. Are we revolutionizing the guided tour industry? Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves...but yeah, that\u2019s kinda the idea. And that\u2019s where you come in!  My live video tours are 100% free, and I want to keep them that way. But as you know, even free stuff takes a lot of time. Your generous donation will help to support this project and ensure its survival; it will also give me more freedom to expand the idea and offer more developed video tours in the future.   As a Patreon member you\u2019ll receive exclusive Paris content that \" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy YouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. I think we\u2019re at the \u003cstrong\u003eforefront of a new movement\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eand I want you to be a part of the adventure. Are we poised to revolutionize the tour industry? Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves...but yeah, that\u2019s kinda the idea. \ud83d\ude42\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow can you be part of it? My\u00a0weekly FB Live Video Tours are free and I hope to keep them that way. But as you know even free stuff takes time, effort, and planning. Your monthly donation ensures the project\u2019s survival and gives me freedom to expand it. In real terms it means that instead of being at my day job I\u2019ll be able to make more videos, refine my content, and manage the ever-growing French Frye community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your contribution you\u2019ll get rewards that I\u2019ve chosen especially for you: exclusive blog content, PDF\u2019s of each video tour, early announcements, input on where I go next, even \u003cstrong\u003eadditional private video tours\u003c/strong\u003e.
