Since 2014, I\u0027ve used my column writing and social media habits to engage conversations on race, class, sexuality, mental health, and nerd culture.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I Write\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI once tried fitting my creative writing into the gaps between my full-time work and multiple freelance gigs. That...didn\u0027t work out so well. Going this route will allow me to keep my column schedule streamlined, and to keep my writing much more focused towards posts, essays, and reviews that amplify voices of colour. Producing the work comes much easier when it isn\u0027t constrained by the on-spec nature of most print and digital media outlets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what does that look like?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eBlog Posts (Right away)\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI cover a lot of ground - gaming, pop culture, race, politics, and I bring both my career background and my Black nerd lens to my essays. The best of the bunch will be released in a monthly newsletter along with the reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eBook Reviews (Once 1st goal is reached)\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause authors of colour have an extraordinarily hard time breaking into the mainstream market, I\u0027d like to do my part by reading their work, and producing reviews at least once a month. Authors like Minister Faust, Nnedi Okorafor, and Amish are currently high on my list. And I\u0027m always open to suggestions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu\u003eStories\u003c/u\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSojourners (once 1st goal reached):\u003c/strong\u003e A serialized adventure story about young travelers in a very weird future, searching for their parents through the lyrics to a long-lost song.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNumidians at the Wall (once 2nd goal reached):\u003c/strong\u003e A serialized historical fiction podcast about a Numidian cavalry who are called up by the Roman empire to take down a threat at Hadrian\u0027s Wall.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs Yet Unnamed Afrofantasy Story (once 3rd goal reached):\u003c/strong\u003e An epic fantasy story set within a declining empire, barely holding itself together before a powerful force returns to upend the lives of a farmer, a soldier, a noblewoman, and a student.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I am\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first time I picked up a video game controller was in 1983, two years before kindergarten. I opened my first X-Men comic book a year later. By grade 1, I\u0027d inhaled C.S. Lewis\u0027 \u003cem\u003eThe Lion the Witch, and the Wardrobe\u003c/em\u003e, and I fell right out when my mother gifted me the remaining \u003cem\u003eChronicles\u003c/em\u003e for Christmas. I say all this to say, I\u0027ve been a geek since before I knew what a geek even was.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also grew up Black in Toronto, Ontario. Which meant I saw faces of colour all around me in the real world, but I had to use my own imagination when it came to Faer\u00fbn and Middle Earth. This is why I started reading into the history of the African continent, getting to know entire worlds and cultures that are almost nonexistent in the mainstream fantasy genre. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy paid writing gigs have covered topics from cultural appropriation, to labour policy and class warfare, to police brutality. I enjoy what I do, and I consider my essays important work, but this is writing that I consider subtractive. It takes something out of me to produce this work. Creative writing, on the other hand, is nourishing. The characters I create, and the world in which I\u0027ve grown them, adds something to me. And hopefully, it allows me to add something something beneficial to the world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the business of creative writing is, after all, a business. As a new father, writing on spec isn\u0027t something I\u0027ve got the convenience of doing any more. So I started this Patreon account to experiment with telling everything from children\u0027s stories to fantasy epics. I\u0027d like to write stories that my daughters can one day read, and stories that I hope you\u0027ll enjoy too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks very much for your support! I\u0027m looking forward to creating with, and for\u00a0 you."
