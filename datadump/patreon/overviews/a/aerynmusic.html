Then, I will make my passion my life and bridge the gap\nbetween work and play. \n\t\u003c/strong\u003eMore details in the goals section.\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPrologue:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGoing into college, I wanted\nto head into a field I could be passionate about, but as I have always thought\nrather logically, I wanted to feel sure I\u2019d be able to make a living in life\nwith a steady career path. So naturally, I chose the most stable industry\npossible: the Music Industry (that\u2019s a joke, by the way). I\ngraduated from Monmouth University in May of 2015 with a Bachelor\u2019s degree in\nMusic Industry. Feeling terribly unsteady on account of what working in music\nbusiness really meant at this time, I diverted my attention to my interests of\ngraphic and web design for the better part of the next year and a half.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nAbout The Music:\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI started producing music under the name AERYN nearly 1\nyear ago in June of 2016. Since then, I have come across many obstacles,\nopportunities, and general life challenges.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 120px; text-align: right;\"\u003e\n\t(As we all have and do)\n\u003c/div\u003e\nI began to focus on making\nmore original music and, though feeling very apprehensive, I started to release\nmy own songs onto SoundCloud. By the time I arrived home from a month\u2019s travel\nin Singapore and Bali the end of February 2017, many requests for\ncollaborations and vocal features were piling up in my inbox.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eI suddenly felt a\nsensation that was unfamiliar\u2026 \n\u003cstrong\u003eEase\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat\ndo you mean?\n\u003cstrong\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e I mean,\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003efor the \u003cstrong\u003efirst time I was at ease\u003c/strong\u003e. For the first time,\u00a0I didn\u2019t feel a\nstruggle to find what \n\u003cem\u003efelt\u003c/em\u003e right or\ncare what \n\u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e right. I finally felt\nsecure in that what I was doing at the current moment, I had to continue and it\nwould work out. Oh, I was overwhelmed with the amount of work in such a short\nperiod of time, but a good kind of overwhelming nonetheless.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI never once before\nconsidered \n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003emaking\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cstrong\u003emusic\u003c/strong\u003e as a career\npath. I thought perhaps I would still do it on the side as a hobby here and\nthere, but never thought I could make it my primary source of income. But now,\nI am convinced. I am driven to make this a reality. My reality. Whether it be\nproducing my own music as AERYN, creating soundtracks for films or video games,\nor working on my sound design chops and become a Foley artist. Any or all of\nthese options are what I know I can achieve and believing \u2013 ACTUALLY believing\nthat you can achieve something is, in my opinion, one of the most \n\u003cstrong\u003epowerful\u003c/strong\u003e\ndriving factors we can possibly experience as humans.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nEpilogue:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eSo what is next for me\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h4\u003e\nEvery day I am learning what does and doesn\u2019t work for me as a producer, audio engineer, and musician. However, I want to learn how to properly do what I am attempting to figure out each day. I am in no sort of denial that there is so much more for me to learn.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eI have applied to Masters\nprograms in Sound Design at two schools in Scotland\n\u003c/strong\u003e for the fall of 2017 in hopes\nto do just that. Initially, I thought it was unrealistic to apply to the\nprograms I stumbled across since I am already in such debt from my\nundergraduate studies. I cast the idea aside until one day I had thoroughly\nconvinced myself of every benefit to attending this program. This is one reason why I hope to become fully self-sufficient so if I do in fact get accepted, I won\u2019t feel held back in my productivity.\u00a0Additionally, If I am admitted, I hope you can help me\n\u003cem\u003e make this possibility a reality.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
