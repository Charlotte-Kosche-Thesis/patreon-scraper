    "summary": "Virtual Chronicler of the Faery Realm\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi everyone! Thank-you for stopping by! Kick off your shoes and hang out a while. Just stay away from the goblins...they bite.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been painting faeries for more than 20 years. I work primarily in watercolor, but I also like to add a little ink, colored pencils...sometimes whatever I can find. I hope that I create images that inspire others to create, make people happy, and help brighten their mood and maybe get them through tough moments in life. Sometimes we all need to believe in a little magic, even if it\u0027s just for a short while.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy am I on Patreon? I\u0027m hoping it will allow me to interact with people who really want to be here and love the art. Social media gets to be a bit much even on the best of days. My hope is that Patreon will provide a more pleasant atmosphere. Also, the costs of being a working artist continue to grow every year. (Shop fees, seller fees, transaction fees, monthly fees for various services, advertising, etc.) While my overhead has steadily become nearly unmanageable, I haven\u0027t raised my print prices in.....a very very long time. And I don\u0027t want to raise them! When I started my business more than 20 years ago, my goal was to have \naffordable art that inspired people and made them happy. I\u0027d like to \nkeep that goal alive!\u00a0 Pledges coming from Patreon will go towards overhead and printing costs, and cover postage costs involved in shipping prizes to Patreon winners. :) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy plan is to post lots of process photos and explain my techniques. Currently my goal is a new \"work in progress\" post once a week. Please feel free to ask questions about the process or even about the art business in general. I have been in the business over 20 years, and have seen it evolve and grow. I\u0027m also a \"think outside the box\" person, so I often tackle this business from odd angles. :D \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thank-you for taking the time to stop by. I truly appreciate it. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to add my materials list here in case anyone is interested. These are my current favorite materials. \u003cbr\u003eMaterials List:\u003cbr\u003e(I am currently trying new papers...searching for my favorite, but my previous favorite is Arches Bright White Hot Press 300lb watercolor paper)\u003cbr\u003e\nDaniel Smith Extra Fine Watercolors\u003cbr\u003e(I am also looking for new brushes, but currently use Trekell round brushes for watercolors)\u003cbr\u003e\nPigma Micron archival ink pens\u003cbr\u003eFaber Castell PITT pens\u003cbr\u003e\nA good white plastic eraser\u003cbr\u003e\nPrismacolor colored pencils\u003cbr\u003e\nUniball Signo white gel pens\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***A short note on the Print Club tier: For those new to the print club, most months we\u0027ll vote on the print for that month (sometimes I have a pre-chosen print for a specific month, so there won\u0027t be a vote that month). It takes roughly 2 weeks to have prints printed and signed. Shipping usually starts the first week of the following month. (i.e. January prints ship in February, February prints ship in March, etc.) Print Club print sizes are 8x10 or 8.5x11 depending on how the image fits the paper. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***Digital Downloads: (required legal mumbo jumbo) The digital downloads provided through Patreon are for personal use only. No permission is given for sharing and/or selling of the files or arts/crafts made from the files. All art, files, etc are owned exclusively by Amy Brown /Amy Brown Fantasy Art Inc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e***NEW PATREON PATRON ONLY SHOP!*** I\u0027ve opened a section at my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.amybrownart.com\"\u003ewww.amybrownart.com\u003c/a\u003e for Patreon patrons. It\u0027s password access only and there will be a new password every month. The new section is for advanced access to new items, special discounts, sales, etc. There might not be new items in it every month, but I will post when new items are added. Usually updates to the shop happen 13th - 15th of the month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMonthly Schedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n(tentative dates,\nsince Life tends to throw things at me on a regular basis)\u003cbr\u003e\n*During the first week of the month, once pledges clear, I will draw names and\nannounce the monthly give-aways!\u003cbr\u003e\n*Every MONDAY -\nweekly WIPs (work in progress pics) will be posted. (Tuesday at the\nlatest)\u003cbr\u003e\n*Throughout the month I will\npost download previews (coloring pages, etc) - downloads are for tiers $5 and up.\nDownloads will be available after pledges clear at the end of the\nmonth.\u003cbr\u003e\n*The middle of every month (usually the 15 th) I will stock the Patron shop at amybrownart.com with a\npreview of the prints I\u0027ll be releasing the following month. Patrons\nwill have advanced access to new prints and discounts on  certain\nsizes.\u003cbr\u003e\n*Around the 2nd week of the month I will post the choices for the\nmonthly Print Club print. Print Club members ($15 tier and up) will\nhave a few days to vote on their favorite print. I will then place an\norder for the winning image. The first week of the following month, print club prints\nwill start shipping. (example: January prints ship first week of February) It can take a week or so to get all of them out.\nIf there are any delays, I will post the info. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n*$5 tier and up - Beginning of the\nfollowing month, once pledges clear, I will send out the\nlink/password for the monthly downloads (usually between the 3rd and 5th of the month). Patrons\nwill have approximately 3 weeks to grab their downloads. \n(example: January downloads will be available by Feb 3rd-5th. February downloads will be available by Mar 3rd-5th, etc)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Ink drawings will be on toned paper like the image above and may include metallic and colored pencil accents. They will be shipped randomly, so every month you will be surprised. Most themes will be faeries, but I will shake it up occasionally and do mermaids, \u00a0fairy foxes...whatever tickles my fancy. Please note: if you live outside the US, postage is much more expensive, so I will need to bill for the additional shipping each month. (Canada $10USD and everywhere else $17USD) Thank-you for understanding.\u00a0",
