    "summary": "It only seemed natural that I would eventually pick up a camera.\u003cbr\u003eMy great grandfather and his brother were photographers at the turn of the 20th century. My mother\u0027s dad and my own father were both amateur shutterbugs in their day and I loved playing with cameras as a kid.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I sat and watched the birds and (especially) squirrels playing in my backyard. I started taking pictures of them on my phone. Soon, I found that wasn\u0027t enough and I invested in a decent camera. I had so much fun learning to use it that I decided to look into classes to see how I could progress even further.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve taken workshops, studied with online academies and I am currently enrolled in the photography program at the University of Tennessee. I am happy to say that I am on track to graduate this spring. I love sharing my photos and it\u0027s amazing to look back and see how I\u0027ve improved through the years.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve gone from those birds and squirrels to landscapes, portrait work, still life photography, and right now I\u0027m studying more artistic styles. I still prefer nature, but almost anything goes! (I promise, it won\u0027t be all squirrels, they just made awesome sincere models for my page. And they work for peanuts. :) )\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you can watch that progression as well and help me grow as an artist and photographer. There\u0027s always equipment, lenses, even workshop fees and every little bit helps. Thank you for joining me on my journey. Now let\u0027s go have some fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
