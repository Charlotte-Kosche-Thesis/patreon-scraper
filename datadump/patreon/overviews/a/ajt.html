I expound on this further in a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://aeon.co/ideas/if-work-dominated-your-every-moment-would-life-be-worth-living\" target=\"_blank\"\u003escience-fiction-based article I wrote for\u00a0Aeon\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DID I DISCOVER THIS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the past 7 years, I\u0027ve had philosophical conversations with many individuals--those living in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street, those in Scandinavia and South America. After a while, I began to see something uncanny happening: the more I spoke with those who had never met before, people from different cultures and backgrounds, the more I began to notice that work had come to be central in their lives and that they were suffering as a result. In fact, the closer I looked, the more I began to see work \u003cem\u003ealmost everywhere\u003c/em\u003e. I wanted to know how this occurred, what it meant, and why it mattered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHEN SHALL WORK BECOME TOTAL?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWork shall truly be\u00a0\u003cem\u003etotal\u003c/em\u003e when all of the following conditions are met:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. When work is the center around which all else in life turns.\u003cbr\u003e2. When almost everything else in life is not only put in the service of but also made subservient to work.\u003cbr\u003e3. When leisure, play, and festivity slowly, perhaps imperceptibly are turned into work.\u003cbr\u003e4. When we come to believe that we were born to work.\u003cbr\u003e5. When all other ways of living, those that existed before work took over the world, fall away from cultural memory.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe truth is that we\u0027re on the verge of all this becoming true.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DOES IT MATTER?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo begin with, many human beings are suffering their burdensome ideas about work (see the video essay above); it\u0027s these ideas that I\u0027m trying to elaborate upon in various media (see \"How Can I Learn More?\" below). Secondly and at a more fundamental level, our ideas about work, those that define the modern culture we live in, have been obscuring the possibility of our embracing the \u003cem\u003evita contemplativa \u003c/em\u003e(the contemplative life). I define genuine leisure as that which \u003cem\u003eenables \u003c/em\u003eus to apprehend ultimate reality.\u00a0Could work be closing us off from deeper immersion in reality: from genuine love, from art, from philosophy, and from religion or spirituality? I now think so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS THE BROADER AIM?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m trying to trace the disappearance of the \u003cem\u003evita contemplativa\u003c/em\u003e and the emergence of a new work form of the \u003cem\u003evita activa\u003c/em\u003e (the active life). It took a long time for work to take over the world. Ancient Greeks viewed work as ignoble, slavish, and ignoble while those living in the medieval period regarded work as penance for Original Sin. It was only after the Protestant Reformation that the value of work was turned on its head. The result is that the useful, the necessary, the urgent, and the expedient have not only won out but also eclipsed any ideas of the higher, the greater, and the more real. I want to understand what this unacknowledged loss of a greater, abiding reality means for us, and I want also to see how we can begin to rethink the \u003cem\u003evita contemplativa\u003c/em\u003e for our time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW CAN I LEARN MORE?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eVisit:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://totalwork.us/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etotalwork.us\u003c/a\u003e.

To that end, I structure my life according to an ongoing practice: I have philosophical conversations each day with individuals living all around the world--from North America to Central America to Europe to Asia--about the nature of a good life; I examine my own thoughts and actions each day; I write with a view to understanding the modern world (its history as well as its coordinates); and I meditate multiple times a day in a Zen Buddhist style. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past 7 years, I\u0027ve lived in a gift economy, supporting myself as well as my fiancee through this means. In a gift economy, each person offers what he or she can based on what he or she has in order to meet another person\u0027s material needs (food, water, shelter, warmth, coldness, and health care). The point of a gift economy is to cultivate proper, disinterested generosity: offering neither too much nor too little but just enough of what money each has on the basis of admiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see using Patreon not, then, as a form of payment but as a natural extension of a micro-patronage model.\u003cbr\u003e",
