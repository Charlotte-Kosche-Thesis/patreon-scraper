    "summary": "Hello and Welcome to my Patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon page exists primarily for those who wish to extend their gratitude in the form of electronic funds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have been producing many videos since 2013 and feel extremely passionate in sharing the work of those I promote since they have made such a large impact in my life (the above video is one of my personal favorites). Subsequently, the existence of my channel also builds a platform for discussion between myself and my viewers in which we may possibly garner more learning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnlike other creators, I do not deal with heavy graphic logos, hours of editing, animation, expensive equipment, a production team and all the rest of it. There isn\u0027t a whole lot of work I put into one single video, which is usually just a picture with audio. However, please recognize that my channel, as a whole, was done with much work and effort.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT ARE MY GOALS?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust two:\u003cbr\u003e$20 - I will caption any video on my channel.\u003cbr\u003e$35 - I will ask a person to react to any 15 minute video on my channel. I may also use longer videos, but they\u0027re only allowed to watch 15 minutes of it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eANY REWARDS FOR MY PATRONS?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI currently do not have any Patreon rewards.
