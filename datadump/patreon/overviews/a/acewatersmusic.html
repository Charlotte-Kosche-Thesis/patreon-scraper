    "summary": "My name is Ace. You might know me from my music videos on YouTube. I am a synth focused musician who creates unique arrangements of video game and geek culture music. I have been releasing weekly videos for over two years.If you don\u0027t, maybe check one out now:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e5vrCASARQg\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking unique arrangements each week ends up taking a lot of time and effort, which is why I wanted to launch this patreon page. I love what I do, but I really need to be able to pay for food if I am going to keep going at the rate I want to.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was first inspired to create my videos from a little group named \"Pomplamoose\". You might know them. So, when Jack announced this cool new idea called Patreon, I was instantly invested in the idea. The idea of having fans who believe or resonate in the art a creator makes directly support that artist, in a method similar to crowd funding just made so much sense to me. At the time, I only had a few subscribers and I wasn\u0027t sure if I would ever be able to make anything out of my channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my head, there was this far off goal of 10,000 subs which would be the moment I would start pursuing supporting myself off of my channel. I hit that goal recently, so I think its a good time to start on Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make this clear, even though I do have some rewards available, I do not think of this site as another store front. There are plenty of places where you can go and buy my music. This site is about support. It\u0027s about saying, \"Hey, I see the hard work you put into your art, and I want you to be able to keep doing it.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few rewards however, because the fact that someone would choose to support the art I create makes me so dang happy, that I just want to give something back. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for checking out the page. The main goal for me right now is to be able to create without worry. A year ago I was forced to quit my job and decided to pour my time into making music full time. This made for a very rocky year financially, and I hope with the support of fans, I will get to a point where I can take care of myself and my family while doing the thing I love, which will give me more time to get deeper into mixes, more funds to pour back into the channel, and less anxiety, which makes the whole process easier. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much, and I will see you in the Patreon feed!\u003cbr\u003e"
