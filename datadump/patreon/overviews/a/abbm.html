I\u0027m Brandon McGill, an incredibly focused (yet whimsical) artist that paints bodies, makes videos, and tries to spread joy in the process. After nearly 500 body paintings, albums worth of music, and the occasional music video, I\u0027m ready to create something new! Please watch the video to get a better idea of who I am as a person, and how you may support the cause.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can I Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing an artist shouldn\u0027t be a questionable life choice. However being one can present a number of challenges, especially when it comes to sustaining a regular income. Currently I support myself from bookings, the occasional merchandise, and private sponsorships. I would like to branch out into video content, but will need financial support to get there! Would you like to see my new series, \u003cstrong\u003eLet\u0027s Make A Mess\u003c/strong\u003e, watch behind the scenes footage, be entertained by Model Interviews, or chat with me personally? Maybe even own some original art? This is your chance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do I Get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eDepending on your level of support, you may get access to exclusive photos, artwork, hand drawn art, signed prints, and so much more! It\u0027s the perfect way to acquire \u003cstrong\u003eBrandon Loot, \u003c/strong\u003eand support my growth in the process\u003cstrong\u003e! Thank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePLUS \u003c/strong\u003ebe sure to check out the extensive content I\u0027ve already created for this Patreon! Features such as \u003cstrong\u003eIn The Studio, Too Much Tuesday, Week In Review, and Let\u0027s Make A Mess\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0feature exclusive art found nowhere else. Even cooler? I debut daring experiments I\u0027m working on here before anywhere else. Stick around, because this is going to be an exciting ride!\u003c/em\u003e"
