    "summary": "Heya! I\u0027m Auctus and I make 3D renders with very specific themes. Mostly around pregnancy and expansion. I do this in my spare time and upload them on my dA page for everyone to enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow recently, I\u0027ve started to accept commissions and they have been going really well. I never thought I\u0027d be earning money while doing something extremely fun! I\u0027ve had some people approach me about Patreon and after some long thinking, I\u0027ve come up with something that I\u0027m satisfied with and can present with pride. But I\u0027ll have to make a few things clear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m \u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003enot \u003c/b\u003egoing to lock finished content behind paywalls. \u003cstrong\u003eMy renders are, and will always be available online for free.\u003c/strong\u003e One of the $2 reward does unlock a bunch of renders, but they\u0027re still Work-In-Progress and are never meant to be uploaded in their current state. Some will stay there due to lack of interest, others will eventually be refined to an high level of quality and uploaded to my dA page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m using Patreon more as a... tipjar for a lack of a better word. Though purely one with no rewards in it, didn\u0027t feel right for me, so I added a few benefits which \u003cem\u003edoes \u003c/em\u003efeel\u00a0right\u00a0and I can manage throughout the coming months. Why?\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eBecause starting from September, my free time will be severely limited. \u003c/strong\u003eThis past year, I\u0027ve been able to do a lot more because I was catching up on classes that I\u0027ve failed the year before that. And because the number of classes wasn\u0027t high, I suddenly had a wealth of free time. Naturally, that went into my hobbies. In any case, that will come to an end in September. I will try to keep up with the suggestion boxes, but I won\u0027t make any promises. To summarize it,\u00a0I will not be as active with uploads as I used to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what are these priority slots on commissions? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThey\u0027re basically regular slots, but they\u0027re reserved for those with the current highest pledge tier. And if any remain open after 48 hours, they will be unlocked to everyone. This is a way to give a bit of extra value to the highest tier besides the 20% off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with the money?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWell, after some time I realized that I couldn\u0027t really provide bonuses or rewards for achieving a certain milestone. Some artists want to turn this to a full-time job, so they need the money and the equipment to do so. Me? This will stay as a hobby for me. I don\u0027t \u003cem\u003eneed\u00a0\u003c/em\u003ethe funds to upgrade my computer or purchase other equipment. There\u0027s no real bottleneck that limits my ability to make art, other than my personal time and motivation. The\u00a0render times aren\u0027t long enough to warrant an CPU upgrade either.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut obviously, money is always a welcome thing. I\u0027m still currently in college for at least two more years and money\u0027s relatively tight in our household. I am still extremely grateful with each dollar, but please do note that I will use the money for myself first. Saving up and whatnot. \u003cstrong\u003eUpgrading my rig is secondary, as currently it doesn\u0027t have a bottleneck that limits my ability.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope I\u0027ve shown enough information to you guys so you can make an informed decision.
