    "summary": "Hey, thanks for visiting my page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to use this Patreon to create unique art for people, because in my everyday life, I found that being given personal, hand-made gifts made me feel much more human than cash or cards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe catch is that, even if I want to do that, I\u0027m strapped for time and money, with college classes and work, while making sure my rent is paid and my cats and snake are fed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you, dear very special, very nice visitor, decide to donate to this Patreon, you will not only receive a personalized video game, artpiece, or song from an untalented creator, but get to support me and watch my skills develop as I learn from my experiences programming, drawing, and producing music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want things to be affordable enough for you to still get something neat out of, since I understand most people won\u0027t want to drop $15 on a flash game a month that might end up being lame, while also giving me a strong incentive to flesh out my skills so that eventually people can trust my work enough to be willing to pay that much for something. Not that I probably would because who has $15 anymore am I right I\u0027ve been living off of chili and pizza pls help\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll post some new audio or art weekly, and try to make at least one game a month\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNote: There\u0027s some risks to this Patreon you should know about. 1: I won\u0027t always be able to make deadlines. While I will try to produce content as quickly as possible, there is always the possibility that some college project or work or other issue will get in the way. I will be sure to alert anyone I can\u0027t deliver on time to of any issues that may arise, and apologize in advance. 2: I\u0027m one semester away from completing my Computer Science B.S. and already have a Psychology B.A., but I still have almost no artistic abilities, so be warned that you will not be getting full-length masterpieces to listen to on repeat or hang on your wall. I will make sure I do my best for you all though c:, and you can freely distribute your content at will (pls give credit tho pls i\u0027m sorry), as your content will not be available to anyone else. 3: If I eventually have too many Patron backers (which I highly doubt will ever be an issue), then I will have to cut back on rewards, or bring other artists into this Patreon. Making unique pieces of content per backer takes a lot of effort, especially if you back for a video game which requires a lot of technical learning as opposed to me mashing around on my synthesizers, and mass-producing unique content would absolutely wreck me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again :D !"
