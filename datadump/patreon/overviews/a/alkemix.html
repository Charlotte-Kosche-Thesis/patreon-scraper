    "summary": "Most of my life has been dedicated to uncovering lost knowledge, processing it, and making it available to people interested in learning and expanding their knowledge and perspectives. My goal is to continue to transform the vision in my consciousness into educational and entertaining videos, presentations and blogs comfortably prior to shedding this mortal coil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am an independent researcher, writer and video producer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m known for my work at Borderland Sciences, 1985-1995 when it was at its most productive phase. I edited 50 issues of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.scribd.com/alkemixer\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Journal of Borderland Research\u003c/a\u003e, produced numerous paperbacks and reprints of lost and alternative sciences, as well as videos on natural sciences such as my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/wvU3qAhyew8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNature Was My Teacher - The Vision of Viktor Schauberger\u003c/a\u003e, of which I have been humbled by the many amazing people who have told me that video was their awakening and introduction to the pathway of higher knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis lecture\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nc0U9PawusY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eElement and Ether\u003c/a\u003e was given in 1990, the path has carried me far from there and I seek to share what I have with those interested to learn. The existential demons of life have done much to pull me away from this work. I have stayed on track in my inner landscape and have naturally grown past this, but the foundations are well in place then. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA test run getting into editing produced \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ7I8FX-72E\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eQuaternity\u003c/a\u003e, which is a preliminary excursion into connecting trans-philosophical archetypes into a transformative flow to awaken consciousness to higher possibilities of cognition. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuaternity was followed by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7ew5HljnR0\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDorje Blessing\u003c/a\u003e, my interpretation of core archetypes of the Vajrayana school of Buddhism,\u00a0which is what I refer to as laying down some \u0027old school\u0027 tracks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve now completed \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Ii7_csNbNsA\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorkings of the Stars in Earthly Substances\u003c/a\u003e, an introduction to the cosmic alchemical works of Anthroposophical scientists Lili Kolisko \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve recently written a tribute to my great mentor \u003ca href=\"http://thomasbrown.org/trevor-james-constable/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTrevor James Constable - Trailblazing Etheric Rain Engineer\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose projects are preliminary excursions into using the video medium through which my grand vision of combining Eastern and Western archetypes into a symbolic language for transforming Art and Science, as well as achieving Cosmic Orientation of one\u0027s soul could be expressed. This greater project will encompass and put into easily grasped concepts the merging of the Four Worlds doctrine of the Qabalah with the Vajrayana mandala using the Natural Scientific approach which I have gained through Goethe\u0027s and Rudolf Steiner\u0027s scientific works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn truth I\u0027m learning as I\u0027m going, these projects are for my own self-education, with the benefit that others enjoy them. There is no claim to enlightenment here. But I do have a very good and clear vision of the projects I plan to achieve as I move forward. I continue to move forward and pray there are kind souls interested in supporting my work. There is much to do, will you please assist?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thomasbrown.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThomas Joseph Brown\u003c/a\u003e"
