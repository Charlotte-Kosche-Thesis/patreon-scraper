    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eWho\nis A.M. Brosius, and what does he do?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwrite, fiction and nonfiction: alternate history; political-economic and\ncultural theory; the history and techniques of swordplay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason that I\u0027m trying out Patreon is to get some more readers for my fiction. I am serializing a novel at DreamWidth, and maybe you\u0027d enjoy it. Occasionally I post other writings at the same site: commentary on current events, philosophical essays of various kinds, reports of my sword practices and other forms of training, and short stories, mostly set in the same Multiverse as my novels are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOther\nthings I do:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can\ncrochet, invent languages, grow my own salad, build a fire 99.9% of the time,\nhammer nails straight, tie knots correctly, fix my own truck 90% of the time,\neat no wheat, drink whiskey neat, build armor, design and sew together a tent,\nset up and tear down an encampment, occasionally win a Tournament, and so on. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can\nplay the guitar, a little, and I can shout more or less in key. I can play the drums\nand the bass, a little. I have brewed some beer (with help).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am\nan amateur historian, with varied interests including (not limited to):\nPristine Civilizations, Hellas and Byzantium, Medieval Europe, the Labor\nMovement, Dada and Surrealism, Lettrists and Situationists. Oddly, no matter what period of history I\nhappen to dig into, the new discoveries I make have never turned me back in the\ndirection of consensus reality. Shit just gets weirder and weirder.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs a\nsometime anarchist-syndicalist agitator and social critic, I have been known to\nimagine, construct and/or demolish Situations and Spectacles, but only for my\nown amusement. (Don\u0027t call me, do it yourself.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs\nfar as swordplay goes, I am first of all a student. If you know something and\ncan teach me, I will try to learn. It is not a certain proposition on either\nend. If I learn something, I try to pay it forward: if you ask, I will try to\nteach you. If you learn it, then I would expect you to teach it forward.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI have written four novels, which have a significant swordplay\ncomponent. I also published a short story collection. The Commonwealth in my fiction reflects all of\nmy many hobbies and interests.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can find my published books here:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?type\u0026amp;keyWords=A.M.Brosius\u0026amp;x=7\u0026amp;y=5\u0026amp;sitesearch=lulu.com\u0026amp;q\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.lulu.com/shop/search.ep?type\u0026amp;keyWords=A.M.Brosius\u0026amp;x=7\u0026amp;y=5\u0026amp;sitesearch=lulu.com\u0026amp;q\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
