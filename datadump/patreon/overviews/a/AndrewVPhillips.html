My mixed media drawings explore the overlapping boundaries between the outer landscape of the Earth, and inner experience. I consider aspects of landscape to be expressions of the Numinous, sacred, and my art is in part an act of devotion. Working in this manner becomes a form of communication, a conversation that creates a bridge between the seen and unseen. Part of my interest in this view of Earth as an entity is to do with healing, and the work also relates to the evident harm that has been caused to our planet - reflections on its beauty, and a lament for losses.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e7704_3d2cf0b992224deb9194d2fc9ab42d47~mv2_d_3494_2272_s_2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1482,h_964,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/6e7704_3d2cf0b992224deb9194d2fc9ab42d47~mv2_d_3494_2272_s_2.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also a qualified art therapist, and run groups working with people to cultivate the skill of creative imagination, making art in service to Nature. One of the featured \u0027rewards\u0027 here is a monthly one to one conversation, and this may appeal to people for the purpose of talking deeply about ones own inner connection to the wider web of Nature. Of course, this reward can just as well be used for informal chat about whatever you choose, or simply the pleasure of conversation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e7704_7fe48a19e2ce4bdea3aac7046f514e6f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_1401,h_964,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/6e7704_7fe48a19e2ce4bdea3aac7046f514e6f~mv2.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am joining Patreon as a way to develop a closer connection to people who are interested in the work and its themes, by providing exclusive content that delves a little deeper into my art practice, in exchange for a consistent contribution towards ongoing practice. I tend not to post much in the way of \u0027work in progress\u0027 on social media, so what is here will not be featured elsewhere. Of course the motivation is largely financial, but I would like this to make this relational, an honest exchange, and for people who are supporting the work in this way to feel they are genuinely receiving something, in addition to giving.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.wixstatic.com/media/6e7704_359c8a3790f54796afe8b69d8d15c085.jpg/v1/fill/w_1517,h_998,al_c,q_90,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01/6e7704_359c8a3790f54796afe8b69d8d15c085.webp\"\u003e"

There is a visual language present in the drawings that overlaps the outer and inner world, seen and unseen, part me, and part other - perhaps they could be called Soulscapes. We live in a time when although still radiantly beautiful, the damage done to Earth is painfully visible. This intertwining of beauty and grief is a core component of my work.",

     "description": "Provides a steady stream of income meaning that I can purchase materials necessary for my work. In addition this will fund submitting work for open-calls, exhibitions, and competitions. Although these are often something of a gamble, they can be useful ways to get the work seen, and to exhibit in places which may otherwise be off-limits. Being funded in this way would mean I can readily submit work for a much wider range of opportunities. It is surprising how the costs mount up; entry fee, hanging fee, transportation costs, can easily come to \u00a370 even for something quite local, minimising chances of making a profit even if the work is sold. Costs increase rapidly for work further afield. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0",

The alternative is to show work alongside other artists, which is still a meaningful thing to do in the right circumstances. Having my own exhibition allows a much greater freedom to focus on particular aspects or themes within my practice, or even to create a specific body of work, know there it will be visible in the world at the end of it. To hire a decent space, advertise, print flyers, opening events, is often a very significant advance payout.\u00a0",
