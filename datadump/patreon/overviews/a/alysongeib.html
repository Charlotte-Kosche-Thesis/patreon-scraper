    "summary": "Hi! \u00a0My name is Alyson Geib, an American painter. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe majority of my work is drawn from personal experiences, which may or may not have happened in my current lifetime. As a believer in reincarnation and a woman that is often referred to as an \"old soul,\" I use this in my art taking advantage of my dreams, instances of D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, and psychological imperfections. I am inspired by not only personal experiences, but also by literature, popular culture, and music. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach piece starts either as a subconscious scribble, doodle, or as a snippet of a memory or dream in my mind. I then build and adjust these snippets or doodles to fit just what it is that I want or need the viewer to see. Often, these sketches will ignite some sort of emotion inside of me, fueling the direction of the piece, and usually I will notice a common theme or recurring image within my sketches, also fueling the conceptual direction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI mainly work with acrylic paint and mixed media. This media includes acrylic gel mediums such as modeling paste, heavy gel, thickening paste, and found objects like buttons, craft beads, bottle caps (both metal and plastic), wine corks, fabric scraps, scrapbook paper, twine, craft glitter, etc. When incorporating these medias, I tend to use the gel mediums either by themselves, or as a binder to these found objects. I\u0027ve adopted the phrase \"trash paintings\" when referring to pieces with the found objects, but that is not so much a reflection of the artwork, but a commentary on my nature to hoard objects that I and others would typically consider trash. \u003cbr\u003eThe combination of a tightly rendered subject and the addition of this abstract texture is a combination I find most versatile as well as intriguing to work with. It creates a surreal world that paint itself cannot do by itself and given that the subject matter of my paintings are usually a fractured memory or distorted reality, I find that really adds to the message I am trying to convey. Not all my pieces require this sort of 3-D quality, however, and here I use acrylic by itself, watercolor or oil to create the reality that is appropriate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art is not created in my image (either a literal self-portrait or metaphorical) for self- satisfaction or vanity. All of my work is intended to tell a story about me, one that I cannot physically describe with words in a novel or through photographs. Not all the stories I tell are happy or pretty, but I still want the experience and emotion of the piece to be relatable. The ultimate goal with my art is to meet others on some sort of level that we can both understand without me having to stumble over my words. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile you are here, feel free to decide how deep you would like to dive into my psyche!\u003cbr\u003e\n \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp support my passion\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLearn new techniques and mediums\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGet exclusive access to full\u00a0length videos and get motivated!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(49, 133, 155);\"\u003eTHANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SUPPORTING ME!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
