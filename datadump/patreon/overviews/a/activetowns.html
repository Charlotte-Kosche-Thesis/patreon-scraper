    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey there!\u003c/strong\u003e Thank you so much for making your way to our Patreon page.\u00a0This is John Simmerman, President and Co-Founder of Advocates for Healthy Communities, Inc. a not-for-profit 501c3 organization which is working to make the world a healthier, more activity friendly and people oriented place. Our signature program is the\u00a0\u003cem style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eActive Towns Initiative \u003c/em\u003eand we\u0027ve created this page to provide a convenient and seamless way for you to contribute to our\u00a0cause on a monthly basis in any amount that makes sense for you and your budget.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have some really big plans for the future and we are humbly asking you to be a part of it all and to be completely honest here, we simply cannot do it without your support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWant to Learn More?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Great! Your curiosity shall be rewarded in the form of a few helpful FAQs (frequently asked questions).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the Active Towns Initiative all about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Our mission is to help inspire the creation of healthy, activity promoting communities\u00a0by creating a portfolio of compelling and entertaining Active Towns profile videos, which can be consumed as stand alone content and also serve as the foundation to a future full length documentary in order to reach an even wider audience. \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eUpdate:\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0We\u0027ve identified 10 cities across the country that we\u0027ll be following closely over the next 3 years, documenting their cultural shift as they attempt to double or triple the number people choosing to ride bikes for their daily short trips. More details on this exciting documentary project to follow soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is this important?\u003c/strong\u003e Well, you may have heard, in these modern times we\u0027ve become a relatively sedentary population with a bit of a waistline problem. In fact, physical inactivity and obesity, combine as major risk factors for nearly every serious chronic disease afflicting our society, including heart disease, diabetes, stroke and even some forms of cancer. A lack of movement also negatively impacts our general wellbeing, mood and ability to cope with stress. As an added benefit, if more of us shift our short trips to walking and biking, we\u0027ll decrease our fossil fuel use, which is also good for our pocketbooks and the environment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there any good news?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Yes! Glad you asked. I\u0027ve been a health promotion professional for over 27 years and about 10 years ago I started noticing an encouraging trend, an enhanced awareness emerging in the connections between public health and the built environment; more specifically, how the design of our communities either support or impede healthy human movement and what we refer to as a \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCulture of Activity\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy is a larger audience needed?\u003c/strong\u003e Ideally the desire and initiative to create healthier, more activity friendly places need to come from both the community members (residents) and it\u0027s leaders (politicians and administrators). Our goal therefore is to reach a broad audience, with positive, inspirational stories of change and transformation. There are some wonderful successes out there and we\u0027ll strive to profile some of the best of these in a compelling, entertaining and engaging way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will the money raised go toward?\u003c/strong\u003e All monies collected will go directly towards expenses associated with the filmmaking process. As a very quick example, our monthly cost for our film editing software package as a non-profit is $54 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre the monies really tax deductible?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes! We are a registered and recognized 501c3 not-for-profit organization so your contributions will, in most circumstances, be tax deductible. BTW The reason we are not offering tier rewards at this stage, is that as a non-profit, we\u0027d have to subtract the value of said award from your tax deductible amount. As always, check with your tax accountant or attorney if you have a unique situation and/or specific tax questions.\u003cbr\u003e"
