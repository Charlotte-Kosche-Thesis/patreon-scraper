    "summary": "Short story: I want to move to doing YouTube content creation full-time. That\u0027s impossible to do on $3 per day from ad revenue. I need your help to keep the channel alive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLong Story: Running a YouTube channel has become a full time job for me... Hours of editing after work until 4am, screening 1000\u0027s of comments each week while interacting with my viewers, not spending time with friends and family because I needed to film or upload. I\u0027ve always thought that\u0027s the way it should be. However, here\u0027s the catch. I already have a regular full time job outside of YouTube. Working 2 jobs has definitely taken it\u0027s toll on me and has now become completely unsustainable. I\u0027ve realised no matter how motivated someone is to succeed, the work involved in maintaining a YouTube channel is not sustainable when you add your \u0027real life\u0027 to the equation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe above was me in 2015. I opened this Patreon account in August 2015 however never made it public because I was too proud to ask for help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe below is me today\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been given an amazing opportunity...\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been made redundant which means I no longer have a Job or stable source of income however, out of every bad situation there is always a positive... I now have more time to dedicate to YouTube.\u00a0I\u0027m now at a crossroads of wanting to put more into my channel however still having financial responsibilities in my life outside of YouTube. The content is free on YouTube for you guys and always will be, however tips are very very much appreciated if you find value- add in the content I produce. \u003cbr\u003eThe money raised here will go towards bike maintenance, camera gear, cover the hours upon hours of editing.. Basically anything related to running the channel I\u0027m hoping to offset with the little money YouTubers make from Ad-Rev and what ever generous support comes through from the guys that have taken the extra step to throw a few dollars in my tip jar.\u00a0All supporters will get early access to my videos, patreon only content and priority messaging as you guys are helping me out in a HUGE way by sponsoring the channel.\u003cbr\u003e I can\u0027t thank you enough for helping to keep the AdjrianNickelodeon channel alive. Thanks Guys! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t help via Patreon that is totally, OK :) There are other ways you can help support the channel such as \u0027white listing\u0027 YouTube from your Ad-block, sharing my videos on your social media with your friends or in groups that you follow, or even just watching my content. Small things like this help in a HUGE way to ensure all content creators can continue to entertain us all on YouTube. Thanks again and enjoy the ride! \\(^_^)/"
