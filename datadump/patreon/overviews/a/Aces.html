I need your help to turn my story into basically a graphic novel. Patrons will be rewarded by gaining early access to comic pages immediately as they are finished, while everyone else must wait. Only half of the finished story will ever be published prior to its full completion. Furthermore, Patrons will have prioritized preferences for ideas to be in future chapters of the written story. If you have ideas, PM me on Aryion.com about them and mention you\u0027re a patron. I make no promises, but if you pay money, I\u0027m more likely to listen. :P\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe more money funneling into the project, the faster it can be finished.\u003cbr\u003e"
