    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAs an independent writer my goals in life are definitely tied to my ability to live as a writer. It\u0027s not easy to write, work a day job, and take care of every day responsibilities for me and Willow, my waifu. My goal here is to build a community around my writing that is accessible to all, but allows for my fans to help me live and gain experiences that help me grow as a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMajor influences on my writing style are video games like Borderlands, Metroid, Final Fantasy and oh so many more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorderlands adds a level of levity to the serious setbacks of a corporate dystopian future. They may be killing each other without a second thought, but there is an underlying reason why they became the way they are. This theme comes into play in small ways, lending more serious consideration to stories like Forming A System while Rey\u0027s growth and understanding of life causes her to take it less seriously as she moves forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMetroid lends serious consideration to solitary problem solving. Samus is rarely accompanied by much other than her ship. Story development comes from paying attention to detail, rather than specific cues that instill an idea into a reader\u0027s mind. You\u0027ll see much more of this in upcoming works!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinal Fantasy has been an inspiration since I was a kid. I\u0027ve played both FFXI and FFXIV, the MMORPG\u0027s that build massive worlds and entire communities around it.The Land of the Ley-Lines stories are heavily influenced by SquareEnix\u0027s love of crystals as a power source that makes explaining certain philosophical situations much easier by simplifying the actions required to portray it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a big fan of Ray Bradbury and his writing style. I\u0027ve read a few of his short stories in the book The Cat\u0027s Pajamas, which was the main inspiration for my Bartholomew series. It\u0027s a fun world to build and play with, especially when the fun is creating endings that are much less grand than Bartholomew ever hopes for!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI appreciate everyone who takes the time to read my work. It\u0027s a wonderful thing to live life and know there are people I\u0027ve never met that may have read and enjoyed my work without my even knowing it. The next step is to find those who enjoyed it so much they just had to let me know! Whether that\u0027s a comment, an e-mail, or by showing your support by subscribing, I will always appreciate those that take the time to tell me what they think of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for reading my Patreon page, and I hope my work can bring a little spark of inspiration to your day!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- Drew\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

At the end of the day, I just want to make people smile and think. How I go about doing that on a day to day basis is half the fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes, it\u0027s writing a small happy piece that I can pepper in some good feels with. It could be sharing another artist\u0027s work and how it\u0027s inspired me in my own work. Hell, it could just be a few jumbled lines that ran through my brain while waiting out the last hour of my shift at work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of what it is, there is fun to be had. Why not take this skill I\u0027ve honed over the last 8 years and use it to give people something to brighten their day? Heck, maybe I can make a living for myself doing it. To all of you that help support me in this endeavor, I promise to do my best to make you smile and think. Thank you for all of your support!",
