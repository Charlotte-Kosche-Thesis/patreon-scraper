     "about": "I am a 32 year old physically disabled woman who also suffers from multiple mental illnesses. I write about my experiences with them mainly through pop culture, because facing them directly and bluntly is a vicious and difficult beast. I have 4 cats, all certified as service animals (and capable off that title to various degrees and various means somehow), and I spend far too much time talking about them, dressing them up, and taking pictures of them. I also am a semi-active cosplayer, depending on how often I feel like being called a cripple to my face or how often I like being asked if my chair means I\u0027m the designated pack mule. (I really need to know better people, I\u0027m working on it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I survive on my Social Security Disability checks and some horribly underpaid freelance work, which is to say I\u0027m not really surviving much at all. Kind of a blow to one\u0027s self esteem, even if you\u0027ve been sick for as long as you can legitimately remember.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make good words, I know that I do, but I know that I can do so much better when I\u0027m not worrying about how I\u0027m going to pay this month\u0027s medical bills, when I\u0027m trying to figure out what medications I can safely go without to pay for this most recent surgery, let alone the last one. And that doesn\u0027t even think about all of the ER bills my ex kindly left me with from all of the times he got angry while trying to prove how much he loved me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, to put it in not nice terms that would make a baby cry, I gotta put myself out there or I\u0027m kinda fucked.\u00a0",
