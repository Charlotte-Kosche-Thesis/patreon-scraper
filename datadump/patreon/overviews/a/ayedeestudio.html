I have been drawing since I was a kid, and in the last few years I have really been pushing to get my work out to a much larger audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e My current project is my creator-owned series The Changeling. This series is written, drawn, colored, lettered and even printed by me! The story is about a girl who struggles between humanity and her newfound penchant for blood after she wakes up one night as a demon with no recollection of her past.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to The Changeling, I also paint, draw and create my own work! I create original concepts, as well as fan art! My methods of composition usually include hand drawn work that is digitally colored in Photoshop, or acrylic paint on canvas. I try to be as versatile as possible, and am always trying to learn new techniques and educate myself as I go! My art style is dark and creepy, but with a hint of cuteness to counterbalance. My storytelling style lends credit to The Twilight Zone, Clive Barker, and visceral, unflinching relentlessness in terms of subject matter. I like telling stories that make you think, and actually cause the viewer to react in one form or another.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to start this Patreon page to try to connect better with my existing fans and supporters, and hopefully pick up more along the way! I also want to give my artist endeavors a bit more of a structure than they currently have.
