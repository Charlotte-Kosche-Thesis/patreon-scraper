    "summary": "Right, hello, my name is Adrian Speed and I write books. You may also know me from one of my other creative projects, the webcomic Jayden and Crusader, the science-fiction comic book Privateer, or my web series In Search of England.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting books is, by it\u0027s own nature, an unpredictable way to make a living. Even the most prolific writers struggle to put out more than one or two books a year of any quality and even the best analysts in the industry cannot predict how well they will sell. This is why publishers give their authors an advance. The advance is a small sum of money based on the expected sales of the book and it helps spread an author\u0027s income throughout the year so they are not worrying about the rent while getting the next novel ready to publish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t have the backing of a publisher. It means that whenever I make a sale all the profits are my own (hurray) but it also means I only have an income while I\u0027m making sales (hurroo). This is where you, the patrons, come in. Your contributions here on Patreon act like my advance. A monthly donation as little as $1 per month ensures that I can continue writing books for you to enjoy without fear of having the lights go out or having to take extra shifts to make ends meet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will never stop working on novels or my other creative projects but without financial support of either patrons or publishers output will vary. Your patronage will directly ensure continued, regular releases.\u003cbr\u003e"
