Game Design/Campaign tips\u003cbr\u003e2. Live Character Builds influenced by/requested by Patrons\u003cbr\u003e3.

Building out a library of custom-content built for DMs and Players with fun in mind, and extending that ever-growing resource to each of my fellow gamers and enthusiasts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs this, like all things, is a work in progress, these ideas as well as their estimates may change as they become more possible.\u00a0 But that is a conversation for creator and Patrons.\u00a0 :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a more detailed analysis of what to expect, I urge you to take a look at my funding goals.\u00a0 Again, these are estimates, and only reality will tell what\u0027s really possible given my resources, but I\u0027m pretty sure we can do this without too many hitches. \u00a0;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by.\u00a0 Have an excellent day, and please continue to be awesome to one another.\u003cbr\u003e-Adamus Drake (DM\u0027s Den Master)\u003cbr\u003e"
