Not in a joking or funny \"ha-ha\" way, but more in a dumb, ignorant and morally repulsive way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we decided to start speaking out against two things that we felt strongly against: white supremacists and president Donald Trump.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo, we\u0027re not idiots who call everyone we don\u0027t agree with online \"racists.\" And, no, we don\u0027t think everyone who voted for Donald Trump is a racist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, at this stage in the game and with all the events that have transpired since the summer, we find it pretty hard to believe that anyone with a brain and even half a set of morals could support Trump and the garbage messages he keeps pushing (especially via social media and during his stump speeches at his pathetic rallies).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, that was where we decided to draw our line in the sand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe week we began speaking out against Trump we lost 30,000 of our 300,000 fans on Facebook. And we received a lot of hatemail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, after the first week of our political posts we started adding new fans who messages us to tell us they were really happy that we decided to take the stand that we did. And we added an additional 5,000 new fans to the page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe think an exchange of 30,000 angry jerks for 5,000 appreciative nice people is a more than a fair trade.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD I SUPPORT AFT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe started this Patreon page last year to help us cover the bills to continue making new content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, as the November 2016 got closer and after Trump was elected it became less and less fun to make content being consumed by a fanbase that had such a vociferous minority of bad apples watching it. And it was frustrating that many of these people didn\u0027t realize that most of our characters weren\u0027t supposed to be heroes that should be emulated, but instead they were kind of awful people you\u0027d probably try to avoid in real life (like Cartman on South Park).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese ridiculous characters had become a form of validation in some people\u0027s eyes that being an angry, hateful a-hole was cool in real life. Or, at least online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut we never felt that way nor intended our content to provide that type of validation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, we pretty much burned out on making new content and slowly stopped making new videos all together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow we\u0027re at a crossroads and we\u0027ve decided to launch and build a brand new YouTube channel and Facebook page featuring a batch of new toy-based comedy series that we\u0027re starting from scratch.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you think this sounds like a challenge but also really fun endeavor to be a part of, then we\u0027d ask that you\u0027d please join us in the pursuit of our new endeavor by supporting us here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DO I SUPPORT AFT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re asking our fans to kick in a buck a month to help up us launch our new channel and make new content for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you join our \"Minifigure Of The Month Club\" support level\u00a0we\u0027ll send you a new super hero or pop culture minibrick action figure each month as a reward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf monthly pledges aren\u0027t your thing you can also support us by buying some AFT merchandise in our online store at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shop.actionfiguretherapy.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eShopAFT.com\u003c/a\u003e.
