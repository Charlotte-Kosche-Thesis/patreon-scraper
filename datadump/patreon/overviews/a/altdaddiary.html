My name is Ryan Loveeachother and I\u0027m a melancholy millennial struggling with what it means to alter the American Dream to fit my inner father song. Each day, I cobble together an examination of the day\u0027s happenings. From dumpster-diving to in-law drama, marital mayhem to semi-sobriety, these are my uncensored confessions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs anyone living amidst torrent of 2017 can attest, our lives are crazy busy. All of us. Nevermind the spiel on the frenzy of\u00a0first-time fatherhood. Let\u0027s keep this short and sweet. In order to keep up the pace of my daily blogging, during the breakneck whirlwind of spraying off reusable Bum Genius diapers and all, I\u0027m asking for your support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsking for support is hard. But so it goes. Like anyone who\u0027s ever crowd-surfed knows: we must hold each other up. So, let\u0027s talk support. I\u0027m very strongly committed to keeping my diary space ad-free, clean of corporate noise. I\u0027m also committed to kicking capitalism in the pants, which means I believe you should be able to read The Alt Dad Diary for free. That said, if you support my practice of ballsy-honest writing and it\u0027s feasible for you, please consider supporting me in any amount. Your contributions allow me to collect a few minutes every day, sit down, and breathe my cerebral cymbal-crashing into words.\u003cbr\u003e"

This pay raise doesn\u0027t mean a lot more diary being produced. It means more focus, more calm.
