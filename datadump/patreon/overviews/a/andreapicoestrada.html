    "summary": "My name is Andrea Pico Estrada, and I\u0027m a nature/bird photographer from Florida. \u003cbr\u003e\nI always knew I had a passion for photography, but I never found my calling until I moved to Florida over seven years ago.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith its natural beauty, clear blue Gulf waters and skies filled with birds, I soon found my passion. Birds taught me patience and to slow down in life, and I found myself observing for hours on end, becoming a citizen scientist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor the first few years, I focused on the eagles of Florida, the third largest population in the United States. My daily routine was to get up early and spend every morning at the eagle nest from fall through spring and watch the cycle of life unfolding. I learned the depth of their parenting, their teamwork in building the nest and feeding the young, and documented their behaviors with thousands of photographs over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI can sense when the eagles arrive back from their summer migrations and a new sense of peace fills me when I see them soaring overhead.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eNot just eagles, I also adventured to the bird colonies off shore and became a contributor to Piping Plover observations, turning in my data every year when finding and photographing banded birds.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThese little birds fly as far as 3,000 miles each summer to reach their destination here in Florida. With thousands of shorebirds to capture my attention, much of my summer is spent watching babies being born, and the flying off with their parents a few months later. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith my Instagram daily photo journal I document my daily outings and bring to life nature and wildlife from the State of Florida.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eMy passion is to get people outside, to explore their surroundings, to join me on my daily adventure from wherever they are in the world. See my pictures, watch my videos and fall in love with nature the way I have.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m also dedicated to help you take pictures of your own, learning from my successes and mistakes, to get out there with the right gear and capture these amazing moments.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, I can take my love of birds and photography to the next level, reaching more remote locations and showcasing even more remote species. And I can spend more of my time sharing my techniques with you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003echeck out my daily photo journal on Instagram:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/andreapicoestrada/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/andreapicoestrada/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
