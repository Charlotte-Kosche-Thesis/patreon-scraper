With your support I will be able to spend more time making even better videos, I will be able to plan bigger projects \u0026amp; adventures, as well as replace broken gear.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMany of you guys have asked if there was a way to support me and be more involved. As an option for some of my biggest fans Patreon lets me show you guys a little bit more on a personal level, more behind the scenes, as well as keep you connected.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube\u00a0protection\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e. Lately YouTube has been doing some strange things such as failing to notify people \u0026amp; unsubscribing fans without their knowledge. There is no creator support or way to contact YouTube if there is a problem. Patreon allows me to have an exclusive platform to stay in contact with my greatest fans like you.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ol\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow Much Should I Support?\u003c/h3\u003eYou decide how much you want to support, as low as $1 a month. It is setup up as a monthly subscription and you will receive exclusive perks based on your choice of commitment. You can easily cancel at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan I Still Watch Your Videos Free?\u003c/h3\u003eYes, all the videos I put up on YouTube will always be free, in fact Patreon will allow me to improve the quality, consistency and variety of adventures I upload to YouTube. For example if i reach my second Patreon goal, i am going to do daily vlogs everyday for 30 days. Please do not feel obligated to pay, this is only for people who want to support and receive the bonus rewards I offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eCan I Stop My Subscription?\u003c/h3\u003eYes, if you decide it\u0027s not for you anymore, or money is tight, please feel more than free to opt out. You can always come back later if you want. Or don\u0027t if you don\u0027t. I promise I will still like you just as much as I already do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy Do You Make Videos?\u003c/h3\u003e I am making these videos because I love to share my adventures and teach people things that I learn. I am told by my subscribers that I put a smile on their face everyday and I want to continue making people happy. The subscription will help continue my passion towards my videos and adventures.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
