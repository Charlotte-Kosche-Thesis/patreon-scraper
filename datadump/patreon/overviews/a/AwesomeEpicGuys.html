    "summary": "Welcome to our Patreon! We are the two creators behind the YouTube channel AwesomeEpicGuys who create comedy videos about the PC game World of Tanks!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eCurrently we are probably most famous for our \"Another Day in World of tanks\" series. You can check out that playlist here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv2Atc7RcIxcpwqOwkOfv4m6yYpM1UwlB\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLv2Atc7RcIx...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do we even have a Patreon? Don\u0027t we make enough money of YouTube as it is?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube has during the last few years made changes to how we get to monetize our content. This affects almost all content creators across the platform. But generally speaking, advertisers have been scared off the platform and the adsense revenue creators get are just getting lower and\u00a0 lower. We might see some changes soon though! But who knows? Funny thing is. We made more money of YouTube back when we had 10k subs than now (51k when typing). That alone says alot. (More and more people using ad-block isn\u0027t making the situation any better)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if we are to do this for a living, or even at all, we need some income to pay our bills. So we as content creators need to look for alternative incomes and Patreon is one of them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho should donate to our work and why? First of all. If you are having problems paying your own bills at home, please don\u0027t pledge to us. Only pledge if you have some money to spare!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us you will get some sweet perks! You can read about them to the right! These might change from time to time but the higher support level, the more perks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t have money to pledge to us, but still want to support us somehow you can do some of the following: Like our videos! Leave comments on our videos! Share our videos with your friends and family! If you see sponsored links in our video description, just pressing them will help us out! If you are using ad-block you can either disable it or at least whitelist our channel. Ads make the internet free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to pledge to us. Welcome to our Patreon community! And thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e/ EdvinE20 \u0026amp; Zwhatsh, AEG.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://yt3.ggpht.com/a-/AJLlDp1SXfknbJG99KJ4TmuZ15iqzKBMOHZwgaV7yg=s900-mo-c-c0xffffffff-rj-k-no\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
