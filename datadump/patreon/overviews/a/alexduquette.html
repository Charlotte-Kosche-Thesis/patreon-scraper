I\u0027ve got to pay for audio equipment, software, instruments, etc. \u00a0And that\u0027s just for the audio side of things. \u00a0What about the other things? \u00a0Cameras, video software, hard drives, etc. \u00a0It adds up. \u00a0The higher quality material I provide, the more difficult it is to self-supply what I need in order to make everything happen. \u00a0Plus, I have a full time job which cuts into a lot of my time I could be using to create more content. \u00a0Ugh, now my heart is sad. \u00a0*Goes to watch 12 cat videos in a row*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there\u0027s a light at the end of the tunnel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SuawbBfPK1k/maxresdefault.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I believe very strongly in communities. \u00a0The great thing about communities is that every member has a common thread that bonds the group together. \u00a0Everyone is supportive of one another, just like one great big family. \u00a0And that\u0027s how I see my followers/fans. \u00a0That\u0027s how I see \u003cem\u003eyou.\u003c/em\u003e \u00a0You\u0027re family. \u00a0\u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e can help support me. \u00a0\u003cem\u003eYou\u003c/em\u003e can help my channel grow. \u00a0And most importantly, \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e can help me bring new ideas to life and allow me to fulfill my passion. \u00a0Patreon is the perfect way to make this happen. \u00a0And now I\u0027m here, five paragraphs in and one thousand typos later, asking for your consideration in supporting me. \u00a0Any funds I receive for the time being will go straight back into the material I create for you, allowing said material to get better and better. \u00a0That\u0027s not all. \u00a0Anyone who supports me will receive exclusive perks (Look at the side of this page for more details)! \u00a0And once I have enough support, I will cut back the hours at my day job to allow to produce more videos weekly. \u00a0I have full faith in my followers/fans. \u00a0I have full faith in \u003cem\u003eyou.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why \n\u003cem\u003eyou \u003c/em\u003emean so much to me. \u00a0You\u0027re willing to offer me what I need in order to keep fulfilling my passion. \u00a0You don\u0027t \u003cem\u003ehave\u003c/em\u003e to do it. \u00a0But you \u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e to. \u00a0That is such an outstanding thing to think about. \u00a0How can I ever repay you? \u00a0I give really nice back rubs. \u00a0I could re-paint the walls in your dining room. \u00a0Perhaps you could sway back and forth on a hammock while I hand feed you grapes. \u00a0Then again, maybe the best way to repay you is to keep delivering increasingly improved content. \u00a0Yeah. \u00a0I think I\u0027ll do that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B_kx084M33Q/maxresdefault.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, I better be going. \u00a0This video isn\u0027t going to edit itself! \u00a0I appreciate your time and genuinely hope to see you again soon. \u00a0Feel free to contact me through my various social media accounts with any questions, thoughts, or concerns. \u00a0Until then, make sure to eat your vegetables and forever fill your days with music by yours truly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Alex\u003cbr\u003e"
