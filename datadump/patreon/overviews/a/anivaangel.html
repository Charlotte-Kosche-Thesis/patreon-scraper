    "summary": "Hello Lovelies!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne morning, when I was fifteen years old, I woke up and said to myself \"I want to write a book.\" Since then, writing has been my passion and my life. For a long time, I struggled with keeping focus on one story at a time. I would write five or six chapters in one story, then get a new idea and work on that story, ignoring the first one (as far as writing problems go, I would rather have too many ideas than not enough). However, ten years later, I have finally managed to wrangle my focus enough to write and publish my first book, \u003cem\u003eHidden Identity\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0which is now available on Amazon and Kindle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love writing, and I would like nothing better than to sit and write all day long, perfecting my ideas, and turning them into reality. Life, however, is not that kind. Unfortunately, there are bills to pay, and groceries to buy, and writing, alone, cannot cover everything at this time. That is why I am creating this page, so that I can get to a point where my writing can support me, and I can spend more time producing more stories for you, my dear readers. My first goal is set to help me pay off my student loans. Once that goal is reached, then I will add another bill to my goal and so on. In return for your help, I promise to write a Patreon exclusive short story every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved fairy tales and fantasy stories, and read as much of them as I can. Those stories are a huge influence on my writing. I love reading about faeries from all around the world, and incorporating them into my stories (though I do have my favorites, such as Elves and Dragons, that I use more than others). My favorite authors are C.S. Lewis, J. R. R. Tolkien, and Gail Carson Levine. Their books are what awakened my love of writing. If you enjoy any of those authors, chances are high that you will enjoy my work as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a thank you for those who choose to support me, I offer the following rewards:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 month will get you access to my Patreon exclusive feed where you can read all the stories I post.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$3 a month will get you the above, plus a special shout-out at the end of the next month\u0027s story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Pledge $5 a month, and, in addition to the above, you will get a special clue as to what the next month\u0027s story will be about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $10 a month, and you will receive a personalized \"thank you\" from one or more of my characters, as well as everything listed above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $25 a month, and you will earn a special Q\u0026amp;A session with me over Skype or Facebook and everything listed above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledge $50 a month, and you will get everything above, plus the honor of suggesting either a prompt or a character to be featured in a future story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, if you pledge $100 a month, you will receive everything above, plus I will write you a personalized story to be published on my Patreon feed. You can give me as many or as few details as you wish, so long as they do not conflict with my personal moral or ethical values or Patreon\u0027s guidelines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to everyone who has pledged, or will pledge, or even who thought about pledging. I cannot do this without do.\u00a0"
