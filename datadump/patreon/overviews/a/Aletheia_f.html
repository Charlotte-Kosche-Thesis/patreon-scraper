It\u0027s a decentralised and distributed \ndatabase used as a publishing platform for scientific research.\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, Aletheia is software. But software without people is nothing. To \ncomprehensively answer the question what is Aletheia, Aletheia is \nsoftware surrounded by a community of people who want to change the \nworld through open access to scientific knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor a more in depth explanation, Aletheia is an Ethereum Blockchain \napplication utilising IPFS for decentralised storage that anyone can \nupload documents to, download documents from, that also handles the \nacademic peer review process. The application runs on individual PCs, \nall forming part of the IPFS database. This gives us an open source \nplatform that cannot be bought out by the large publishers (and any \nderivatives of the platform source code must also be open source) that \nshould also be hard to take down due to database nodes being spread \nacross the globe in multiple legal jurisdictions. Aletheia is designed \nto be a resilient platform run transparently by the community, not some \nblack box corporation or editorial board, meaning all users can see the \ndecisions Aletheia is making and have a stake in that decision making \nprocess if they so desire. By this nature, Aletheia is decentralised, it\n has no key person risk. Should the core group who invented Aletheia \ndisappear Aletheia won\u0027t cease to exist, it will continue to be run by \nthe community. The community moderates content through various \nmechanisms (peer review, reputation scores etc.,) to ensure quality of \ncontent.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn keeping with our notions of openness and transparency we have \ndesigned our rewards with those principles in mind. We aren\u0027t fans of \npaywalls, so we have not opted to go the common route of making \nexclusive blog posts and videos. The idea is, if you unlock a tier by \npaying for it, you\u0027ve unlocked it for everyone, as practical as that is \nfor the given tier. Really this is great though, as with your financial \ncontribution you will be supporting the development of decentralised \nopen source software, you will be supporting yourself in receiving \nsomething, and you\u0027ll be supporting the entire community around \nAletheia. At the end of the day helping people is what we\u0027re all about. \nThe rule of common sense applies here as well, if you unlock a tier and \npull support, no hard feelings, the volunteer community will need to \nmake a call on if it\u0027s still feasible for that tier to be fulfilled \ngiven  Aletheia commitments along with study/work/everything else our \nincredible volunteers juggle in their day to day lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur current prototype:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vUyjEmcVSFA\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
