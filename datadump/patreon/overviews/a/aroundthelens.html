    "summary": "My name is David J. Murphy and I, along with my co-host Zach D. Roberts, create a weekly podcast devoted to the discussion of visual journalism. Each week we break down news, topics and gear related to photojournalism and documentary filmmaking with 1-3 additional panelists from the profession. We\u0027ve had many notable figures on our show who represent the career field and news related to our field to include Eros Hoagland, Stacy Pearsall, Rick Friedman and Mark Schierbecker among others. Each week we try to have someone new. With your support we hope to be able to devote time to not only creating more shows, but also helping to make www.aroundthelens.com an educational and information hub for all things visual journalism related. Thanks for your support.\u00a0"

It takes time and energy to make the show happen on a weekly basis and it\u0027d be great to be compensated for that time monetarily. By earning at least $100 a month it would prove that there are people out there who believe in the show enough to invest in it monetarily and give Zach and I the additional drive and time to make it even better. Some ideas we\u0027d like to use the money towards include a custom intro and outro music, an animated logo, and better live-feed production values.\u00a0",
