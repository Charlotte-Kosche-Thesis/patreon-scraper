My alias is known as AniDrewit, and up until recently was AnDrew19787.\u003cbr\u003eDrawing was something I wasn\u0027t as intensively into during childhood as other artists who were, but I had my own fun writing stories and drawing comics. Later on I learned to draw and started writing and animating as well, and soon it became something I wanted to do!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI took a course in VFX and Animation and worked some of the way into the industry, however doing so gives me less time and energy to work and improve on my own content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eSimply put, it\u0027s a crowd-funding site like Kickstarter or Indiegogo, except you are supporting individual artists on a monthly or per-creation basis. You do not need to make an account to become a Patron, only a PayPal account or a credit card!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelp support me in making my own creations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvery little bit helps! The extra money will go towards bills, equipment, software, and help out friends! (Maybe hire people for projects or attend courses if I get enough).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecoming a Patron is optional\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCompleted content like art and animations will be available for free, but with your help those things can be released more often!\u003cbr\u003e"
