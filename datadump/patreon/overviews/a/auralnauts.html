    "summary": "We\u0027ve been making comedy and musical content on Youtube nearly four years. People seem to enjoy it, and we\u0027d like to keep doing it. We\u0027d also like to do it more frequently. Right now we\u0027re at a crossroads. It\u0027s getting more and more difficult to make a living off of Youtube when a video contains copywritten material. The studios don\u0027t care if we use their material to make parodies, because once we release it, they get to step in and claim all of the ad revenue that our videos generate, leaving us with nothing. It\u0027s keeping us from the dream of doing Auralnauts full time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have suggested that we should set up a Patreon page and ask our fans to support our work, so here we are! If you want more Auralnauts, more parodies, more original music, more kill counts, more top ten improvements, more Star Wars, more of whatever it is we did that turned you into a fan, then become a patron and show Youtube we don\u0027t need their ad pennies. We have so many ideas and projects we\u0027d like to pursue, we just need the time and resources to pursue them. In addition to what you\u0027ve come to expect, this also includes original projects, apps, games, podcasts, etc. With enough help, we will quit our jobs and spend our time making Auralnauts stuff until we die."
