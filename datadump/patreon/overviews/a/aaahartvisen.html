    "summary": "There are few words that can fully encapsulate the essence of my good friend Aasgar. I met him and his wife about three years ago online, and they are a daily inspiration to me. We are finally getting around to giving him an outlet for his prolific works of writing. He is able to write, edit, and format about 1000 words a day, which may seem to be an exaggeration, but he is truly a linguistic savant. He is a published comparative philologist who translated the diagrams for Lausanne University\u0027s phonetics manual. He also holds a bachelor\u0027s degree from Eastern Oregon University in Spanish, Psychology, Sociology, and Anthropology where he graduated Summa Cum Laude.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 He has also suffered from an undiagnosed nerve condition for over 17 years. At this point his condition is improving enough to resume writing at a fever pitch. A platform like Patreon seems to be the perfect showcase for his academic mastery, wit, and creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is a sample of his writing. This would be broken up into two Works of about 2000 words each. Overall he will be creating a mixture of fiction, mystification, poetry, and non-fiction commentary. Thank you for your consideration and patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Cavin DeJordy\u003cbr\u003eCaretaker, Manager, and Publisher:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
