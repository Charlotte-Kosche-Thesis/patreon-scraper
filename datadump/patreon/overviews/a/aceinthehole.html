I\u0027m Taryn! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere wasn\u0027t a lot of information or space on the internet for asexual people when I first started learning about asexuality, so I wanted to create one. I\u0027m an asexual biromantic femme with a serious chocolate problem and an emotionally needy cat. I write about asexuality, sex toys, navigating how to be ace when your partner isn\u0027t, and lots and lots of search engine optimization. Because most people have websites these days, and I want to help you be found on the internet!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a Patron, you have my unending thanks. Your support helps me create a space to talk about how asexuality and sex can coexist (or not!) as well as helping sex writers use SEO to their advantage in a world that makes many social media outlets more restrictive for sex writers and educators than the typical population.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurious about the donation tier names? Well, when presented with the option of sex or cake, many asexuals would choose cake. It\u0027s become the unofficial symbol of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://wiki.asexuality.org/Cake\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAVEN network\u003c/a\u003e as well. So, cake!"
