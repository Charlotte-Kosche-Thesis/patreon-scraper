    "summary": "Greetings! Welcome to my Patreon page and thank you for your interest in this continuing project of growth and discovery.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Aaron Frey, and I create the videos on the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjeIYZeO5jmTCC_eQ4JPPQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAaron So Far\u003c/a\u003e page on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjeIYZeO5jmTCC_eQ4JPPQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube\u003c/a\u003e. The first reason I have for doing Aaron So Far is that it has bugged me for so long that I \u003cem\u003ewasn\u0027t\u003c/em\u003e doing it--ever since my days as a full-time parish pastor. I had thought videos like this would be a great way for churches to spread their message.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was surprised, then, when, after I resigned from the full-time ministry years ago, the bug didn\u0027t go away. But it was no longer a bug about creating an outreach tool for a particular congregation. It was about how badly the\u00a0marketplace of ideas needs intellectually honest, Biblically conservative voices that don\u0027t close out every discussion with, \"God says it\u00a0and I believe it.\" I mean, okay, but \u003cem\u003ewhy\u003c/em\u003e does that settle it for you? And why do you think that should end the discussion for anyone else?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn other words, I saw no dissonance between intellectual honesty and believing in the God who has revealed himself in detail through the Old and New Testament prophets. In fact, I found that everyone who claimed some sort of superior position or system\u00a0was assuming truths based on ideas that were no more intelligent or honest than my own--so there was plenty more to discuss!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut that gives me no authority to say that I know better than anyone else. That\u0027s why the \"So Far\" is so essential. We are all flawed in deep, deep ways, even when we\u0027re being as honest as we think we can be. We must always be ready for correction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDo you think the marketplace of ideas needs a voice\u00a0like that? Then I hope you\u0027ll help to support me so that I can make this old, old urge my full-time work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eAaron, do you math?\u003c/h4\u003eWhat do you mean, \"Do I math?\" Are you referring to the fact that a person could get Producer level rewards but cut their support off at one video per month? Are you wondering if I was unaware that such a person could support me with no more money than someone at the base level supporting 10 videos at $1 each but still get all the Producer rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, I math, and I\u0027m perfectly fine with that situation. If you want all the rewards but only want to support one video a month, I still think that level of commitment should be heavily recognized. It means that if I or one of my children are really sick and I fall behind on video output, I still have decent support from some committed individuals. I think that\u0027s great and I\u0027m more than happy to scrawl your name onto the end of a video even if you can only afford one video a month at that level. Produce away!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a matter of fact, it was for this exact reason that I chose to ignore the general Patreon rule for being a per-video creator versus a per-month creator. If you\u0027re creating more than four things a month, Patreon suggests that you have a per-month campaign versus a per-creation campaign. That makes sense, and I understand the point of this general rule, but I didn\u0027t like that I had to choose one over the other instead of leaving the choice to you, my supporters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you like the idea of supporting me monthly in order to make my income stream more predictable, choose your level of support and set the limit of support at\u00a0one video a month. I think that\u0027s awesome. I would be very grateful both for the added stability and for the show of confidence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if you like the idea of motivating me to produce videos quickly (I know I like that!), then choose a lower amount of per-video support and set the maximum at 10 or 15 videos per month. I want to make a minimum of 2 videos a week with an occasional bonus video, but keeping up that pace won\u0027t be easy. I appreciate the motivation of a per-video system. Plus, it feels like you\u0027re keeping me \"honest,\" and my conscience likes that!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eGoals\u003c/h4\u003eI encourage you to click through the goals on the left side of the page. I\u0027ve been through a variety of employment situations since I resigned from pastoral ministry in 2010, but they all qualify as un- or under-employment. Sadly, that was a common story in the economy of this part of Michigan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it\u0027s good news for this campaign!\u00a0I know very well how to live on the bare necessities and don\u0027t mind working hard while doing it. That\u0027s why I\u0027m willing to commit to two years of video production with no income other than my Patreon support at $250 per video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd what if I get more? Well, that will, of course, be good for my family, their education accounts and my eventual retirement. But what if it gets even bigger? What if you keep sharing the videos, and that results in more and more people considering the support of them worthwhile? Then I would like to expand their application into other areas. For instance, They could be customized into packages for local churches to support their membership classes. Or particular areas of the video library could be expanded and turned into a flipped-classroom Bible classes on a variety of topics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI guess my point here is, keep sharing. If there is great support out there for videos like these, we\u0027ll never know about it unless these videos find the people who would be willing to support them. And if it turns out that there is a lot of them, then we\u0027ll all be sitting on this page discussing what that means and how else these videos can help. That sounds good to me, and I hope it sounds good to you!"
