    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eHi and thank you for taking the time to view my patreon. This platform is where you can support my creative endeavors, and in \nreturn you\u0027ll receive exclusive perks every month. The subscription is \nmonthly and at beginning or end of each month you\u0027ll receive new original content from me.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Aaron Anderson and I am a fine art film photographer looking to forward my artistic and professional endeavors with this craft. I currently reside in south Georgia and mainly work in state but I am looking to expand my reach and clientele. For those of you who do not know who I am, Here\u0027s a short run down of my history with photography. I originally got into photography \u003cbr\u003ein high school when I wanted to explore new mediums of art. I began with a android phone (I know surprising right?), working my way to a DSLR, specifically a canon 60D, and man did I love that camera. I shot a massive amount of work with that camera for about 4 years and then I made the decision to switch formats and shoot film. Which, I fell madly in love with and have been shooting ever since. I shoot fine art photos and I spend most of my time expressing inner dialogues and feelings I wish to express. I am mostly known for my work containing a lot of emotion, as well as, capturing my subjects in a very nostalgic, and delicate way.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePhotography for me is an outlet to express so much that goes on in my head and in my heart. I speak very softly, yet very boldly through my photos and I want to be able to sustain myself financially so I can explore this craft, along with, the career opportunities. If you are a supporter of my work then Patreon gives you the opportunity to express that support by helping me with things like living costs, development costs, and most of all, allowing me to grow freely as an artist. Which in turn, gives me the chance to support you back. You will get access to tons of exclusive content by subscribing to my Patreon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTake a look below at all of the tiers and each of their rewards. You will see a slew of affordable options that allow you to receive many exclusive behind the scenes looks, prints, and even my own original negatives. I honestly just want an opportunity to grow as an artist and do what I actually love for a living. Also, this gives me the opportunity to give back to my true supporters. So, please do keep in mind that that is mainly what your support will be allowing to take place. Thank you so much in advance. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLASTLY, If you have any questions feel free to message me here! \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
