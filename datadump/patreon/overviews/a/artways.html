     "about": "Tomaquag Museum was established in 1958 by Eva Butler, an anthropologist, with the guidance of the late Princess Red Wing (Narragansett/Wampanoag), and is Rhode Island\u2019s only museum entirely dedicated to telling the story of the Indigenous Peoples of this land. Tomaquag, located in historic Arcadia Village in Exeter since the early 70\u2019s, is also the only Rhode Island museum operated by Indigenous people. It originated in Tomaquag Valley, a hamlet inside the village of Ashaway in the town of Hopkinton, RI.\u003cbr\u003e\nThe Museum has a unique collection of over 20,000 cultural objects along with hundreds of thousands of pieces of archival materials focusing on the Indigenous peoples of New England and Rhode Island. The Museum is well-respected among Rhode Island\u0027s and New England\u0027s cultural museums, and is visited each year by researchers, students, and travelers from across the United States and throughout the world. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static.squarespace.com/static/52c6cfe3e4b02b1e85cae962/t/54ad9982e4b0c95969c55af6/1420663200068/Curator+explaining+Basket+Designs.jpeg?format=1000w\u0026amp;storage=local\" style=\"width: 227px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRegular visits by Native professionals, artists, storytellers and others add many perspectives to each visitor\u0027s discovery of the world at Tomaquag. Our special programs share Native perspectives on traditional health and well-being, education, history, technologies, culture and the Indigenous arts. Tomaquag hosts classes on beadwork, pottery, weaving, painting among others.\u003cbr\u003e\n Presentations for the public through our offsite programs, lectures, and cultural presentations bring our culture, traditional arts, and history to the public at large. Tomaquag\u2019s unique educational programs include specialized tours, Native games, Indigenous foods, Ecology of Mother Earth and Eastern Woodland Slide Presentations, Educator\u0027s Workshops, conferences, books and curricula on contemporary issues and events.\n\u003cbr\u003e",
