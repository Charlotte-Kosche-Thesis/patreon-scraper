It\u0027s a game that\u0027s been in development off-and-on for almost 5 years, using the \u003cstrong\u003eRAGS\u003c/strong\u003e text adventure game engine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can play Cursed \u003cem\u003eright now! \u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://anonymousmangames.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCheck out my blog\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0for the latest updates on the game and the most recent version. You will need the RAGS Suite,\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.ragsgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ewhich can be downloaded for free here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0(use version 2.4.16).\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis game isn\u0027t like other adult games, or at least, I don\u0027t want it to be. It\u0027s not about sex, adult situations or fetishes. This is a game about daily life. About stepping into some high heels when you\u0027ve never worn them before. There\u0027s certainly adult situations and sex, but it\u0027s not the focus, just another aspect of the life that you\u0027re leading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe overarching plot of the game requires you to deal with a powerful woman who either wants to make your life hell, or use you to make her life better. The interactions with this woman drive the game, as although you might want to mind your own business, she won\u0027t let you. On top of that, you have to deal with a your job, meeting new people, your previous life, and exactly how you\u0027re going to make your rent payment this month. Maybe you\u0027ll find love, maybe you\u0027ll end up on the street, maybe you\u0027ll clock some time in jail. Good choices, bad choices, saint, sinner, millionaire or paycheck-to-paycheck. It\u0027s up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTransformation themes abound in the game, with the ability to change your body first and foremost. But you\u0027ll also be able to change people you meet. And actions have consequences, so don\u0027t be surprised if that one-night stand turns into something more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe game is \u003cstrong\u003efree\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to download from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://anonymousmangames.blogspot.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog,\u003c/a\u003e and will always be so: I don\u0027t believe in trapping content behind a paywall of any sort.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe game has been in development, as I said, for almost five years, but as it has never really been a major money-maker, it constantly takes a backseat to other projects and responsibilities, such as my job. There\u0027s no funding for this project: I\u0027m a one-man development team, and I\u0027m making this whether it\u0027s paid for or not. Some fans has expressed a desire to support development, and everyone likes getting paid for their time and effort, so...Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, I would like to note that \u003cstrong\u003eregardless of any contributions or payments received, I will still be working on completing this game.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI like to believe that people will support a creator that makes something they love, if they can. If you choose to support my efforts to make this and other games, then I thank you sincerely. With the game already half completed as of this writing, there is not much that can be offered in terms of individual rewards, as new content is constantly in development as it is, and there is a lot of planned content. Rewards may materialize later (in which case I will make them retroactive), but at this time, I don\u0027t have much to offer other than my thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about Patreon or the game itself, please contact me through one of the various options listed on my blog. You can also post in the game\u0027s semi-official forum. I do enjoy talking about the game and the engine that it is built on, and knowing that people enjoy it is a very special reward.\u003cbr\u003e"
