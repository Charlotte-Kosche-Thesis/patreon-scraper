I just want to say \u0027Thank you\u0027 in forward for trusting me on guiding you along the way of your career.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I do this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter being an international DJ and producer for over ten years and experiencing the music industry myself, from being a newbie to being a professional artist, puts me the unique position to help out artists from my own experiences. After those ten years of building my career and network, I ended up in a burnout. In this period I started to find my way in life and decided to switch things up. I wasn\u0027t happy being an artist myself but I did like helping people out using my\u00a0experience, network and knowledge. I took the best of both worlds and created a new job for myself, artist coach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I do this?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create videos, podcast episodes and write blogs to send out my content. Think about music production tutorials, talks with music industry professionals and tips and tricks to get your career to the next level. The reason why I create video, audio and written content is that I believe everyone is consuming content in a different way. Find your favorite one and have fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe it goes without saying that I would greatly appreciate your financial support. I\u0027ll say it anyway though. \u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e. I really appreciate it. The Patreon model has us place rewards here to entice you to donate, but if we\u0027re both honest... you\u0027re here because you understand what I\u0027m trying to do with Artist Coaching, and you think the 100+ hours I put into all the content is worth it! You \"get it\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoey\u003cbr\u003eArtist Coach"
