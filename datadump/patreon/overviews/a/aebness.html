    "summary": "I am a full time musician, fire performer, producer and educator based in Los Angeles. I love what I do so much I have to force myself to chill sometimes and not just constantly obsessively create. I love to create, to bring people together and to share my passion and life experiences to fill the world with stronger people through music, art, fire, flow or wherever I can help light a spark.\n\u003cbr\u003eMy track record is solid.. I\u2019ve been gigging professionally since the age of 12, playing in jazz combos, orchestras, world music groups and rock bands throughout the northeast region. I relocated to LA in 2008, added fire performance, electronic music and yoga to my skill set and proceeded to dive into the west coast scene. Since then I\u2019ve recorded on dozens of albums, releasing 2 under my own name, played with numerous rock n roll hall of famers, had my music used by multiplatinum artists and in major network TV shows, taught 100\u2019s of kids through out the LA area from the most elite schools to the outreach programs for underprivileged youth, and\u00a0through an unexpected series of events have been able to help a number \nof former addicts and ex con\u0027s turn their lives around and find a \npositive path in the world.\u003cbr\u003eAs someone in the entertainment industry, especially in LA, I am often asked what my dream is. The best distillation I can describe to you is that I want to see how great of music I can make working with the best of the best, and I want to have a positive cultural/social impact. For the last few years I have been realizing this dream, watching it unfold around me. Musically I have been blessed with the opportunities to work with legendary artists, whilst watching my peers and collaborators rise to the top and earn their stripes alongside me with chart topping songs and Grammy\u2019s. On the social and cultural front I have been honored to directly connect with local kids on a regular basis and become trusted counsel and life coach to folks of all walks of life looking to set a new course or overcome major hurtles. I feel my dream is fully in action and I just want to keep cultivating.\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is my current dilemma\u2026 while making a living as an independent artist and educator has come quite naturally to me, it is a constant hustle in which the market has more control than I do over what I am creating. My intent with patreon is simple: to be able to shift my focus towards the projects that are extremely meaningful and have the most long term value and potential, rather than being required to always choose the ones with the check that ensures my rent is paid regardless of how meaningful the project is. This is where your patronage makes a world of difference.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome examples of current projects you\u2019d be directly supporting:\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecording music with empowering themes with The Doors guitarist Robby Krieger to benefit St. Jude\u0027s\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMusical therapy sessions offered to recovering addicts, cancer patients, and trauma victims (and anyone else who may benefit!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRecording an album of electronic/world/pop infused music with Grammy Nominated Engineer/Producer Johannes Raassina\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInteractive experiences being offered in schools to inspire and motivate the next generation to be creative and self directed\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProducing a documentary on artists who push boundaries\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCreating ambient musical meditations\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThese projects are all well underway and the ideas for what do next to make the world a brighter place are endless. I am collaborative, inclusive and doing this work fills me with boundless energy that just seems to multiply the more I do. I will see these projects through no matter what, but if you find yourself inspired enough by what you see here to chip in a little it will help them happen sooner and possibly better. It will give you access to fun things like early releases, special events and creative gifts from myself and my collaborators to you. If your money is tight I understand, please soak in all that I\u2019m up to, enjoy it, comment on it, share it and if I\u2019m doing my job right you\u2019ll feel a little tickle of inspiration lighting you up."
