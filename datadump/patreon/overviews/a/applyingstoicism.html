I have been practicing and writing on this subject for nearly five years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI owe who I am today to a purely accidental discovery of\nEpictetus\u0027s Enchiridion several years ago. I have tried to incorporate Stoic\nprinciples into my every spoken word, thought, and action since. In addition, I\ncommitted myself to writing down my thought processes with the intention to one\nday help others. The conditions under which I write are: Writing for show is\nforbidden, and my writing must mirror a real approach i\u0027ve taken to a relevant\nsituation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA great amount of Stoic material has been lost to\ntime, negligence, and destruction. I take the understanding of the application\nof Stoicism as seriously as I do because I aim to discover what may have been\nlost and commit it to writing. I intend to accomplish this through diligent\nreflection, application, and reference to surviving Stoic texts. I believe that\nit is my duty to try, even if the attempt may be considered controversial.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMany Stoics were prolific\u00a0writers,\nand that is what I aim to be. It\u0027s my preference that my writing\nbecomes my full-time work and enables me to make a living. Whether or not that\never comes to be, I intend to keep my writings always freely available to\nothers. If it helps even one person, I have accomplished what I sought to do.\u003cbr\u003e"
