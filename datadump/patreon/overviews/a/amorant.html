    "summary": "Hell and welcome to my Patreon page! If you\u0027re here that means you really enjoy my writing or some magic was involved in you finding me. Either way, let me introduce myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome stuff about me. My name is Amber Morant and I\u00a0write grimdark, epic, and dungeonpunk fantasy. Currently, I have a few anthologies with other authors out there and a serial novel Kalla where George RR Martin and X-men had a baby and it was this awesome piece of literary work. If you are still here, then welcome to the club of readers and fans I like to call my Dragons because of how great you all are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I was little, I wanted to become a full-time writer. Not necessarily\u00a0Rowling or Martin big but enough to where I could wake up in the morning, and sit back and write without having to go to another desk job. My life is filled with books, and even my son loves to read books, so writing what we both love would be the best thing for my family.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am working on a novel called \"The Bastard\u0027s Price\"\u00a0 and \"Shadow of the Crown\" to be published with both names pending. Both of these are dungeonpunk\u00a0and with each chapter completed, I will upload it on here along with any short fiction pieces that I also will be writing for exclusivity here each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what is dungeonpunk?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou all have seen me mention this a few times, but for those unaware, dungeonpunk\u00a0is a sub-genre\u00a0of steampunk. It is usually set in a modern or near future setting where magic has evolved so much that it looks like science. Instead of the police shooting bullets, there may be elemental spells aimed right at you and that car is powered by water elementals versus fuel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYou can find me on \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/author.ambermorant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ambermorant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"http://www.wattpad.com/user/AMorant\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWattpad\u003c/a\u003e, and my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ambermorant.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
