Usually these people are naked. By becoming my patron you can help me continue to shoot naked people and help me actually make a living as an artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nA little about me:\u003c/strong\u003e I have been shooting models for about five years and taking pictures of various other kinds for a lot longer than that. It started in 1996 when I got my first little \u003cdel\u003eshitty\u003c/del\u003e Sony Cybershot digital camera. I mean, it was nice for what it was but it was 1996 and digital was still finding it\u2019s feet. I used the little bugger to take pictures of nature, or walls, or walls covered in nature, the occasional nature covered in walls\u2026 you get the idea. I\u2019d turn these images into backgrounds for websites or textures or whatnot, yay photoshop. Now I shoot nude art, which is better. (Hey look, I totally just tried to make the case for my bonafides, \u003cem\u003ewow\u003c/em\u003e, hopefully I didn\u2019t sound \u003cem\u003etoo\u003c/em\u003e much like a pompous ass.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo yeah, join up and see my art, \u003cstrong\u003euncensored\u003c/strong\u003e as it should be. There are exclusives here you won\u2019t see anywhere else and I try to post the occasional behind the scenes shot and whatever other goodies I can think of. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for supporting my work and helping me get better and better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can find my website here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://apgibson.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eapgibson.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can buy prints of my work here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://shop.apg.photo/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshop.apg.photo\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m on Instagram:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/lieslimited\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003einstagram.com/lieslimited\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
