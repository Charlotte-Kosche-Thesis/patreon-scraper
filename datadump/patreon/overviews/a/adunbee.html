    "summary": "I wrote it down, so if I forgot to say it in the video, you would still know everything I had to say. Thank you so much for the support so far, and let\u0027s KEEP ON ROCKING!!!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy biggest dream is to be able to live off of making YouTube videos and playing guitar \u2013 and by helping and supporting me here, you help me make that dream come true. And for that I\u2019m so grateful. \nRegardless of you wanting to be a Patreon or not, it\u2019s really important to me that you all know how grateful I already am for getting all the messages about how I inspire you, or that my videos make you happy and smile both on good days and on bad days, or that you keep sending in all kinds of song requests that challenges me as a guitar player as well as it widens my musical specter in terms of what I listen to. \nTogether we discover music, learn to play so many awesome songs, and we, as a group, create this happy and supportive community of people who loves music. Supporting both instrumentalists, vocalists, hardcore headbangers or just the casual listener; it\u2019s a community of support to all people, and that means so much to me.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made my first YouTube video as a challenge to myself in hope of getting more comfortable playing in front of people. I had never played in front of anybody (not even my family) at the time, and the idea was to make 1 singe video, just to see how it would go. I recorded the sound by putting my headset on top of my computers microphone, while I filmed on the web camera. I was shaking the whole time I recorded because I was so nervous with the thought of actually preforming in front of people. Now, six years later, I am where I dreamed I once could get; I love playing more and more every single day, all kinds of music inspire me and I adore playing in front of people. All this because of the challenges, the musical happiness and confidence the YouTube community gave me as I grew as a guitarist, as well as I grew as a person.   \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll this I want to give back to people I know might struggle down the road or that are having a hard time right now, because having someone supporting you and giving you happiness in a time of need can mean the biggest difference in your life \u2013 I know, because you gave me just this when I was the one who needed it. For that, I need you to know that I am so grateful and that this community means so much to me. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! This is why I\u2019m now introducing METALSUNDAY 2.0, an extra METALSUNDAY once a month for Patreons to see, as a way of me saying thank you for helping me making my YouTube dream come true. The song will be a group decision, and everyone can vote for which song out of 3 they want to see. The song will be posted 30 minutes before the usual METALSUNDAY the last Sunday of the month. I really hope you will join me on this journey, and thank you all for the amazing support so far \u2013 ROCK ON!!  \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love, Adunbee."
