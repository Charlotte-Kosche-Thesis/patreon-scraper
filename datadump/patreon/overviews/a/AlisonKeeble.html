    "summary": "I have felt compelled to write since I was a child. \u00a0I used to write poetry, started a novel and even wrote and illustrated a cartoon strip before I hit double figures. \u00a0In my twenties I wrote more poetry, some of which was included in anthologies and I started to get paid for some magazine articles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I hit thirty, cancer hit me. \u00a0It had a profound emotional impact, more than a physical one and I stopped writing for quite a while. \u00a0In my late thirties, the cancer returned and oddly my creativity came back with it. \u00a0As I healed physically I decided to start an online sewing business,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.fromragstobags.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFrom Rags To Bags\u003c/a\u003e, selling handmade handbags initially and then quickly diversifying into homewares. \u00a0I started blogging to promote the business and realised my compulsion to write hadn\u0027t left me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWorking at the day job and sewing and promoting my products in my spare time didn\u0027t actually leave much time for writing though and even the blog took a back seat. \u00a0I have to admit my homewares have been far more successful that I could have imagined but my heart still lies in writing, if I am honest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite my early success at selling some articles, somewhere along the way I lost confidence. I have a lot of writing that is 90% written, including a couple of books. \u00a0I made excuses to myself about lack of time, not knowing where to go to find an editor or publisher. \u00a0Not knowing how to self publish on Amazon. \u00a0 Nothing really insurmountable, just excuses. \u00a0 In reality, I didn\u0027t want to face rejection and criticism of my work. \u00a0It was easier not to try, than to fail.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t live a life of regret though. I have to put myself out there. \u00a0I have to try and perhaps fail but I may also succeed. \u00a0Patreon is my first faltering step. \u00a0I know I can sew but can I write? \u00a0I will let you be the judge of that."
