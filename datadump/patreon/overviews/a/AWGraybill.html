I\u0027m a wife. I\u0027m a gamer. I\u0027m a writer. I\u2019ve been writing stories for most of my life and though I\u0027ve shared my work with a handful of people over the years, I\u2019ve been working on publication and other outlets only recently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e104/AWGraybill/WhyPatreon_zpslodczygx.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a mom to four small children (soon to be five), you probably already understand why I started this Patreon. We are a single income family (for now) and regular finances go to bills and our children first. In short, Patreon will initially help the financial burden of starting out in the self-publishing world. And as time goes on, when I have more books on the market, being paid for my work is not guaranteed to be consistent. So your patronage will continue to help me in the years to come.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe longer version\u2026\u003cbr\u003eI am just starting out, professionally, in this line of work. I would love to make it a long-term career. There are costs related to self-publishing that my husband and I struggle to meet. While I can sit at home and write dozens of stories, it\u2019s difficult for me to give them the proper attention they need to be published. I\u2019ve considered getting a side job. But the time it would take away from writing, plus the childcare expenses, wouldn\u2019t really help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon will help ensure the people I work with get paid and my family will be financially stable month to month. Especially as we reach the higher goals. Patreon will also give me the opportunity to continue in this career, publish more stories, work with artists on marketing ventures, and much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSide note: Dryad\u2019s Touch, the first book in the Void Waker series, was released October 2017. You can learn more about this, and see more artwork for my series, on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://awgraybill.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003eThe next venture, other than Elder Gods, is book 2 which I hope to have released this year. 2018\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://imgur.com/a/egtvv7A\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe gods of Arlania play dangerous games of power with one another, using the mortals as their pawns. Their newest target are two Sun Elf cousins, Berhalis and Daylor.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I plan to produce short stories and novels, the main focus of this page is a prologue to the Void Waker series. Each chapter of Elder Gods Overture will periodically be posted here first. Then, after 3 days, it will\u00a0 be posted on my website, Goodreads, and Deviantart. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also plan to continue the audio series on Youtube, but that will be less frequent. I will be able to upload chapters, both audio and written, faster with each goal we reach.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will receive early access to these chapters (in both forms) as they become available. Also, patrons who pledge certain amounts will be given access to the art, downloadable copies of each chapter, deleted scenes, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDisclaimer: The finished product is subject to change. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i38.photobucket.com/albums/e104/AWGraybill/TeamGraybillBannerDuck_zpsvmcx0hil.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to use this space to mention the people I work with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSarah Collingwood is my amazing editor.

I remember writing stories about characters I read about in books and seen in movies and tv. My stories also stemmed from my love of mythology, mostly Greek/Roman and Norse. This was something my grandmother greatly encouraged by buying me any book I thought I could read, despite having very little money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter my grandma passed away in 2006, I left Kansas to travel across the continental U.S. Shortly after this I met my husband through online gaming. He was the next to encourage me in my writing venture. And, while pregnant with my first born, I set to writing full fledged-books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward seven years, four children, and three books later, here we are.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e",
