    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHey fellow food lovers of the world, let me welcome you to my Patreon page where you and I can get up close and personal. I\u0027m Alla, creator of Allasyummyfood. I was born in small town in Latvia and came to England alone when I was 14 without speaking english. I tried many jobs, but my true passion was food. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI need your help to make what I\u2019ve already been doing even bigger and better than before. Over the past 3 years I\u0027ve been putting everything I have into making this channel grow and evolve by upgrading equipment, taking online classes and taking my food creations to the next level. With your help I can eventually take YouTube full time, which means more content will go up, more perks will become available to you and my dream of owning and operating a bakery store.  Now this is part of my life. I like making high quality videos but it takes time. I spend on average 25-30 hours each week, filming, editing and uploading new episodes. My channel is taking me more and more time. That\u2019s why I decided to set up this Patreon page. With your support I will be able to upload more often and create longer and higher quality videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I do with your money\u003c/strong\u003e?: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ll invest into a better lighting and audio recording equipment and better kitchen equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to produce better content and maybe get someone else on my team to help me with filming and production.\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to make a second channel for russian speaking friends and make great content as well, so they can understand it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would you support me on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe concept behind Patreon is the idea is that people can support an \u003cem\u003eongoing \u003c/em\u003eproject and help it improve. It is a platform that emphasizes the bond of trust that exists between content creators and their audience. As far as payment, your pledge amount will be automatically charged each month, but you can cancel or adjust at any time. I do hope you all come on board with me so we can have fun and make some awesome food together. I really appreciate all your support, I couldn\u0027t do it without you guys.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether you can or wish to contribute, my channel is free. The absolute best thing you can do for me is just keep watching my videos and cooking my recipes yourself (plus maybe sharing my videos).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn return we will do monthly hang outs on youtube or Skype with all of my patreons, where we can chat, see each other, discuss new recipes and videos and possibly meet up in future. Thank you so much! I will also do shout outs in my videos! I love you all!! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your warm comments and all the fun we share, it helps me a lot and keeps me going.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003exxx\u003cbr\u003e"
