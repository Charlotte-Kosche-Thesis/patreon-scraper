    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Andre LaFosse. My Patreon account is designed to fund the creation of tutorials on various techniques related to live looping music. In particular, I want to focus on functions and possibilities that are not widely understood or readily available in modern looping devices... but which are extremely powerful, and can be used in all different kinds of music. If you want to see what these videos are like,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRjhe9qWtn00cegswVPoUGSU-tQa07DQH\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u0027s a playlist of what I\u0027ve created so far\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy background with teaching looping goes back to 2002, when I launched the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://altruistmusic.com/edp/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEchoplex Analysis Pages\u003c/a\u003e, a series of annotated audio examples detailing aspects of the Echoplex Digital Pro (or \"EDP\") looping device. One of the first dedicated\u00a0\u003ca class=\"redactor_btn redactor_btn_italic\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003ehardware loopers released in the mid-\u002790s, the EDP has always held a unique spot in the live looping world. It\u0027s extremely flexible and deep, but involves a learning curve and a paradigm set that can be intimidating or overwhelming, for both newcomers and experienced users alike.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work with the EDP has been covered by numerous media outlets, including\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/1139/looping/14671\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGuitar Player Magazine\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.wnyc.org/story/64324-turntablist-guitarist/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWNYC Radio\u0027s New Sounds series\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s been the subject of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://bibliotecadelaguitarra.com/uploads/files/Textos%20Bilioteca/Expansion%20of%20electronic%20guitar%20performance%20practice%20through%20the%20application%20and%20development.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eacademic research\u003c/a\u003e, it\u0027s found its way into\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2127399/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea few Hollywood film scores\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0and has been cited by Jeff Larson, the developer of the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.circularlabs.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMobius software looper,\u003c/a\u003e as the original inspiration for his creating that program.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the twenty-odd years that have passed since the first appearance of dedicated hardware looping devices, two different trends have emerged in the looping world. On the one hand, the concept of looping has infiltrated the public consciousness to the extent that it\u0027s become commonplace; you can walk into a mainstream music store and expect to find at least one or two stompbox looping devices readily available, and Ed Sheerhan plays to arena-sized audiences doing a solo looping set.*\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as the popularity of looping has spread, its scope of possibility has narrowed. Many of the functions that would have been considered basic entry-level requirements for a looper several years ago are now thought of as esoteric fringe requests. (\u003ca href=\"https://www.thegearpage.net/board/index.php?threads/looping-for-guitarists-an-open-letter-to-fx-manufacturers.1539563/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDavid Torn\u0027s \"Open Letter to Looping Manufacturers\"\u003c/a\u003e is as effective and compelling of an assessment of this state of affairs as you\u0027ll find.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a big goal for this Patreon campaign is to foster a better understanding of some of the possibilities of live looping beyond the basic \"record + overdub\" template. The EDP will be the primary focus, since it\u0027s the looping device I know the best, and some of what I discuss will be specific to it. But I also want to demonstrate some of its capabilities in a more generalized sense. It\u0027s my hope that looping musicians can get a better understanding of how they might use these functions - and that manufacturers will be more inclined to include those features in their products. I also want to spend time examining other looping possibilities, including those more readily available in software like Ableton Live, Echoloop, and Mobius.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a professional music educator for the last 13 years, a huge part my livelihood revolves around teaching music. Quite simply, the more income I can generate from teaching looping, the more time and energy I can invest into it, and the more tutorials I can produce. Live looping techniques may seem like a very niche market, but I absolutely believe there\u0027s value in studying and disseminating this stuff. If you agree, please consider contributing to this Patreon campaign, at whatever level makes sense for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDeep thanks for reading, for listening, and for your interest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*My understanding is that Ed himself has been using Mobius on his 2017 tour. Ed: \"Shape of You\" is a total jam; buy me a drink sometime.\u003c/em\u003e"
