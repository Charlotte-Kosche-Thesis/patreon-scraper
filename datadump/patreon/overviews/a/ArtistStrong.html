I\u2019m here to help unleash your inner artist: our world is a better place because of your creativity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I was 18 and again when I was in my mid twenties I had some pretty scary health stuff happen. In fact, each time, I was told I could die. Hearing words like that change the way you see the world. And it has impacted every future decision I have made.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of those decisions is to fully embrace my creative interests. When people read or talk about the regrets of the dying, it\u2019s never to work more\u2026 it\u2019s to travel, to write the novel they always wanted to\u2026 and a myriad of other \u201cdoing\u201d activities. Yet, I have friends who have told me they daydream about walking into oncoming traffic on the way home from their jobs because they are THAT stressed. Our lives are just plain short. We don\u2019t know when our time is up: it\u2019s time to do something about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to reach as many people as I possibly can with my mission. People shouldn\u2019t wait until bad things happen in their lives to make changes to do the things they love. And I want to stand on soap boxes, send newsletters, host workshops, you name it, to help people access and develop their creative dreams. This is why I\u0027ve created\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.artiststrong.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArtist Strong.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOU can help. Support my work.
