Since 2003, it has been preserving objects, games, consoles,\nmicrocomputers, arcade cabinets and accessories testifying to the history of\npopular culture in the digital era.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIts collections, which rank among the most\nexhaustive ones in the world, are presented to the public through about thirty\nexhibitions of various sizes each year. They systematically showcase playable\nor usable historical machines. MO5.COM\u2019s collections have been organized to\nthis end: on the one hand, a \u201cheritage\u201d collection of items in perfect\ncondition is preserved, untouched, in view of a projected museum; on the other\nhand, an \u201cexhibition\u201d collection including duplicates of items already\npreserved is put to use to allow the public to play on historical equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAn important collection of several thousand\nsoftware and games complements our hardware holdings. MO5.COM also owns a\nspecialized library that includes full-runs of all the French-speaking press\ntitles, a selection of foreign titles as well as various books relating to the\ndigital culture and videogames.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePreservation\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eMO5.COM has particular expertise regarding the\npreservation of this heritage. Its members are able to repair and maintain the\nhardware items, in compliance with professional museum standards which can\nguarantee very long-term conservation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis professional dimension allowed the\norganization to establish a privileged relationship with public institutions,\nwhether they want to organize an exhibition on the history of video games, or\nto restore a computer from their own collection, or need to access old data\nmedia. MO5.COM can also provide methodological advice on the specific problems\nrelated to the preservation of electronic equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mo5.com/presse/collections.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePicture: Overview of\nour collections as of the second quarter of 2015\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eExhibitions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eTotaling more than 350 exhibitions since it was\nfounded in 2003, MO5.COM is the most active nonprofit organization in Europe\nshowcasing our digital heritage to the general public. Its exhibitions range\nfrom small events in multimedia libraries to vast booths in major shows\ndedicated to popular culture, to large-scale exhibitions in national museums.\nThe topics covered go from the history of video games through selected key\ntitles up to more specialized subjects in response to specific requests.\nAccordingly, MO5.COM designed exhibitions about the history of the SEGA brand,\nthe history of football games, the fantasy theme in video games, and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mo5.com/presse/game_story.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003ePicture: \u003c/em\u003eGame Story\u003cem\u003e exhibition at the Grand Palais in Paris, 2010-2011\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMO5.COM actively participates in two major\nprojects for the re-digitization of old digital works and their preservation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe first project involves setting up a\ndatabase and an international portal that will provide information about any\nvideogame-type of work, and will let you know instantly where it comes from,\nwho owns it and other contextual details important to historians.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe second project is more closely related to\nthe digitization of historical videogames as such, and takes the form of a\nspecific methodology and a set of accessible tools, which are already\nimplemented in Japan and France today. The goal is to re-read old original media\nin order to extract their raw contents, so that it can be preserved on central\nservers and possibly rewritten to new media or used on emulators.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://mo5.com/presse/scandisk.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003ePicture: Digitizing of\na Commodore 64 game disk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy are we on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eMO5.COM has been in existence for over 14 years\nnow and operates without any public subsidy. It is financed through its\nmembers\u2019 subscriptions and a financial contribution from the partners who host\nour exhibitions. The amount we ask is often quite modest, because we want to\navoid at all costs to make the hosting of an MO5.COM exhibition expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMO5.COM must however invest to further improve\nthe preservation of its collections and to finance its premises. Professional\npreservation equipment costs a lot. It includes neutral cardboard boxes, air\nfiltration systems, textile storage furniture, absolute filtration vacuum\ncleaners and special storage props for POS material and other large size items.\nPurchasing all this equipment allows us to better preserve our heritage and to\nget as close as possible to the preservation standards set by the French \u00ab\nmuseum law \u00bb.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is an essential step in our journey\ntowards the opening of a great museum of digital cultures. To achieve this\nwithout financially penalizing our other activities, we need to secure more\nresources, on a more regular basis, so that we can purchase as needed the\nnecessary tools for a good preservation of our collections.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHelp us preserve our digital heritage, help us\npreserve our culture !\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e"
