    "summary": "Hello my name is Brian Walker the songwriter and brainchild behind A Day Without Love. I have worked on A Day Without Love for the past 4 years in a touring and recording capacity and I need your help to help me move to the next level. Below is some information about why I think Patreon was the best decision. I have hesitated, meditated, prayed and asked whether this was good or not. In some ways, I thought I was denying letting things happen, in other ways I thought maybe just being gainfully employed would help me accomplish all of these goals. After some deep thought, I think asking for help while wanting to accomplish my creative journey as A Day Without Love is necessary. Please read my story and what I want to do with my Patreon campaign.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eAbout A Day Without Love\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWorking Collaboratively and Telling a Story\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI came up with the name A Day Without Love in 2008 when I was writing a poetry anthology book. I saw a couple fighting which then evolved to an incident of spousal abuse. I stopped the incident and then started to write a poem entitled A Day Without Love. It didn\u0027t take until 2013 where I decided to make a mission to myself to write about the struggles and beauty of being alive. It is my mission to share stories about my own life, experiences, and thoughts through music to connect with others. But I have a series of goals that I want to accomplish which is where I think you come in.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first full-length Solace released by Sounds and Tones Records was a concept record about coming to grips with mental illness, after touring on this record in the Midwest, South, Northeast and Mid Atlantic I have come to make many friends and also enjoy the experience of travel and food while telling a story. I have the following long and short-term goals to accomplish that will require the support of you to help me tell the story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Release my second concept record Diary\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Develop a video series via Youtube and other Video channels for Tour Vlogging, Food\u00a0 \u00a0Diaries and eventually a tour documentary.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Increase the amount of merchandise I provide to listeners and fans.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Help me press more physical copies of my records.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Help me with travel expenses to and from tour via bus ( until I am able to get a car).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Maintain my website and ability to record and release music via Adobe Creative Cloud.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI understand I have many goals with A Day Without Love and I think your help is needed to help me get to the next phase of allowing this to succeed starting with helping me release my concept record Diary in 2018 and helping me develop a budget to tour and have new merch. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTouring has been hard the past two years, I never owned a car or was able to afford a car at times I used my grandfather\u0027s car, but he is no longer with us on this earth and now I have to use Megabus and Boltbus to travel. Unfortunately not every DIY show is able to cover the expenses that come along with traveling via bus and often times I am in the negative regardless of my employment status. I have explored many avenues from grant writing, other crowdfunding websites and I think this is the best way to allow me to functionally achieve the goals with A Day Without Love.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be providing daily updates on my website ( \u003ca href=\"http://www.adaywithoutlove.com)\"\u003ewww.adaywithoutlove.com)\u003c/a\u003e and this Patreon site to help me with these goals. Once these goals are accomplished I will have three more A Day Without Love LPs to write and then I will be done ADWL as we know it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for the support you have given me thus far and the friends I have made and the people who have reached out to me.

I wrote the record about racism, politics, socioeconomic inequality, love, and friendships from my own perspective over the past 29 years of my life. I wanted to put all of my feelings out on the table while being unconventional. If you do donate over 10 dollars or more you will get an early release of the record and if you donate over 20 you will get access to B sides.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYes of course!

Unfortunately I was robbed in Baltimore and no longer have a video camera and can not afford a new one plus insurance and I will need your help to get a new camera and create new content. In addition I want to create a Food Review series where I discuss my experiences with various foods I eat while traveling America think of it like Anthony Bourdain but as a punk musician. Finally my final goal is to create a full US Tour Documentary about my experiences with music, food and people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much \u003c/strong\u003eis\u003cstrong\u003e Adobe Creative Cloud and your website?

While having a PC canceling Adobe Creative Cloud would hinder my ability to record my music or send demos to producers for future albums. I do not think it is safe to use cracked software ( I have had some bad experiences with losing books and songs with cracked software) so paying for my software is the only choice I have. Using Squarespace has been great for hosting my content and I definitely think using a cheaper option would hold back my way of communicating and sharing content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWill you continue to use this Patreon if you get a backing band or start making a lot of rockstar money\u003c/strong\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf I have a backup band I will still use this Patreon because having a band does not always mean funding is guaranteed, however, if we were to be able to fund everything with our music, merch, and shows alone I would stop this campaign.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if I want to support more than the highest tier?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can donate any amount that you want!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"\"\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNope!
