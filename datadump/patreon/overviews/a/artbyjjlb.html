I also post commissions I receive here, as well as WIPs and sketchbook pages, to give patrons a closer look into my artistic process. The art you find here is 100% traditional (handdrawn) with a few things edited and cross-processed in GIMP software. I would like to mention again that my art is both \u003cstrong\u003eNSFW \u003c/strong\u003eand\u003cstrong\u003e SFW\u003c/strong\u003e, so if that\u0027s not your thing, my work may not be for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"Do you take commissions?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a matter of fact, I do! There are literally hundreds of ways for you to get into contact with me for commission requests, but the best ones in my opinion, are directly via email ( jeremyjaymeslabelle@gmail.com ), or through messages on Tumblr ( artbyjjlb.tumblr.com ), or through notes on Deviantart ( jeremyjaymeslabelle.deviantart.com ). Commission prices are posted on Deviantart, and I will continue reposting commission prices here on Patreon to keep new patrons updated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eCommission examples:\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ort2-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/s2048x2048/23113222_10210777497495298_1853435334_o.jpg?oh=ae38d10fba3507361cc05df25af61663\u0026amp;oe=59FA203D\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\"How much do I have to pay to become a Patron?\"\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1.

Things like Sketchbook Posts, Video Content, about 75% of WIPs, and 90% of old artwork and nostalgia art are entirely exclusive to Patreon. Not to mention Patrons get to see all of my professional work and portfolio pieces WAY before other people do. Patrons are also the first to receive Pre-Order notifications for the new products I sell, as well as exclusive discounts just for being a Patron!

I also love traveling, so you can often catch me moving about the country or even internationally from my instagram (jeremyjaymeslabelle). I have wanderlust and I have no way to control it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to pay the bills while my artistic career takes off, I am also a theatre and performance actor in the greater Wisconsin area, a cunning linguist who has mastered Russian and French as well as English, and I take odds and ends jobs wherever I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current aspiration is to become licensed in tattooing, so I can bring even more art to life, and in a very permanent fashion! Although finding an apprenticeship is rough, I am still looking when I have the time... Wish me luck!",
