I\u0027ve spent 7 years in prison for non violent drug offenses, and have been a free man for a little over a year now. While incarcerated, I realized my life needed some major changes and everyday I worked as hard as I possibly could to make those changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Art was a major part of those changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I realized that through art, I could focus on more positive things. Now since my release, I\u0027ve accomplished many more positive things. I created a YouTube channel called AfterPrisonShow about a month after my release where I\u0027ve \u00a0chronicled what it\u0027s been like adjusting back into society after 7 years in prison. How I found a job ( which is brutal killer work.) \u00a0And how important it is to never give up on trying to better yourself no matter what your situation is. Or what obstacles, hardships, or roadblocks stand in your path.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfterPrisonShow also offers tutorial videos for those who may not know just how prisoners do certain things, like tattooing, and also preparing meals with minimal and snack machine like items.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut there is a much bigger picture I have in mind for AfterPrisonShow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to really help and teach people, as well. For those who are struggling. Whether it be with addiction or job searches. Young people who are on the road to troubling futures. I want to create content that really reaches those people and also helps them as I am someone who has lived through all of those things personally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYouTube is full of meaningless, and mindless content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want AfterPrisonShow to stand away from that, and to be something inspiring, educational, and at the same time, entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s because of all this that I have decided to create a Patreon account. I believe there are many who take the time to watch my videos who want to see AfterPrisonShow really succeed on a much bigger level. If you\u0027re one of these people, then I thank you in advance for considering a monthly subscription fee of any amount you deem worthy. And in exchange, I will be offering different rewards packages based on your level of support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to check out this page. And also, thank you for believing in AfterPrisonShow!"
