Through this language I have learned to understand myself and the world around me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy understanding and compassion for the very real human lives we live has expanded over time as the mystery behind the symbols of astrology has continued to revel itself. \u003cbr\u003eMy passion is to bring this body of knowledge to others in a way that is of practical use in helping them to manage the real world challenges of their lives. \u003cbr\u003e",
