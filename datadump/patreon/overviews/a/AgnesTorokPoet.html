    "summary": "I am a spoken word poet writing about politics and happiness and stuff that matters. I make online videos and poetry shows that are free to watch and to attend. But in order to make beautiful-looking videos every month, I am going to need some help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause art should be accessible to everyone\u003c/strong\u003e, not just those who can afford to pay for it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the other hand - artists need to get paid.\u00a0Artists, like anyone, need money to pay rent and eat food and make more art. That includes both me and the artists I will work with to make new videos - film makers, musicians, animators - who knows! (tell me what kinds of collaborations you would like to see!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArt should be free, but artists need to get paid?\u00a0Patreon is how we solve that equation.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging, you become a modern patron of the arts. If you pledge, you support my work directly - and get direct access to the new videos I produce. You will see new videos before they go out for free to everyone else. You will make possible new poetry videos about the kinds of things you care about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge a monthly sum to my work (starting at\u00a0$1), you make it possible for me to do what I love, making art about things we both care about, while paying everyone involved in production. If even one person pledges even $1 per month, I will make one new poetry video every month. \u003cstrong\u003eI will make what I create available to everyone for free - but those who pledge get to see it first.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy clicking the buttons to the right, you can choose a pledge. If you pledge more than\u00a0$1, you will start to access special rewards. These include a personal poem on a topic of your choice, online hang out time - and a say in what you want me to make more poems about in the future.\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0I want to hear from you and would love your feedback!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does it cost?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou choose the pledge you want to make and the pledges start at\u00a0$1 per month. You can cancel your pledge at any time, and Patreon can never charge you more than your monthly pledge - even if I would feel super inspired and make 20 new videos in a month (who knows!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf enough people pledge, we will reach a goal together\u003c/strong\u003e. That will allow me to make more exciting videos, collaborate with other forms of artists, do more shows and tours - and perform near you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom here on, anything is possible - let\u0027s go on this adventure together!\u003c/strong\u003e"

I make as much of my work as possible available for free online - and this is what makes it possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a year now, I have been producing one new spoken word poetry video every month. My Patrons (Patreon supporters) get a say in what it should be about. They get to see it first, and to take full credit for making it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a community here and all my Patrons are part of it. Together, we have monthly writing workshops. I give the instructions and those who want to follow them. I also write personal poems for all my higher-tier Patreons on any topic of their choosing. This is a back-and-forth, a two-way-communication, and you are so welcome to be part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything I make is political, in one way or another. And everything is about community, in more ways that one. That\u0027s where people like you come in. That\u0027s where creating together comes in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs often as I can afford to, I collaborate with other artists (film makers, musicians, illustrators, animators) to make brand new forms of art - and you get to see it first.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love what I do, and who I get to do it with.
