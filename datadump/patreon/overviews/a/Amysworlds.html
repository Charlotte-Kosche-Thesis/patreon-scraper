People who, perhaps want to savour it and\nread just the one chapter a week.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe money we raised in the kickstarted enabled me to get a professional intro\nvideo made, which I can\u2019t wait to see, from the lady\u2019s other work it should be\nreally good. I\u2019d love to use some of the funds we raise from Patreon to get an\nouttro video made too. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI was always going to do this project. If the kickstarter didn\u2019t fund, I was\nstill going to record it, if no-body listens, I will still record it. Sixty-two\nchapters, Sixty-two weeks, who wants to help me?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m setting the Patreon to charge monthly, so for the minimum amount of $1 you\u2019d\nbe getting 4, possibly 5 videos! I live in the UK and $1 would just about buy\nme a chocolate bar as it\u2019s about 70p\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe project launches Sunday the 3rd of January, time yet to be decided,\nand I\u2019ll be around to respond to comments etc. For an hour or so after the\nlaunch. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nCheck out the rewards and let me know what you think!\u003cbr\u003e\nAmy\n"
