Eight years ago I started a music, storytelling and polaroid platform titled\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u0027A POLAROID STORY\u0027\u003c/strong\u003e where I capture my favorite artist (mostly in the soul, jazz, hiphop, rap, rnb, funk, blues, trap realm) on Polaroid while going through the artist\u0027s musical repertoire. I\u0027ve been doing this concept for 8 years now and until today, I\u0027ve managed to capture and interview artists like:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKENDRICK LAMAR, T.I.,TORY LANEZ, JOEY BADA$$, MOBB DEEP, WIZ KHALIFA, Q-TIP, QUESTLOVE, ANDERSON PAAK, TINASHE,  ASAP ROCKY, BLACK THOUGHT, DIPLO, SCHOOLBOY Q, MARK RONSON, RAE SREMMURD, CIARA, MIGUEL, ERYKAH BADU, J COLE, PHARRELL WILLIAMS, PUSHA T, VIC MENSA, DEVONTE HYNES, MULATE ASTATKE, GILL SCOTT-HERON, JAY ELECTRONICA,\u00a0 GURU,SNOOP DOGG,  KELIS, GRAND MASTER FLASH, BILAL, SUGAR HILL GANG, CYPRESS HILL, A-TRAK, NENEH CHERRY, ZAP MAMA, ASAP FERG, JMSN, FREDDIE GIBBS, THEOPHILUS LONDON and many many more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/977046f5b7527f39b8353000d0b65691/tumblr_inline_oya0akH6VK1r21jmd_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere I started APolaroidStory.Com with a simple Polaroid and written context, my interest and love for making video interview/conversational content made me switch over to video after 4 years of executing APS. I had the incredible blessing to do my very first video interview with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/eDhE1LZXcgU\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKendrick Lamar.\u003c/a\u003e This motivated me to evolve and grow in that department so I started to work with volunteers who were looking to improve their videography and editing skills and help me produce more video content. I currently work with a run and gun team of 3 myself including and an additional (volunteer) documentary photographer when available/necessary. To be more independent when it comes to camera gear I reached out to Sony Belgium who provided me with an in-house video camera (my trusted Sony A7S) and two additional lenses, so I always have an in-house camera that volunteers can use and I\u0027m not relying on material from other parties to make my content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I learned that producing video content on an independent basis is very expensive. Until this day I spent my own budget in producing the content, which means providing concert tickets (I\u0027m not always granted free tickets) travel expenses for my team, hotel expenses for abroad features or multiple day festival features, food for my volunteers, edit fees for editors, you name it, I paid for it out of love for my content and what I do.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/a3e84f6547a549e830d2491827993023/tumblr_oya0h3VMSm1r5riguo1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, after 8 years its getting harder and harder to maintain the finance part myself so I\u0027m looking for supporters, contributors and/or music lovers who appreciate my project and want to push it with a financial contribution so we can speed up our content pace, buy sound material to optimise our sound quality (for now we still record with an iphone) and make us more agile to grab certain opportunities who are mostly abroad considering the nature of my content. Besides agility and gear, your contributions would also be used to improve the reach of our YouTube platform to increase views and subscribers. I\u0027m not against advertising per se, but I don\u0027t want to be too dependent on advertisers since you have to count ROI to balance out the budget injection -\u00a0 which is fine - but not something I want to be 100% dependent on. I only recently activated Adsense on the APS YouTube account mostly out of necessity, but the revenue out of YouTube advertising is marginal for now and will take a long time to be somewhat profitable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/d8d739bb4c090f7d0c45d61e9219b8c6/tumblr_oybkkn1VPB1r5riguo1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always combined my passion for APolaroidStory.com with a fulltime job in Pr and Communication but I recently made the jump to quitting my fulltime job to focus on APolaroidStory.Com and see where a fulltime investment can lead towards. For now this resulted in a faster tempo of getting the edited content online and an increase of our YouTube subscriptions by 400+ subscribers since July 2017 but in terms of agility we are still a bit stuck.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/8797a15f2b2d5394a4e642ff17b1efc1/tumblr_oya0zvFv3x1r5riguo1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how will your money come to use?\u00a0Every Dollar or Euro you invest into APolaroidStory.Com will be used in updating the material we work with, (batteries, tripods, rigs)\u00a0 travel expenses (cabs, trains, bus, airbnb/hotel, food for the team) graphic and edit fees to upgrade and produce the content quicker, the purchase of an in-house workspace with new desktops, bigger harddisks to archive the content, the production of more in-depth documentary features (for example when an artist asks APS to come and portray them for different days on tour) more abroad festival features (for example an APS coverage at SXSW), fees for additional documentary photography, the set-up of an APS exposition tour in different cities worldwide, the production of the first APS book that I would love to release in 2019, there are many goals, but for now, I\u0027m mainly focused on what is most important, facilitating my production process so I can deliver the best, fun, most entertaining and genuine content I can make.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/bba05da4ab2ddb1833b2f210e3bc2509/tumblr_oy9zzxVzc41r5riguo1_540.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and consideration.
