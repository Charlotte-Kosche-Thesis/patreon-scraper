    "summary": "Hi! My name\u0027s Amy Lee - you can call me AL - and I am delighted that you are here. I\u0027m guessing you like creative people, and that supporting the artistic process on some level excites you. I love that, because it lights me up, too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a little about me...I\u0027m an actor in theatre, film, and podcasts (SAG-AFTRA / AEA). I also write fiction, poetry, and have recently moved into screenplays. I dabble in photography, mixed media visual art, and the fine art of home cooking, mostly for my own amusement. Sometimes, I\u0027ve even been known to work as a producer. Did I mention I also work full-time at a day job?\u00a0It sounds like a lot, right? It\u0027s a lot. Even with strong hustle.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I need help with in order to take my acting and writing career to the next level: 1) time, 2) capital that makes that time possible, and 3) a profound sense of accountability to my audience. To that end, a good friend of mine recommended that I give the Patreon community a try. That\u0027s why I\u0027m here. I need creative patrons. I need y\u0027all. (I grew up in far west Texas, so words like \u003cem\u003ey\u0027all\u003c/em\u003e will occasionally be employed. Want to learn more about me? Come check out \u003ca href=\"http://www.amyleepearsall.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here\u0027s what I\u0027d like to propose: I make stuff. I let you in on the process (and the progress). I get things done because you\u0027ve chosen to believe in me enough to contribute, and that holds me accountable. Maybe we even bounce ideas off one another. I take some projects from pipe dream to full fruition, thanks to you. Together, we take things up a notch and we have fun. Because if we\u0027re not having fun...man, why are we even doing it? So let\u0027s play. =)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMuch love and many thanks -\u003cbr\u003eAL\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
