Frisk is using her personal control of the \ntimeline to ensure monsters have a peaceful return to the surface world \u2013\n but the seven who sealed them underground in the first place have some \nproblems with this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Inspired by Stephen Chow, Don Bluth, Doc Hammer, HP Lovecraft, and of course, the world of Toby Fox, \u003cem\u003eThe Anomaly\u003c/em\u003e\n aims to tell a slow-burn episodic story true to the spirit and lore of \nthe original game, but with perhaps a bit more gravity now that Frisk is\n an adult. Sometimes it will be cheeky, sometimes happy, sometimes sad, \nbut hopefully always entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Anomaly\u003c/em\u003e \nconsists of full color pages and the occasional playable RPG interlude. I\n will continue to update the comic once a week minimum until either the \nstory is concluded, or until Toby releases his own official comics and \nproves all of my headcanons horribly, horribly wrong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began drawing \u003cem\u003eThe Anomaly\u003c/em\u003e in 2016 as a way of coping with a difficult time in my life, but now it has grown into something much bigger. Working\non this has helped me grow as well, as both an artist and a person. I am as\ndetermined to continue that as I am to create a little positive corner of the\ninternet where \u003cem\u003eUndertale\u2019s\u003c/em\u003e philosophy\ncan thrive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I need your help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI won\u0027t give you specifics or go into a sob story -- we all have struggles, we all have problems, and I won\u0027t presume mine are any greater or less than anyone else\u0027s. I will say, however, that like many people, I have a whackton of debt. Those loans are due, but I have to pay my existing bills as well. If my budget gets any tighter, it could seriously hinder regular updates, if not kill the comic entirely, as I\u0027ll need to commit to work full-time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you really enjoy this comic, please consider supporting me. Even a few extra dollars a month will go a long way toward keeping me and my cat fed. The more support I get here, the more likely I\u0027ll be able to keep up with regular (and better!) updates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat you get for supporting The Anomaly\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy entire process will be posted here: the rough sketches, the line art, my thoughts on the design process, laughably bad scrapped pages, and possibly even some spoilerrific concept art. As a patron, you will see everything before everyone else does, and will get updates in real time. In some cases, you\u0027ll even get access to canon content that regular readers will never see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut \u003cem\u003eThe Anomaly\u003c/em\u003e is set in the real world, and that world needs to be populated! Higher tier donors win cameos in the comic, game, or both. You could wind up as a patron at Grillby\u0027s, a barista at Muffet\u0027s, Mettaton\u0027s backup dancer, or even one of Asgore\u0027s advisors -- the possibilities are endless, and it will always be a surprise! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTop tier donors can even make personal art requests of me once a month -- just about any subject matter goes! Let me draw for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnything helps however, and as always, you have my sincerest thanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay determined, friends!\u003cbr\u003e--coffeelemental\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hello! I am a California ex-pat now\nliving in the Land of Snow and Health Care. My life consists of cartoons, video\ngames, debt, and a lot of caffeine and alcohol, primarily because I never quite\ngot the whole \u201cadulting\u201d thing down.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI got into \u003cem\u003eUndertale\u003c/em\u003e at the behest of my brother, who wouldn\u2019t shut up about\nit (what else are younger siblings for?). At the time I was going through a\nreally rough patch in my life, and lo and behold \u2013 not only did I love the\ngame, but it also helped me overcome a lot of the darkness that I\u2019d been\nwrestling with for almost a decade. It\u2019s probably super lame to say it changed\nmy life, but it did, and there\u2019s now some part of me that hopes to spread that\npositivity and keep it going, even if it\u2019s only to one other person.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEnter this comic, I suppose. I\nbegan drawing \u003cem\u003eThe Ambassador\u003c/em\u003e five\nmonths ago as a way of coping with said existential despair. It was originally\nonly intended to be for me, as a way to practice my art and teach myself\ndigital illustration using characters I loved, but instead it took on a life of\nits own. I decided to share it and tell a story instead, which is something\nI\u2019ve never done before. To this end, the style and quality wildly varies in the\nfirst chapter as I experiment with various techniques, or as I went back to\nedit certain pages; if you want to see what two years of art school education\nversus five months of dedicated solo practice looks like, look no further than\nchapter one and follow its evolution. (Don\u0027t do art school, kids).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my dream to make it as a freelance artist, illustrator, and storyteller, even if it means instant noodles for the rest of my life. But with your help, maybe I can throw a hotdog in there as well. May as well die young but happy, right?\u003cbr\u003e",
