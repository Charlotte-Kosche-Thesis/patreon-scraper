    "summary": "After a great deal of thoughtful prompting by our faithful listeners, the \u003cstrong\u003eAfronerd Radio\u003c/strong\u003e machine has joined Patreon!  It is imperative that if our vision of a multi-layered and expanded Blerd/Nerds of color media are to flourish in cyberspace, we need committed fan funded support. Recent \"blerd\" successes like \u003cem\u003eThe Black Panther, Lionforge Comics\u003c/em\u003e, the return of \u003cem\u003eMilestone Media\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eGet Out\u003c/em\u003e, the \u003cem\u003eAfropunk\u003c/em\u003e festival and a myriad of independent graphic novels deem it necessary that social media outlets like \u003cstrong\u003eAfronerd Radio \u003c/strong\u003ehelp in bolstering the visibility of these properties.  With your assistance, we can continue highlighting urban alternative projects that are routinely ignored or minimized in mainstream media.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Cost of Podcasting\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, podcasting is an expensive endeavor.  \u003cstrong\u003eAfronerd Radio\u003c/strong\u003e currently airs on \u003cem\u003eBlogTalkRadio\u003c/em\u003e and it costs approx. 2K plus a year based on the tier level that allows us greater audience access and technical capabilities.  We are considering broadcasting alternatives that might be superior and more user friendly than \u003cem\u003eBlogTalk\u003c/em\u003e but that would encompass upgrading equipment and audio recording devices.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdding a Video Component \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNever let it be said that we don\u0027t love what we do at \u003cstrong\u003eAfronerd\u003c/strong\u003e!  Podcasting is an extremely rewarding and enlightening experience.  But if we are to become more impactful, we must strengthen our Youtube presence.   We are exploring podcast studio options that allow for video broadcasting and those fees can run up to $600 a month.  *At this juncture, there is a definite need to have an ethnic/minority themed channel that can be competitive with imprints such as \u003cem\u003eCollider, Screen Junkies\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eThe Nerdist\u003c/em\u003e while providing the audience with an often overlooked urb-alt perspective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb presence\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAfronerd\u003c/strong\u003e (beyond podcasting) is a burgeoning media collective.  We are currently updating our website, \u003cem\u003eAfronerd.com \u003c/em\u003ewhich encompasses site security, hosting and domain expenses.  We also require web developers to assist with web optimization and ancillary site maintenance issues that occur with running a website. These fees cost upwards of 1.2K to 2K annually.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWriters and staff stipends\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is our goal to get our enterprise monetized in a number of different ways.  With patron\u003cbr\u003esupport we can pay writers and staff who provide their time, research and writing skills to make \u003cem\u003eAfronerd.com\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eAfronerdradio\u003c/em\u003e a premiere urban alternative media source.  We value our writers time and resources and believe that they should be compensated for their commitment to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNational/Global Events\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the concept of \"nerds of color\" encroaches deeper into popular culture, there are conventions and events that require our perspective and reporting.  The convention circuit is growing exponentially and we would love to garner up-to-date information and interviews from many of the familiar (and some lesser known) players in the industry.  Hopefully, with patron support we can take Afronerd Radio global (ok, let\u0027s start with San Diego Comic Con and ECBACC, first!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd lastly, the \u003cstrong\u003eAfronerd\u003c/strong\u003e Team (Claire Lanay, Capt. Kirk, Daryll B and Dburt) want to personally thank our stalwart supporters who are consistently encouraging us to improve and shoot for the stars.  With your contributions we will be fully capable and confident that we can meet our goals with having a distinct place in nerd culture.\u003cbr\u003e"
