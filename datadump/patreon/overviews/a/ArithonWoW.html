I have been helping in maintaining addons since 2005, started as translator, then picked up abandoned ones, and creating brand new ones. \u003cbr\u003eDifferent type of addons require different type of effort. For functional type of addons, new ideas will be popping up, new features require time to be developed, though three could be bugs waiting to be investigated and get resolved. For data or information type of addons, it will take lots of time collecting the data, validating them to make sure they are all correct, and then consolidate them to present to user.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing a developer and a maintainer of WoW addons, I spent more than half of my online time looking at codes, creating new lines (functions or data), drawing new maps, and validating them. Most of my guild members know it\u0027s usually hard to get my immediate response on guild channel as my eyes are usually not on the game screen. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s kind of interest and or sense of accomplishment which make me keep working on WoW addons. But still I need to live and face the real world. I did receive some donation from users, but that\u0027s not happening every month. Sometimes it may not come for more than an entire year. I am hoping by creating a Patreon page will draw some of the users\u0027 attention to support on a regular basis to help me and support me keep working on WoW addons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eMy Works\u003c/h2\u003eBelow is the list and summary of the addons I am working on:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/301\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAtlas\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/301\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/rzOumZR.png\"\u003eThis is a instance map browser with extension to display other sort of maps like battlegrounds, transportation and routes, class order halls, scenarios, etc. \u003cbr\u003eI picked up the maintainer role since 2011, and we used to have a small team working together. But it\u0027s now only me working on this one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/4344\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAccountant Classic\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis is the addon to help you track your monetary incoming and outgoings within WoW. It logs \nper-session and running totals of how much money you have spent and \nearned from vendors / loot / quests etc...\u003cbr\u003eI started as a translator but then the original author has left WoW, so I took it over in 2007 till now. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/100/524/Accountant_Classic.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/266238\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWorld Map Tracking Enhanced\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis was created in April 2017 right after I created 4 of HandyNotes plugins. The idea is it is quite a trouble to open the interface\u0027s option panel, expand the HandyNotes\u0027 node, and go to plugin page to toggle which plugin to be shown or hidden. So why not somehow hijacking the built-in\u0027s tracking function? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/203/62/worldmaptrackingenhanced.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/265722\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHandyNotes - Broken Shore\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis was created in April 2017 just right after the Legionfall force arrived the Broken Shore. I started to add the rare mobs\u0027 location for the first version, with the plan to add the treasure nodes in my mind. But soon the players suggest to add treasure nodes, and I implemented it shortly. It seems now this one become a bit popular as it helps a lot while farming those treasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/202/787/brokenshore_cache.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/265563\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHandyNotes - Legion Instance World Quest\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis was created in April 2017 which support to show the world quest elite mobs\u0027 location, plus specific quest item or NPC\u0027s location.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/202/313/return-to-karazhan.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/265563\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHandyNotes - Class Order Halls\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis was created in April 2017. Atlas has a plugin for Class Order Halls while Legion expansion launched. It just came to my mind why not creating a similar feature but directly on WorldMap window.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/202/315/mage-hall.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/265782\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHandyNotes - Suramar and Shal\u0027Aran Telemancy\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis was created in April 2017 with some enhanced features to show the telemancy between Shal\u0027Aran and nodes in Suramar, plus some POIs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://media-elerium.cursecdn.com/attachments/202/594/portal-location.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://mods.curse.com/project/102320\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCoordinates Tracking\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eThis was created in September 2016, a light and simple addon to show coordinate information on the screen or on WorldMap window.

It started to adoped the WoW\u0027s built-in token functions which you can set to track up to 3 currencies while you open your bags, but I make it to show on the screen.
