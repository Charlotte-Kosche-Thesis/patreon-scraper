I got my start in fandom art, but I do both original and fan based work, and my goal is a semi-realistic style combining real proportions with vivid color and scenery to give you something you might wake up one morning and see at your front door.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy pledge to me? You\u0027re helping give me the freedom to make more of that sweet art you like, and you\u0027re helping me keep the basics like my tablet and computer software up to date and ready to go as well as giving me resources to make prints and other awesome goodies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut! What do you get out of this? I\u0027m glad you asked. Want to see your favorite creatures become realistic monsters? You got it. Want that hot anime dude made real? Here you go. Want some original content straight out of crazy-brain-town? That\u0027s what I\u0027m in the business of doing on a day to day basis. But, you ask, what about rewards? For your invaluable help, I\u0027ll be giving you some awesome shiny things in return. Check my rewards section for things like tutorials, sketches, art streams, and more.\u003cbr\u003e"
