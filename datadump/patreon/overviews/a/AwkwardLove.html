    "summary": "Hello everyone! This is George Berger, artist and writer of Awkward Love. I\u0027ve been mad about comics my whole life, and two years ago I started making my own strip. What started off as a goofy little vehicle for sending jokes and gags to my friends eventually became a larger project with readers and... dare I say... fans! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeedless to say I have not been able to focus on Awkward Love full time, as a matter of fact I currently hold a full time job, two major freelance clients and I teach nights at a New Jersey university. Patreon could very well mean I can finally stop working so hard on other projects and THAT means I\u0027ll be able to turn my full attention to Awkward Love! I have some huge ideas in the works for this strip including a very big spinoff and none of it can happen without the help of my lovely readers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou will also be helping me put food a treats into the mouths of Max, Alvie, Wolfie and Taffy.... and Alyssa if she asks nice ;) I resisted this Patreon thing for a long time as I have always wanted this comic to be about fun and good vibes, not money, but reality has demanded that I give it a shot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will you be getting with your donation?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy that is a wonderful question! Obviously you\u0027ll be getting my very heart felt thanks, but what\u0027s more important is you will be getting MORE AWKWARD LOVE! That\u0027s right, for every side project I can finally put down I\u0027ll be adding another weekly strip to my schedule. More One-panel gags, more \"Beginnings\" entries into the saga of how I met my wife, and more \"Meanwhile at the Office\" bits focusing on my life as a game designer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you click the \u201c\u003cstrong\u003eBecome a \nPatron\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d button, you can select how much you want to pledge per month. \nYou\u0027ll be charged automatically, and can adjust or cancel your pledge at\n anytime. My webcomic will forever be free online, but I appreciate any support.\u003cbr\u003e"
