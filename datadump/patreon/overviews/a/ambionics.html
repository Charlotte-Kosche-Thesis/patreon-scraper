    "summary": "Hello Friends,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Ben. I am after your support to help me bring my 3d printed, body powered arm, to not only my son Sol, but to the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eDue to some bad luck during our indiegogo campaign I am in need regular short term funds to be able to continue my work. I am working on new prototypes \u00a0and developing the arm for my son Sol and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy son Sol was named after the solar eclipse on the day of his birth. Sadly, his arm had to be amputated ten days after he was born due to an injury at birth. It was awful and it changed me forever. I\u0027m a psychology teacher by profession and I noticed a gap between when a working prosthetic arm would be most useful and what was available at his age (then 9 months old).  I have worked on this project full time for a year on no income and no investment. I want to give kids like my son more options, earlier than ever before. Sol loves his arm and lots of parents want one for their children too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_620/v1489136577/vkcivcwp4sac9tgz0klt.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eFrom the news desk//\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eResearching infant development with prosthetics, Ben Ryan is developing\na unique prosthetic that is safe for small infants to wear, enabling a natural\nacceptance of prosthetic arms for young children. An unparalleled innovation\nwithin this sphere of the medical field, the design and production of the 3D\nprinted hydraulic prosthetic has enabled cost savings of up to 76%, as well as time\nsavings in design and production of 90% - substantial efficiencies compared to\ntraditional methods of manufacture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen Ben Ryan\u2019s son was\nborn in March 2015, complications resulted in the unavoidable amputation of his\nlower left arm. Although able to keep a few inches of his lower arm, Ben\u2019s son\nSol would have to wait three years for a myoelectric prosthetic from the NHS,\nand one year before a cosmetic prosthetic would be fitted. Ryan saw his son\nlosing responsiveness and acceptance of his left arm, and decided to act. Having\nundertaken extensive research into infant development and faced with the\nstatistic that approximately 50% of young children don\u2019t accept prosthetics\nonce provided by the NHS in the UK, Ryan first designed a foam arm for his son,\nand later a hydraulic prosthetic, enabling Sol to move his thumb on his own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRelying on the\nexpertise of the innovation team at Bangor University and Autodesk design\nsoftware, Ryan designed and created his hydraulic prosthetic arm on the\nStratasys Connex3 3D printer. First practicing with prototypes of his design,\nRyan developed 3D printable flexible actuators and a power splitting unit\n(double acting helical bellow - DAHB) for the prosthetic. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cThe success of my\npatented DAHB mechanism draws on the advanced capabilities of the Stratasys\nConnex3 Printer\u2013 the ability to combine rigid and soft materials within the\nsame printing job is vital to the success of the design,\u201d explains Ryan \u201cThe\nimmense efficiencies seen by the hydraulic Ambionics arm with regards to time\nsavings and cost reduction compared to other methods is testament to this.\u201d \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs well as its light 3D\nprinted design that weighs less than traditional myoelectric alternatives, the\nhydraulic prosthetic is body powered and enables infants to grow accustomed to\ntheir \u201carm\u201d from their early years. The ability to operate without any\nelectronic devices or batteries, is unique to the Ambionics design and ensures  that infants as young as 8-10 months can safely\nwear the prosthetic without any increased risk of injury.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eScan of the arm to wearable prosthetic in just five days\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhile the NHS takes 11\nweeks to convert the scan of the arm into a wearable prosthetic, Ben Ryan is\nable to produce the prosthetic in only five days. With the flexibility to keep\nthe scan on file, the digital copy allows replacement prosthetics to be easily\nproduced through 3D printing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cEssentially the entire\nprosthetic is 3D printed,\u201d Ryan adds. \u201cOnly the strong Tango Black Plus\nmaterial and the dissolvable SUP706 support material make the complex interior\ncompressed air power assist, the hydraulic power assist as well as the manual\noperation through body power possible.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHaving patented its DAHB\ntechnology inside the prosthetic, Ambionics is aiming to sell the service to\nhealthcare providers worldwide. Continuing its research and testing into infant\ndevelopment with prosthetics, the company is starting a crowdfunding project on\nMarch 1\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;st\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; to enable clinical trials and help the business expand further.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u201cBen Ryan\u2019s approach to\nproblem solving with 3D printing as a facilitator and the terrific results\nenjoyed by doing are indicative of what can be achieved when harnessing\nStratasys technology,\u201d says Scott Rader, General Manager, Healthcare Solutions,\nStratasys. This case demonstrates the faster delivery and thus acceptance of 3D\nprinted prosthetics against traditional versions, while clearly underscoring\nthe incredible cost-savings achievable from deploying the technology.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e"
