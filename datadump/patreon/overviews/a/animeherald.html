I\u0027ve been working as an anime writer for over fifteen years at this point, and I\u0027ve served as editor-in-chief of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.animeherald.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eAnime Herald\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e for more than seven of them. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnime Herald began as a bit of a dream, founded in 2010 as I was helping to turn the lights off at Anime Dream (RIP).

Being able to discuss and share our thoughts on the latest shows, and the industry at large is something of a dream for us.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut, since day one, this has been a volunteer operation. Every article, every review, and every column has been written 100% gratis, with nobody drawing a paycheque. All revenues have gone into paying for infrastructure - the server, backups, and what have you - and just about all shortfalls have been paid for out-of-pocket. I\u0027d like to be able to change that.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027d like to continue to offer them a free and independent platform for commentary and discussions. And, more important, I want to be able to pay our fabulous team, who contribute countless hours to the goal. We\u0027ve challenged publishers, and broken stories of corruption. We\u0027re not afraid to stand tall as we deliver the truth, and we\u0027ve proudly stood up to players in the industry when push comes to shove.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your funding, I\u0027ll continue to build Anime Herald ad-free, without any skins, banners, or brand deals. As our existing ad agreements expire, we will not approach renewals. We\u0027ll be able to continue to bring high-quality content without the burdens of sponsorship, and we\u0027ll be working, first and foremost, for you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nNerdy Talk Podcast\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNerdy Talk started as a bit of a lark, as the team sought a platform to just let loose and discuss the goings-on in the anime industry. While we\u0027ve had a few setbacks in the past, Nerdy Talk has firmly become a part of our overall identity. Featuring yours truly and with a crew of Herald team members, this (roughly) monthly session mixes the thoughtful with the quirky, as we discuss the comings and goings of the anime industry. There\u0027s no filter here, so you can see how we *really* feel about those niggling topics like Anime Strike\u0027s big entrance to the anime world.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nYouTube Content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027re still kind of forging new ground into this frontier.

Being able to discuss our differences is a fantastic thing, and it\u0027s something that I\u0027ve always enjoyed.
