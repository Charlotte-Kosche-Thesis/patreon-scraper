I mainly shoot roller derby and LARP, and get a real kick out of showing people themselves being Big Damn Heroes! \u00a0From scrims to British Champs games, small LARP player events to big arena battles where the future of nations is decided, I love derby, I love LARP, and I *really* love shooting them!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I\u0027m able to, I also love shooting live performance - burlesque, bands, circus... if someone\u0027s up on a stage (or doing walkabout) being awesome, I love to be there documenting the awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis stuff does take time though, and adds to wear and tear on my equipment. I still have to pay for insurance (including public liability, so if I somehow manage to injure you with my equipment, you get a payout too!) for this work, and I have to pay travel, food etc - so I\u0027m swallowing my pride and asking for a chip-in from you guys, the awesome people I point a camera at.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m aiming to produce at least a photo-set a month, publicly available, released under CC-BY-NC. I\u0027m hoping to be able to produce a lot more than that in practice! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t thought of perks for patrons yet, but that\u0027ll be coming soon, along with a nice header image and all that pretty stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be attempting to blog as I go, keeping people updated with what I\u0027m up to, where I\u0027ve been, and where I\u0027m going to be.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far, and if you decide to chip in, thank you so much for helping me keep documenting people doing amazing things!"
