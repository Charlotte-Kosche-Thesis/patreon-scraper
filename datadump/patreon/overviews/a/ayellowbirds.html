    "summary": "\"Cypora\u0027s Guide\" began as an inkling of a project for National Novel Writing Month: an #ownvoices story about an autistic Jewish trans girl\u2014whose story wasn\u0027t built on any of those aspects of her identity, while also still making sure it informed how things played out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe world of Qarqa is our setting, once home to a globe-spanning empire that utterly collapsed less than two decades ago, leaving behind it an extensive network of dungeons full of treasures and monsters. As \"adventuring\" rises to become a well-defined trade, so too do the problems with having a large class of self-appointed heroes become more apparent. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Cypora Schenk: one of the common folk, daughter of a tavern-keeper who happens to live at the crossroads between two well-known dungeons. As more and more adventurers pass through town, admiration turns to apathy, and ultimately, a decision to oppose those who set themselves up as do-gooders...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first story\u2014Cypora\u0027s Guide to Becoming an Evil Queen\u2014is finished! The second draft stage is slogging along, and meanwhile, I\u0027m working on the next part: \u003cstrong\u003eCypora\u0027s Guide to Cementing Your Rule as an Evil Queen\u003c/strong\u003e. To help push that through to completion, i\u0027m asking for your help: even the smallest contribution will make a big difference, especially since I\u0027m only able to find part-time work... and being an autistic queer doesn\u0027t give me a lot of marketable job skills.\u003cbr\u003e"
