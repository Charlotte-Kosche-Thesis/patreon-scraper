I believe that\u0027s exactly how our world works.\u00a0I believe that in life not the guy with most talent who wins, but the guy with most perseverance.\u00a0The one who is relentless to the point of being foolish. Who wouldn\u0027t let go no matter what. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou could be very talented or gifted even, but if you just drift through life, squander your gift and don\u0027t care about reaching your full potential - the most talentless guy, with enough willpower in him, will \u00a0ALWAYS leave you in the dust.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was born in USSR. The \"Iron Curtain\" was still up so there was no comics. Then USSR fell and I discovered Disney cartoons and video games and my life NEVER been the same since. All I ever wanted to do was draw, but my folks sent me to a music school instead... That didn\u0027t workout... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy family loved me dearly but they didn\u0027t give a fuck about my \"hobby\". So I never got any proper training at arts. But I kept drawing... I was awfully bad at it though (still am)... Used to think I have no talent whatsoever. But through thick and thin, drawing was the only thing that would keep me going... (And keept me sane) It was my only escape... My fortress. It\u0027s like no matter how tough things got around me I always felt that as long as I keep drawing, it all will workout at the end... And everything else became insignificant... sometimes even my friends, girlfriends and family...\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still hope that one day I will have a chance to attend a proper art-school... That would be an embarrassing sight considering my age...
