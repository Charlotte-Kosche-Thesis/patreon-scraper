In exchange for your financial support you\u0027ll get \nexclusive access to podcast rewards. \u003cstrong\u003eSee what\u0027s included on the right hand side of this page.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA total win-win! You get bonus content each season and I get your amazing financial support to keep doing this work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy show, Green Is the New Black began as a chance for me to interview my friends and colleagues in the holistic health and alternative medicine world. As my own healing and growth has evolved, so has the show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese days I like to say the podcast as a sampler platter for anyone interested in wellness, spirituality and living a more conscious lifestyle. I\u0027ve interviewed everyone from vegan health coaches, to experts on sweatshops, real life witches and global thought leaders. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach year I create two 20 episode seasons. Each show is 30 minutes long and the majority feature expert interviews. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlong the way I\u0027ve discovered that not only do I love podcasting, I LOVE interviewing people. I\u0027m incredibly nosy and love hearing stories of transformation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an online entrepreneur I\u0027ve also become fascinated with the people who actually *make it*. The ones who don\u0027t just have dreams, they set goals with action steps and then go out and pursue them. They\u0027re not waiting for anyone to come along and give them their big break. They\u0027re creating it for themselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThese are the people I\u0027ll be interviewing in *drum roll please* my very own online talk show! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://greenlighthh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Inspired-By-Ashley-mock-up-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnlike a podcast, creating a talk show involves a whole lot of fancy camera and lighting equipment, editing, wardrobe and so much more. The budget from my (amazing!) producer for just 3 episodes is $7,500. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here\u0027s where I need your help\u003c/strong\u003e: I believe so deeply in this work. I believe that the people I interview on my podcast and the people I\u0027ll interview on my talk show have incredible stories and life lessons to share. They inspire change in people who need it so badly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe they will be the ones who help change the entire world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is personal:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy gift is getting people to open up, share their heartfelt stories and bring it back around to create teachable moments for everyone listing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI joke that #OprahTaughtMe, because she did.
