Our organizational model has become an unusual one, in that the owners of the services we provided are typically not the ones paying for the services they manage. Instead, we\u0027re patronized and given donations by the users of those services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes we get requests to host a server (web, database, game, etc) from a specific person, whether or not we do is evaluated on a case by case basis. What their motives are, how many members they have, their activity level, their concept, whether they have a plan, and other factors. Right now it\u0027s just me doing that but hopefully if we continue to help more groups we will eventually have a group of people doing these types of audits.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyways, we had to keep the [ABSP] initials because of how it\u0027s registered for so many things already, the name isn\u0027t finalized but so far I\u0027ve been working with:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e[ABSP] Accelerated Baremetal Server Platform\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not sold on it yet but it\u0027s the best I could come up with so far.\u003cbr\u003ePlease if you have any suggestions on names that use the initials ABSP share them with us in the Discord group.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e[ABSP] Discord Group\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eNext thing I did was start a small Discord group and have so far only invited a few people.

Our budget is in bad shape, and about to get worse. Basically we have not once hit our goal to cover monthly operating costs and whatever gaps there are in our budget I\u0027ve been personally covering for the past few months, which hasn\u0027t really been any trouble for me at this scale, but if we\u0027re going to keep advancing with [ABSP], and particularly if we want to have stable servers on Blade Symphony\u0027s F2P Launch Day, I think priority #1 for the time being is finding a few more people who have good jobs or good cash flow, and would be interested in helping to support the [ABSP] concept. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll we need is a handful of people who pledge 5$ or 10$ and we\u0027ll be fully prepared for however traffic fluctuates with the launch update, and then ready to take the next step forward in what to do with our platform afterwards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo,\u00a0if you\u0027re reading this and are that person who\u0027s way in the green with their budget, and you like our platform\u0027s concept or play some of the games we support, please consider pledging; we always appreciate it and now you get some rewards too, and we encourage anyone involved in our platform at any level to collaborate with us on Discord, that\u0027d be great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you don\u0027t have even a cent to spare, that\u0027s totally cool, if you have interest in any of the games or groups we support or in our concept, join us and contribute with your ideas on Discord, and if you know anybody who you think is in good shape and would be willing to chip in, you shouldn\u0027t have to sell them on it, just point them to this page and they can decide if it\u0027s the type of thing they\u0027d want to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eOnce again thank you for stopping by,\u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eThank you to anyone who made it to the bottom, but above all:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eThank you for being our Patron!\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e"
