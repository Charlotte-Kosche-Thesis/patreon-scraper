We glimpse fleeting portraits of this mythic woman as each performance twists the mirrors to reflect a new Helen. Written in fragments with brilliant collaborator Megan Cohen, the piece has been performed in ever-changing permutations, in San Francisco and London. I am currently redeveloping it for a solo performance and a 7-actor installation with some exciting new design collaborators.

Inspired by the mysteries of the cosmos and the mysteries of our own minds, we\u0027re looking at how scientific knowledge has displaced humanity from our previous understanding of ourselves. It\u0027s about stars, planets, aliens, neurons, consciousness, and ego. We\u0027ve known for a while now that we\u0027re not the centre of the solar system - and now neuroscience is starting to discover that \"we\" might not even be at the centre of our \"selves\". Whatever those words might mean... This piece is in its early research phase, with some exciting new collaborators.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eAmy Clare Tasker Performance Lab Ltd.\u003c/b\u003e is about to exist!

There are so many things to put into place before we can even start the rehearsal process: people, space, money, and of course the idea itself.\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Helen Project\u003c/em\u003e has been in development 2010, and I\u0027ve been conducting interviews for \u003cem\u003eHome Is Where... \u003c/em\u003esince 2014. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the work could take less time if I wasn\u0027t also doing other jobs for money. That\u0027s where you can help. If I could focus only on these projects, they\u0027d get to the stage much more quickly. And maybe I\u0027d be able to get started on some of my other ideas, too...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat does it mean to support me \"per epiphany?\" Every time I figure something out about how to make my work better, I\u0027ll write a blog post, or make a video explaining what I\u0027ve discovered. If you\u0027re worried I will be having too many epiphanies, you can set a monthly cap so you don\u0027t blow your budget. I\u0027ll only post the important ones, probably 1-5 per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
