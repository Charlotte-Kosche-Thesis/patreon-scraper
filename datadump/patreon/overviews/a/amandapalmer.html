there\u2019s really just no way in today\u2019s marketplace to \u201cmake a profit\u201d from a youtube video with just a few thousand views, or a webcast of a beautiful orchestra show, or a weird animation (which are very time-consuming and expensive to produce) unless you\u2019re a *massive* mainstream artist putting up huge paywalls and/or selling your soul to corporate advertisers. i don\u2019t wanna do that, that\u2019s not who i am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003enow, a little backstory.\u003cbr\u003eback in 2012, when i broke free of my soul-sucking major label and used kickstarter to sell my record \u201ctheatre is evil\u201d (which \u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/amandapalmer/amanda-palmer-the-new-record-art-book-and-tour\"\u003e25,000 people pre-ordered\u003c/a\u003e), people were still getting the gist of crowdfunding and patronage. nowadays people are really getting it: artists need ongoing, reliable support \u2013 akin to a salary in the \u201creal world\u201d \u2013 if they\u2019re going to make it and be happy, working artists. the internet and micropayments are making that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003epatreon is a great platform for organizing this concept, including the huge advantage that patrons on a budget (who can only afford $1 per month) don\u2019t have to worry about getting charged too much, whereas people with a lot to give (i have a few $100 and $1,000 patrons) are also welcome to support, without expecting huge amounts of time-sinking rewards which drain energy from the artist. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei treasure my $1 patrons as much as my $1,000 patrons. it\u2019s like the obama campaign: every goddamn dollar counts. it\u2019s also sort of like NPR (that\u2019s american for \u201cNational Public Radio\u201d, for you foreigners): even though you donate, nobody expects you to be glued and tuned into the radio 24/7 just because you made an annual donation. you donated BECAUSE YOU WANT EVERYONE ELSE to be able to enjoy the top-quality (and free) content that NPR provides. this is a community. everybody pitches in what they can, and i try to keep my content as free as possible, so that EVERYBODY, even the people who cannot afford to be part of this patreon, can enjoy my songwriting and my other artistic undertakings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003emore good news: i\u2019m also able to employ a TON of other artists, which in these dying days of arts-funding feels really wonderful and satisfying. as far as that goes, you\u2019re trusting me to be a curator and choose where to spread your money around, so it trickles into improving the lives of a ton of other artists, creators and makers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ecall me a commun-ist or a social-ist if you want. mostly i\u2019m just an art-ist that thinks that art is for sharing, not for selling.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethis patreon is my starting point, my homebase, my workshop where everything happens in transparent realtime. sometimes i take my finished work and haul it onto the art-wagon and traipse it out into the world marketplace (i.e. i work with real labels/distributors/publicists, etc). i\u2019m planning to do this in 2019 with a GIANT NEW ALBUM. but mostly, those moments are few and far between and don\u2019t cover the rent and the costs of being a full-time artist with a full-time office and a full-time team.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethe feedback from the patrons already gathered here has been SO HELPFUL. my patrons have gotten to know me and my team INTIMATELY; how we work, how i work, how it ALL works. we all talk a lot. even though my team sometimes stumbles in the dark and makes mistakes, and even though not everybody subscribing to the patreon LOVES every little thing i produce (how could they??) this system is working BEAUTIFULLY. It\u2019s HUMAN. i cherish and ponder feedback. we are figuring this system out as we go along. it\u2019s a constant discussion. it\u2019s a tribe. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ei blog A LOT - a few times a week, sometimes more. i talk about everything...my life, the work, my inspirations, my troubles, my process. my blogs get sent out to the patrons automatically by email (if you\u2019ve enabled email notifications), and i ask a lot of questions and i ask for a lot of input and feedback. you\u2019re never expected to answer, but i read every comment, because i care a shit-ton about this community and whether it\u2019s working for everybody.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eif you guys know me, you know i LISTEN. we\u0027re here to make this work, and we will. not a lot of songwriters are using this platform, but more are joining every day, and this community is kind of a trail-blazer, since we are making up the rules as we go along. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eso. whether you\u2019ve been a fan of mine since the days of The Dresden Dolls or whether you\u2019ve just recently found me through my book, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/amanda_palmer_the_art_of_asking\"\u003emy TED talk\u003c/a\u003e (which is about EXACTLY this topic of art and asking) or you\u2019ve stumbled across my songs or videos online, i would love to invite you to join this community and see what we are doing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand if you\u2019re already one of my patrons...THANK YOU. i love you and you are making me possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eand now\u2026..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eALLL THE THIIIIIIIIIIINGS!!!\u003cbr\u003eMOAR THINGS FOREVER!!\u003cbr\u003elet\u0027s DO THIS SHIT.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003elove,\u003cbr\u003eAFP\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.s. one more thing: if you\u0027re not familiar with my music, i\u0027ve made a great primer page to acquaint you, it\u0027s called \"a walk through amandalanda\" and has streams of my biggest records and best videos:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://amandalanda.amandapalmer.net/\"\u003ehttp://amandalanda.amandapalmer.net/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ep.p.s. if you have questions, please submit them on twitter, on facebook, on my blog, or here on the patron stream once you sign up.  you can also read a FAQ (frequently asked questions) on my site, HERE: \u003ca href=\"http://amandapalmer.net/patreonfaq\"\u003ehttp://amandapalmer.net/patreonfaq\u003c/a\u003e or send us an email at \u003ca href=\"mailto:patreonhelp@amandapalmer.net\"\u003epatreonhelp@amandapalmer.net\u003c/a\u003e and we\u2019ll get you sorted.if you\u2019d like more information about How Patreon Works or need help with your patreon account you can view a ton of resources on patreon\u2019s support page and contact their support team directly: \u003ca href=\"http://support.patreon.com\"\u003ehttp://support.patreon.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
