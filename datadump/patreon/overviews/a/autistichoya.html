    "summary": "Since I was a junior in high school, I have been deeply invested and grounded in autistic, neurodiversity, and disability movements and communities. My work is somewhere in the middle of where disability rights and disability justice crash into each other. I am an organizer, advocate, and activist committed to intersectional struggles for life, love, and freedom with/for disabled people at multiple margins. As an autistic and multiply-disabled, queer, agender/nonbinary/genderqueer trans, East Asian transracial and transnational adoptee of color, this work is often about my own survival and refusal to disappear quietly. I\u0027m also a person with quite a bit of privilege, as a U.S. citizen fluent in English, college educated, raised with access to middle and upper-middle class resources, and from an intensely Christian background on Turtle Island, or what most call the United States of America. But even in spaces my privilege has gotten me into, I, like most marginalized folks who have the audacity to simply \u003cem\u003eexist\u003c/em\u003e, have survived more trauma and abuse than anyone should ever have to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the years since I became an accidental advocate, I have published work in many scholarly and community publications, but more importantly, I took the lead in visioning, curating, and creating\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.autismandrace.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eAll the Weight of Our Dreams: On Living Racialized Autism\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e(Lydia X. Z. Brown, E. Ashkenazy, and\u00a0Mor\u00e9nike Giwa Onaiwu, DragonBee Press, 2017), the first-ever anthology of art and writing by autistic people of color and other negatively racialized autistic people. I\u0027ve done quite a bit to push for real access, radical inclusion, and justice that does not rely on the state, law, or institutions to save us -- you can read about much of my public work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.autistichoya.net\"\u003emy portfolio\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0You may have read my work on my blog \u003ca href=\"https://www.autistichoya.com/\"\u003eAutistic Hoya\u003c/a\u003e, which first began as a tiny corner of the internet to share my rambling ideas with a few friends and whichever classmates or family members I could convince to read something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support helps me keep creating writing and projects that support and sustain many folks in communities and many folks isolated from community spaces too. Outside my public-facing work, like speaking and publications, I am constantly doing on-the-ground direct support and mutual aid work, spanning multiple states and sometimes countries, most of which I rarely if ever discuss in public, but all of which costs me significant time, energy, and money that I usually don\u0027t have. Supporting me will help me support many others, directly and indirectly, and will also allow you exclusive content to developing ideas, new blog posts in the making, and perhaps even updates about my fiction (my true heart and passion, going back to my toddler years). Thank you for considering supporting me here!"
