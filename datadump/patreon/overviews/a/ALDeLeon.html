    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for being here and checking out what I\u0027m attempting to accomplish. It means a lot to me that you\u0027re willing to spend a little of your time here :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0A little about me as a person- I go by April and write under the pen name A.L. DeLeon. I am raising three kids on my own, that in itself makes life somewhat complicated but not boring :) \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing as a creative outlet for as long as I can remember. \u00a0I\u0027m also a former non-profit director, so at some point I\u0027m gonna want to do more than writing. I\u0027m also going to want to help others as much as I\u0027m able to. Someday I\u0027d like to start my own non-profit advocating travel, cultural relations, and education. And own my own bookstore... but those are further down the line of goals and dreaming.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e First, I want to get my written work out there, establish myself as an author, and get to know people by sharing these stories of mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of stories do I write, you ask?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write fantasy fiction, occasionally some sci-fi, as well as, poetry every now and again. My first novel, Blue, is expected to be published with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://dragonmoonpress.com/\"\u003eDragon Moon Press\u003c/a\u003e sometime later this year or it may end up being pushed to 2018 (entirely my fault as I need to get the edited draft finished and sent to them over the next few months to be able to make it happen this year).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the thing though, many times my time is diverted from writing because of the need to maintain other sources of income to keep up my daily adult life- making sure my kids and I have a roof over our heads, etc. \u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0This is where Patreon comes in.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will Patreon supporters like you help me do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Finish Blue, book 1 of 3 in a planned trilogy, to be published with Dragon Moon Press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Format and self publish a compilation of poetry that I\u0027ve written over the last 10 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Format, edit, and make available via self publishing a series of short stories I\u0027ve been writing. First I plan to release each individually by e-book and then later to compile them each into one book, tentatively titled the \"Shot Glass Reading Series.\" These short stories will each have a cover illustrated by local artists. In support of their work, I\u0027d like to pay them for their time and efforts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Plan, format, and begin making available a monthly short story magazine online, and then later in print, showcasing work from a multitude of other talented Indie and small press authors, entitled Crimson Whiskey Magazine. I\u0027ll need others to help with this idea and it might take some time to plan out how to publish it, garner work from other authors, and ultimately pay the authors for the work they provide to be included. The same is true for the formatters/editors who will contribute to it as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Reach other goals such as travel for research purposes, upgrade and maintain my author website, attend more writer\u0027s conferences, utilize other tools out there to help me continue to become a better author, be able to participate in events where I can met and engage with readers and patrons like you, and ultimately produce more written works and give back to my community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
