Pierce \u0026amp; I am a self-taught, and new coming painter/ illustrator based in Atlanta. Since age 5 I have been illustrating, but unfortunately stopped in middle School due to how much art was unappreciated in the lower-class communities at the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Fast-forwarding to 2016 I landed a job as a floral designer, in Buckhead Atlanta. My floral job paid well enough, so I was able to afford an apartment near my job. Upon working as a florist, I naturally began illustrating the bouquet arrangement examples that clients would place to help me remember their order \u0026amp; preferred design. That was when my co-workers noticed my illustrations. My boss pulled me aside and asked \"why are you even working here? You\u0027re very talented!\". \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 That\u0027s when my boss and co-workers started to take my illustrations seriously and signed me up for different art events. Fast-forwarding to August 2017, I had a bad knee injury which forced me to take a leave of absence from work. Sitting at home, while freaking out about how I will make ends meet with a physical restriction, I then began illustrating, and painting every single day, and posting it on social media (thanks to my co-workers for re-boosting my bit of confidence) to score a bit of income and to my surprise - people came to me for commissions and inquiries. I instantly fell in love with being an artist, because creating art is so healing. My favorite art subject is portraits. What I love about portraits is they boost the person\u0027s self-confidence, because they can take a look at how beautiful they really are. I mean, I really\u003cstrong\u003e love \u003c/strong\u003ebeing an artist. The money is extremely inconsistent, and often times I am literally starving, but I sacrificed my 9-5 for this, because it brings me so much joy, aesthetic is healing, and I passionately want to help introduce fine arts into local communities by\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ebuilding an affordable Art School.\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e Currently I am beginning to do performing painting shows for little to no cost all around Atlanta at popular restaurants, bars, and clubs, just to introduce myself as an artist and bring visual aesthetic to those who appreciate it. lllustrating and painting are the best gifts that I\u0027ve re-discovered in myself.
