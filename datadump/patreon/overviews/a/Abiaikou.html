(Aka koneko.sensei on Instagram) I\u0027m an otaku,artist,freelance model,collector,cosplayer,and promoter. My Birthday Is September 8th! I\u0027m new to actually having a Patreon account, so I don\u0027t really know how to use it yet. I attempted to start one almost a year ago but gave up. It has been requested by a lot of people that I start one, so I\u0027m going to try this again. Lol! Thanks so much to those who wish to support my work. None of this would be possible without those who have donated or sponsored cosplays and shoots. I appreciate it so much, and don\u0027t know where I would be without all of you. Some people have even helped me during some really hard times with non-cosplay related things. Thanks to those who help my dreams became a reality. Bringing the characters I love so much to life brings me so much joy and excitement. I always look forward to it. I hope that maybe I\u0027ll be able to attend more cons as well in the future if this gets enough support to do so. I would love to meet more of my friends and fans.
