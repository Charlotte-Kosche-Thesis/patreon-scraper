I\u0027m a lover, a fighter and someone who takes great pride in being part of a likeminded community of creators.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd right now, I need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter news of the Stanford Rape Case broke last June, I read Emily Doe\u0027s brave letter. Like many, I was shocked and angered, but inspired by her words. I was moved to write a play called \u003cem\u003eThe Flora and Fauna\u003c/em\u003e, inspired by a single line from her letter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe play went on to have a few developmental readings, and several theatre companies expressed interest in staging it as a full production. Then it began to win awards, two of them so far, while in contention for even more.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe play details the friendship of two women, over a 28-year period, through all their dramas and quiet moments, ups and downs, as they live messy and complicated lives in process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have several amazing opportunities coming up for it, including a New York production, but need some cash to get us there. Anything you can offer will help us get a new dialogue started, where people are free to share their own experiences of trauma in the talkbacks, and even work toward healing as the play moves on to San Francisco, Chicago and Boston.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be posting a video soon, but here\u0027s my bio, to show you what I\u0027ve done before. The photo above is from a recent workshop of the play.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlyson Mead\u003c/strong\u003e studied\nat Yale, the Slade School of Art in London, NYU\u2019s Tisch School of the Arts and\nwith iO West, UCB and Tectonic Theatre Project.
