    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there. I go around on these here internets as Ash Pana, and I love stories.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love watching them, I love reading them, and I love making them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a good 2.5 years, I was forging Fandom Fix, an all official shop that sold comics, anime, manga, and art supplies. I needed to make work, and I love stories that challenge the norm. Seemed like a good Idea. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, the same thing that led to me needing to create my own business for work has led me to close it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have Fibromyalgia (and possibly something else, blood tests are pending) and I\u0027ve had it and a horomone disorder since I was 13. I have a severe case, and I\u0027ve been getting worse over the last two years. It\u0027s completely ruined my chances at finding steady work. I\u0027m currently at a point in my life where I wear myself out completely doing normal things like laundry and in-town travel. I\u0027m... not even going to get into the amount of pain I usually deal with.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why are you here exactly?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause I have stories I think are worth sharing, and I want them out there in less than 5 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlack women that aren\u0027t stereotypes, transwomen and lesbians that aren\u0027t brutally murdered, bi/pan characters that aren\u0027t rapists and cheaters, representative characters that are something other than an afterthought- these are things you shouldn\u0027t have to go to Mordor to find. These are things I am actively working with and making RIGHT NOW.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou deserve stories that have people like you in them. You deserve the things I have in my stories, and I need to pay for the stuff that\u0027ll keep me at a decent quality of life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am currently working on 3 different sets of speculative fiction Light Novels, as well as the occasional short story/novella. (I will update in a few days with the summary of the two sets I\u0027m most focused on at the moment.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs things stand I\u0027ll be premiering my work project Patreon in Mid-Late June after my blood tests come back and I can work out what my schedule will be like. THAT WILL BE A JOB THOUGH, and I will treat it as such. In the meantime, and even once it premiers, this Patreon will let me get some steady help with my expenses, which lets me give more resources and spoons to these stories.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo what do I get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis patreon is what will let me focus on my creative work- writing, art, graphical experiments- all related to my ongoing works in progress. In exchange for your kind donations, you get access to EVERYTHING in the stream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want something more- I\u0027m an author and I need a beta/sensitivity reader, but I\u0027m on a budget.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNo problem! I have a tier specifically for that. In exchange for your continuing monthly support, I have reduced rates on my beta and sensitivity reading services, which include-\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA complete first impressions read-through with annotations on language, characters, and flow\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA second read-through with further suggestions on material that\u0027s not up to shooting star standards yet, as well as annotations on revisions you may have made or notes you have given me after the first read-through\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eA summary of each section/chapter based on my first read through that you can compare to your own notes\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eI\u0027ll be adding a smaller tier for that based on user suggestion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYeah.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you. You choosing to even check this out means the world to me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have any questions about any of this, send me an email at: SoMuchPanAsh@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGood Luck, and Good Resting,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAsh.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
