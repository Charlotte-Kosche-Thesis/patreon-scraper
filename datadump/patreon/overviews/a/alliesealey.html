     "about": "Music has given me the reason to push forward and move\nthrough certain trials and tribulations in life. I have been writing since my\nearliest recollections and jamming to Lynyrd Skynyrd any chance I had. I used\nto listen to Lynyrd Skynyrd on cassette tape while on long drives with my dad\nand I would always make him turn it up to listen to \u201cCurtis Loew\u201d . I could\nhave never in my wildest imagination dreamt that one day Lynyrd Skynyrd would\nshare my cover of \u201cWrite it in A Song\u201d on their Facebook page coupled with the\nnicest article I have read about my voice. I started learning the flute when I\nwas in elementary school and I would knock on my neighbors\u2019 door with my flute\nstand in hand and ask them if they wanted a free show. I would set up my\nstuffed animals as an audience and sing to them in my room before bed. For some\nreason, I was fearful to break out of my shell and declare myself a singer. I\nfelt like there is such a negative connotation associated with that description\nand it almost feels limiting. It wasn\u2019t until people began to make a fuss about\nmy voice that I started to have more confidence to take my passion outside of\nmy bedroom. I bought my first guitar (which got stolen out of my 1992 Chevy\nSilverado) and I would learn to strum chords and play. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI lived with my grandfather for many years and we helped\neach other. He was a phenomenal father to me, but more importantly my best\nfriend. We were the greatest friends and exceeded every expectation of what a\nrelationship should be. He listened to me suck really bad at the guitar for a\nlong time and he continued to encourage my music. He was the best audience I\nhave ever had the privilege to play for. He would mute the television and give\nme all his attention. Sometimes he would even cry because he was so proud. When\nmy grandpa asked me to call Hospice this year, we made sure this was the best\ndecision for him and I knew he was truly ready. When the Hospice nurse came\ninto our house, she asked my grandpa whom his favorite singer was. He looked\nright up at me and said, \u201cWell, you\u2019re looking at her.\u201d I thought the next\nweeks were the hardest part of my life leading up to his final day with me.\nThat night I asked him if he wanted me to play for him and he reached to the\nremote and turned off the television. I played him what was to be the last\nthree songs I would play for him in our home and they were, \u201cFly Me to the\nMoon\u201d by Frank Sinatra, \u201cBecause You Loved Me\u201d by Celine Dion, and \u201cStars\u201d by\nGrace Potter. The last thing that went through my mind was, \u201cWho am I going to\nplay for now?\u201d",
