    "summary": "Thanks so much for taking this next step in supporting us! If you don\u0027t know who we are and what we do... this is it. We travel full time in a 29ft RV playing music at Universities/Colleges, house shows, restaurants, coffee shops, festivals and other venues across the country. We release vlogs every time we do something worth sharing!!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat keeps us being able to do this for a living is four hour cover shows every night in different bars and restaurants. They are the ones with the money. This has been great and we\u0027re so thankful for where it has brought us, however, we are trying to do more original music gigs... shows where people can really see who \"Arbour Season (formally known as Shane \u0026amp; Emily)\" are and what we do. We are ok with playing covers for the rest of our life but while we have the energy and the will power, we\u0027re chasing our dreams of getting our original music in the hands of everyone we can!! Unfortunately, the venues that help us get there, don\u0027t pay much if anything at all. So this is where you come in. With your help, we are able to put ALL our energy into creating, writing and playing gigs that will promote strictly \"Arbour Season\" material.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything that we post will be able to be viewed for free on YouTube however you see it first. If you are donating $1, $2 or $50 per video (which we only post once in a while), it will only be because you want to support us! We will love and appreciate you no matter what! So there is no pressure!! \ud83d\ude3a\ud83d\ude3a!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Thank you for following us on this journey and we hope to see you on the road!!! - Arbour Season"
