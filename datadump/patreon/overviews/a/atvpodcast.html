Who sits down to watch a certain TV show at a specific time any more? Who can even keep track of what\u2019s worth watching and what\u2019s terrible when there\u2019s just so much TV out there? \u003cbr\u003e\nWe can! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, we try. Well, we try to try. Sometimes we\u0027re talking about big-name TV and new fall premieres, but just as often we talk about ancient TV no one watches any more, OR we have big conversations about TV and the world, OR we discuss the ethics of reality television, OR we argue about the best kind of TV to watch in a hotel. We dive into broad topics like reboots, romances, pilots and politics. Many TV podcasts focus their attention on a single show, diving deep into familiar topics every week; we prefer to be TV generalists, helping you to figure out what to watch when you\u0027re between shows and have an hour or two to kill.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u2019ve been making Appointment Television for two years now, and we love doing it. But in order to grow and bring you better podcasts, worse puns, and more great TV coverage, we need some support. We\u2019d like to upgrade our recording equipment, we\u2019d love to have more listener interaction, we\u0027d like to talk to people who make the TV we love, and mostly we\u2019d love to cover our current costs (like web hosting and subscriptions and Margaret\u2019s podcast juice supply). (Just kidding about the last part). \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOne of our very favorite things to hear from listeners is that you like hanging out with us each week. We love being able to bring you that friendship, experience, pedantry, goofiness, occasional teasing, and sheer, unadulterated love of television. Your support will help us keep doing it, and doing it better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNew to the show? Here\u0027s what our listeners think!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\"This show is hilarious, informative, and entertaining.
