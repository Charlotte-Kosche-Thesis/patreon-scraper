    "summary": "Hi! Welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I do here?\u003c/strong\u003e I draw and paint. I also world-build and create stories. And I teach. Yes, you are most welcome to look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy am I collecting funds here?\u003c/strong\u003e Because I have a calling (art and illustration), and a ton of projects I want to finish and publish (comics, picture books, even animations), and Patreon is a way to support that and bring the projects to completion, without selling myself out. Every dollar is accepted gratefully, with full realization that you are enabling me to do the best work and live the dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is also the matter of feedback. Here I can feel the support of my audience, and find out what things you want to see more! I feel that a person who had chipped in has a closer interest in a creative project than a random passer-by, so discussing creative projects with someone who donated money to see them completed is more productive than just posting sketches on social networks. Of course, the results are posted for all to see; but the behind-the-scenes work is going on here, and you are welcome to participate in that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/strong\u003e It works like a subscription. Patreon lets you \"pledge\" money in return for monthly rewards. The smallest reward is a look into my creative process and an opportunity to participate in it. Bigger pledges get more rewards. The more pledges I get, the more time I can spend on giving the art back to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it like Kickstarter/Indiegogo? \u003c/strong\u003eNot quite. Kickstarter is about funding a single big project. Patreon is about supporting a creator with ongoing projects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat kinds of projects am I developing? \u003c/strong\u003eFine art, picture books (\u003cem\u003eIf There Were Witches\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eCaptain Nemo and the Finest Fish in the Sea\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eI Can Fly to the Moon\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eRiver, Otter and a Fishing Rod\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eA Window Mouse Tale\u003c/em\u003e...), graphic novellas (\u003cem\u003eBeyond the Pale\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eLeviathan\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eTrek\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eGodmakers\u003c/em\u003e...). \u003cem\u003eThe Goodbye Puppy\u003c/em\u003e is a joint project of a web comic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs there a paywall?\u003c/strong\u003e Not really. I have published art for years for all to see, and I never made a secret\u00a0 out of my working process. You\u0027ll see most of it eventually even if you do not pay. But getting on the exclusive content list means you\u0027ll get the art done sooner, and get sketches, previews, higher resolution files, and talk about them before anyone else sees them. There are also reward tiers that give you digital downloads, discounts on products, credit in books, and custom art!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWould I be doing it without payment?\u003c/strong\u003e Absolutely. I would just have to do it less, because I\u0027d have to take more potboiler projects in programming, design, and even illustration instead of developing what matters to me. The more I can make on Patreon, the more I can focus on the work of love and help other people do the same. And I have a firm belief that that benefits everyone. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy monthly instead of per-project subscription?\u003c/strong\u003e Because I typically work on two or three projects in parallel - it is my way to not burn out. Per-project funding would be impractical. Monthly funding also helps keep my mind on creative work and not on how to make ends meet next month. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you help in more ways?\u003c/strong\u003e Of course you can! Share my work (and this page) on social networks, put likes on my artwork, recommend it to your friends! It all helps a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan you buy or commission art from me outside of Patreon? \u003c/strong\u003eOf course you can. Contact me for details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGot a question not covered here? \u003c/strong\u003eYou are most welcome to ask!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere else can you find me? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMain site: \u003ca href=\"http://chiseledrocks.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echiseledrocks.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/arenhaus\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://facebook.com/arenhaus\u003c/a\u003e"
