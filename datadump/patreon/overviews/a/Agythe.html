A year ago I had a fall down flights of concrete stairs and suffered from both accidents with Multiple Traumatic brain injuries. With this second, well there were more I think. I lost about eight years of memory from two thousand sixteen to two thousand eight. I was a professional voice actor and animator/ modeler somewhere in that time frame, from what I have heard.\u003cbr\u003ewell I am just being able to start doing things I like  again. I have had to learn to type, write, draw.. everything. I\u0027m getting back into voice acting and auditioning and re learning animation and modeling with Maya. I found this site and it\u0027s SUCH a blessing. I am unable to keep any traditional kind of work, 6Interviews in last 2 months, lets just say the corporate world is not patient by any means, I am in Vocational rehab so I can learn to work other jobs, but they DO NOT  help with creative or any kind of talent work.(SO we get blessed with him, instead of people who don\u0027t appreciate him.) I struggle with REALLY simple things, even the things I enjoy so it has been difficult. At least with the things I love I get enjoyment not just a paycheck, but that too is VERY important. So I have taken matters into my own hands to find help... However If I can get paid by those that love my stuff from before and things I\u0027m creating now... this would truly be the answer I\u0027ve been looking for...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAbout my Future Wants\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e(\"It\u0027s good to have wants and needs\")\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make a game about mental illness and brain trauma  and how it strengthens us... not making us weak and inferior. (Long term Goal) Take my struggles and countless others and relay that info in a beautiful way. I plan to re learn and patrons can learn with me... I\u0027m interested in 3D animation, voice acting and 3D modeling... and all the in between. Ive wanted to be a game designer since I was eight years old... had a teacher say I will never amount to anything... with your help... We will prove her wrong. And also be able to do more what I love and not be as stressed having to relearn to do work that doesn\u0027t challenge me the way I want and make money for a corporation... I could put money I make into creating more. For instance there are workshops for voice acting and programs for learning  3D and also to get roles when I am a better actor than I already am (I am decent, {He\u0027s REALLY good and modest.}) I need better Equipment and quality sound Isolation, like a sound booth or a sound cube. These cost anywhere from $50  to $2,000 to  $3,000... even more. Help me re find and discover my talents together, by allowing me to learn and have better programs and equipment.. \u003cbr\u003eThis will also allow me to do more for/with my kids.. my son is an amazing gamer and he is very young.. When I get him AND my daughter creating things with me.. (they\u0027ll be here eventually, depending on our busy schedules).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Past work and the upcoming\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll post things I know I\u0027ve done because family has tried to get me to remember... I also want to drum again, not now, but I\u0027d love to get back into percussion. THAT I remember how to do, just been since high school... who knows with your monthly help I could discover more things I can do and you will have a front row seat. Grab your seat and watch what we can create together. I will Constantly communicate and do polls on things and Ideas or what you want me to learn first( preference is 3D, voice acting and the rest..) maybe you can not only help me monetarily but ALSO any ideas anyone has... I will give consideration and credit when due, I know we can make the world a better place with my imagination, and my kids imagination, HEY even yours!... we just need  a little help. Love you!
