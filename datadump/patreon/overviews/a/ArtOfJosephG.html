My \"Lunchtime Sketches\", are free 40 minute pencil sketches of any and all requests. I am open to all genres, but most of the sketch requests have been for people\u0027s tabletop RPG characters. At its peak, I was able to complete at least one sketch a day but financial obligations have forced me to take on a second job after my primary full-time day job. Now to continue any kind of art, I use my lunches at work to complete commissioned artwork.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0For those of you who have received, or just enjoyed, any of the hundreds of free \"Lunchtime Sketches\" over the years, please donate whatever you can. Anything you can donate will be greatly appreciated, and will help keep the free art flowing!\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"

I specialize in high contrast, grayscale, pencil drawings, and pen and ink line work. I\u0027ve received some general art schooling at the high school level, however I\u0027m primarily self-taught. In my youth I was heavily influenced by the artists of comic books, emulating their styles as I was attracted to the bold imagery they displayed. As I grew I came to realize that the pieces that could tell a story and convey the subjects emotion were the ones that captured my imagination. As much as  I love creating these works, I aim to be a storyteller first. \u003cbr\u003eSee more of my work here...\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/artofjosephgarcia\"\u003ewww.facebook.com/artofjosephgarcia\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eJoseph G\u003cbr\u003e",
