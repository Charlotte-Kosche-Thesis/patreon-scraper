    "summary": "Howdy! I\u0027m AlfonZo Rachel, feel free to call me Zo, if ya like! The works I\u0027m most known for are video commentaries where I make observations on politics, faith, and culture from a christian conservative angle. I\u0027ve been blessed in that my commentaries are kindly received as both humorous and deeply thought provoking. My videos were featured on PJTV as ZoNation. Now I self publish my videos as the Zo Loft, and also a live session called Bible Trippin\u0027 which is a casual yet lively reading of the Bible one chapter at a time! I\u0027m also the founder of the hard rock band 20 lb Sledge. I\u0027m working on producing other teleplays and hopefully up to 90 page productions. All works are under my production moniker \"Bronze Serpent Media\" My objective is to create media that counters the narratives that keep us in a state of discontent, keep us bitter and divided, that influence the rejection of God and despising our republic. By supporting my work it helps show that there is a demand and a market for such content to hopefully become a viable competitor with the entertainment industry that influences more and more cultural decline. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWith your support\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe can go beyond just commentary, (which I\u0027ll still do) but we can take these ideals and put them in the mediums that have been used to influence the culture; music, movies, T.V. shows.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe can produce music that doesn\u0027t depend on half naked lewd women to sell them, or men singing about women as four letter words or four legged animals.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMusic that\u0027s just as groovy and deep, but with lyrics that don\u0027t sound like they were written with a syringe.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe can produce movies with style and gusto, without promoting the mind rotting narratives too often pushed through movies, or relying on smut that often gets in the way of what could have been a descent film.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWe can produce teleplays; sit-coms, psychological anthologies, dramas, animation, sci-fi etc. The Bible especially has the potential for mind blowing renderings if we would explore the God given creativity to do it while not being deviant with it.\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is my objective. For now I\u0027m able to do commentaries. With your support we can also achieve the aforementioned and help liberate the culture from the corrosive content that\u0027s eating away at the soul of the culture. It\u0027s just making them more and more bitter. Hope you\u0027ll support!\u00a0Thanks and God bless ya!\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
