    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Kevin Bunch, I\u0027m a journalist and writer by trade with a decades-long interest in the early years of video game history. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s all well and good, but what are you doing on Patreon talking about video games?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt struck me over the years how readily stories about the first days of the video game industry were forgotten, overlooked, warped, or simply unknown. Part of this can simply be chalked up to limited coverage in magazines, newspapers, and periodicals; what coverage there was is often inaccessible without a research library or collecting physical copies. At the same time, many of the people who were there at the time - either making games, working for these companies, or even reporting on the industry - are getting older. We are losing opportunities to learn firsthand about the nature of the games industry in the 1970s and 80s. That\u0027s where Atari Archive comes in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you do in these videos?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis video series is primarily a chronological peak into each game on the Atari 2600 platform, from Combat to Ikari Warriors. Sure, for years now one could readily download a ROM file from the internet, play it for a few minutes, decide whether or not they like the game, and then move on. But I think that context is key to these games. Each video digs into the development of each game (including talking with the developers where possible), its contemporary coverage, what trends, events, and rival games surrounded its release, and what kind of impact it might have had, if any. Whenever possible I\u0027m trying to get video output directly from the actual hardware, upscaled to 720p at 60 frames per second to give you an idea of what these games looked like when they released without replacing your computer screen with an old CRT television.\u00a0My goal is a minimum of one video a month, though I\u0027d love to ramp that up to multiple videos per month with your backing. \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo_f7y6sBDmFnGbZoq1Ce_w/feed?ab_channel=AtariArchive\"\u003eYou can find the YouTube channel here\u003c/a\u003e, and I am interested in backing them up on Archive.org in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe 2600 is good and all, but what about other platforms?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBeyond the 2600, I\u0027d like to create some \"Archive Annex\" videos digging into the tales and history of other platforms, such as the Mattel Intellivison, the RCA Studio II, and the Bally Professional Arcade. Ambitious? Definitely - it\u0027s time consuming to research these games, especially when it requires a trip to a research library to dive into old newspaper archives, magazines, or even surviving internal memos and paperwork. Funding for research trips would be incredibly helpful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd hey, I don\u0027t want to stop there. I\u0027d like to put my Patreon funds back into this project: try and get some final pieces of hardware I don\u0027t have to expand my coverage, open up a website specific to the Atari Archive, or pursue publishing my research in a full book down the line.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you like what I\u0027m doing, and also think it\u0027s important to make sure this bit of history isn\u0027t lost to time, then consider backing the Archive."
