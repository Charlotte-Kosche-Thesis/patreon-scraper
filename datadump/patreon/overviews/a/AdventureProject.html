Unfortunately our ship passed by many of the islands I longed to see.\u00a0 After completing my tour of duty\u003cimg src=\"https://thestoryboat.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/cropped-story-sailboat-header.jpg\"\u003e I opened a Dive shop in California. We thought SCUBA classes and\ntook our customers to exotic places like the Bahamas, Honduras,\nMexico and to Fiji.  Fiji was fantastic and I made sure that we\nreturned many times to those fantastic islands. Once again I was tied\nto a schedule and could not explore the islands out on the horizon. \nNow I have a 38 foot blue water cruising sail boat that can take me to\nthe islands on the horizon.  For the past three years we have been\npreparing the boat for the journey across the Pacific. We have also\nbeen preparing ourselves by completing many many courses  on sailing\nsuch as  mechanics, first aid, electronics, weather, plumbing, and\nnavigation and several more.\u003cbr\u003e\nWe are fast approaching a departure\ndate, sometime near the end of 2018 we hope to untie the dock line\nfor the last time in California and set sail for those islands on the\nhorizon.. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSHb6FyUp5Ok76Vq3mNj-iwEqfDZQjFHkhH9o4BV_qjbBEIng4gOA\" style=\"width: 398px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\tI also have a personal mission while\non this journey. While in Fiji I discovered a need that has not been\naddressed.  The old folks on the islands are in serious need of\nreading glasses.  So far we have  handed out about 2000 pair of reading\nglasses to old \u003cimg\u003efolks.  Their faces brighten up when they can see clearly\nagain. I plan to fill up the boat with as many reading glasses and\njust give them away as we sail from island to island.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for joining us on this ocean\nadventure. Stay tuned, much more to come.\u003cbr\u003e"
