Formed from the alliance of three film, media, and entertainment companies, A Stranger Concept strives to bring the very best in truly independent cinema, prioritizing artistic vision and creative freedom over the suffocation of the status quo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur History:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFounded in 2015 from the collaborative efforts of Nerd Nation Entertainment, 13th Floor EFX, and SingleCell Productions, A Stranger Concept Films first began its collective journey into the world of independent film-making with the release of 2015\u2019s \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who: Lucky 13\u003c/em\u003e, a non-profit charity fan film project inspired by BBC\u2019s \u003cem\u003eDoctor Who\u003c/em\u003e franchise. By 2016 they had released their first original short film, \u003cem\u003eThe Devil\u2019s Lettuce\u003c/em\u003e, a comedic parody of the propaganda PSA films of the 1940s and 1950s, which went on to win over a dozen awards on the film festival circuit throughout 2016 and 2017, and earned a humble cult following. During this time, A Stranger Concept expanded to incorporate Jacob Nobody Productions, bringing more talented individuals into the fold. In late 2017 they completed work on Closing Time, a horror/suspense short film by writer Dave Harlequin, based on his eponymous novella. Closing Time went on to be the collective\u2019s most successful film to date, taking home multiple festival awards, including the top honor of \u003cem\u003e\u201cBest in Show\u201d\u003c/em\u003e at both the 2017 Big Fandom Film Festival and 2018 Mysticon Independent Film Festival as it continues to tour the film festival circuit today. Currently, A Stranger Concept are in pre-production development of no less than four upcoming films being shot this year, as well as others already slated for 2019 and beyond.",
