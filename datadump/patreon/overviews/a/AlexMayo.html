    "summary": "Hi! I\u0027m Alex. A while back I was fairly active in the podcasting scene, hosting a handful of podcasts...mostly gaming related. Through those podcasts I met a lot of great people and actually managed to get my foot in the door as a working freelancer in the game industry. I\u0027ve been doing that for the last few years and in a weird way it\u0027s led me back to podcasting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast year the thought hit me - why not do a podcast about what you do? That is, a podcast about the design of games...meaning the process of getting the manuscript for a game or gaming product and turning it into a book? Once I started turning the idea over in my head it opened up all kinds of possibilities...I could talk about everything from the business of freelancing to what inspires my favorite artists. My life took some odd and discouraging turns before the year was out and I had to buckle down and take care of some things, but the idea for this podcast would not go away. So - a year later, here I am.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpellCheck\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e will be recorded in 12 episode \u0027seasons\u0027. The current Patreon campaign is to help fund season one. Subsequent episodes will follow approximately every two weeks. Then I plan to take a break of eight weeks before starting on season two. I figure this schedule will allow me to put out a decent amount of quality content at a pace which won\u0027t strangle my ability to take care of my daily routine and have something resembling a social life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m incredibly enthusiastic to be starting this venture - the topic of \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSpellCheck\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e is something I\u0027m deeply enthusiastic about and I believe it will both give me an excuse to chat with a lot of people whose work I admire and deliver something to the gaming community that is so close to my heart.\u003cbr\u003e"
