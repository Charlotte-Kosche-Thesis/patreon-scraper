Thank you for stopping by!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003eWho is Alignment Monkey?\u003c/span\u003e I\u0027m Barbara Loomis A.K.A. Alignment Monkey. But chance\u0027s are you\u0027re here because you already know who I am. But just in case you don\u0027t, allow me to introduce myself....\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI have 20 years of experience and training in the natural health field. I\u0027m trained in four forms of abdominal therapy! It\u0027s safe to say, I love the belly and the internal organs! I\u0027m a certified educator and practitioner of the Arvigo Techniques of Maya Abdominal Therapy\u00ae and Chi Nei Tsang (Chinese Abdominal Therapy) as well as a Visceral Manipulation\u2122 practitioner and a Wise Earth Ayurvedic practitioner specializing in woman\u0027s health. I\u0027ve also certified with Nutritious Movement\u2122 in restorative exercise.\u00a0I have a heartfelt enthusiasm for teaching people how to care for their reproductive and digestive organs as well as teaching natural movement for pelvic floor and abdominal health. What lights me up is to see people connect with the inner beauty and wisdom of their bodies. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003eWhy the Alignment Monkey name?\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0I started my Alignment Monkey blog several years ago as a way to share self-care tools and anatomy and physiology education. I chose the word Alignment because I was studying the effects of alignment (or lack of alignment) on whole body health and function. Alignment also represents my desire for my heart, mind, and body to move in alignment with my soul\u2019s desire. I chose the word Monkey because I like to be silly (as you will see in some of my videos), my Chinese astrology sign is the Earth Monkey and my husband calls me monkey, especially in regards to my wrestling style. So, Alignment Monkey was born. I also like the idea of a Monkey Troop that works and plays together in a supportive community, which is why I\u0027m inviting you to be a valued member of the Alignment Monkey Troop. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u00a0I joined Patreon because I needed a way to make learning affordable to more people around the world regardless of their income level, without exhausting my own resources. Putting quality content out into the world takes time and money.\u00a0I\u0027ve been sharing free content on my blog since 2011. I love doing so, but I\u0027m struggling with keeping up with helping the many people who reach out to me for online support. I receive countless emails from women around the world requesting help for their painful periods, fertility challenges, tipped uteri, digestive complaints, pelvic floor issues and diastasis recti. Patreon allows me a way to continue to blog and make videos that empower women to take charge of their health in an affordable and fun way. \u003cbr\u003eAs an Alignment Monkey patron, you will also help me raise enough money to hire the appropriate help I need to get my online reproductive and digestive health courses out into the world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003eMy big picture goals are:\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eto empower women across the globe with the tools to take control of their health.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eto build a community where women support and learn from each other.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eto change the negative narrative around menstruation, from \" a curse\" to a blessing and source of female power.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(183, 221, 232);\"\u003eWhat I offer:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSelf-Care techniques for reproductive health\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSelf-Care techniques for digestive health\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLifestyle, movement, and restorative exercise\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSelf-Care Techniques include self-abdominal massage, easy to implement lifestyle shifts, Chi Nei Tsang (Chinese Abdominal Therapy), how to test yourself for Flower Essences and how to make your own formulas, herbal education, how to work with stored emotions and more!
