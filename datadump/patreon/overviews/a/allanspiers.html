     "about": "I was born in Lima, Peru and moved with my mom to the U.S. when I was 13 years old with the hope of fiding a better future for me. After attending high school in California, I moved to Florida, where I acquired a job as a graphic artist. I witnessed my hobby of designing advertisements and web pages turn into an art form of its own. I determined it was time to finally make my hobby, my art, into a business.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s when I founded my graphic design company Digital Fuel Studios, Inc. Since 1997, I have had the privilege to have worked with over 700 clients and worked on over 10,000 projects worldwide. After years of admiring most of the stock photography used during my career, I decided to challenge my artistic abilities and began to explore the world of photography. I started my professional photography business in 2001, and I quickly showed the ability to capture my subject\u0027s inner beauty and emotion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2004, I moved to Chicago, where I still reside and where my passion for photography has flourished. I feel extremely fortunate to have a career that I absolutely love and am passionate about.\u003cbr\u003e",
