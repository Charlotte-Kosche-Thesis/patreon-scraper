    "summary": "Hello! This is where I\u0027m supposed to talk about what I\u0027m doing and why you should pledge your support. Well, here goes:\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 I grew up reading comic strips. As I got older, I started to notice them getting smaller and smaller and this made me sad. It was the best part of the newspaper! \u00a0Did you know that once upon a time, each comic strip used a half a page of the newspaper?! The artwork was big and bold and b.e.a.utiful. This led me into loving comic books and graphic novels. These guys had all the room in the world to envision their story;a lot of freedom to tell a story.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 So, here\u0027s the pitch: a book of comic strips. Each \"strip\" gets a whole page to itself to run its own or build on the previous gag. \u00a0Ideally, this would end up being packaged in two formats: a b\u0026amp;w graphic novel, and as a coloring book; because everybody loves coloring books. \u00a0I\u0027ll do roughly one page a week and post a video drawing the final draft and inking. Your donations will go toward supplies to keep making the story. Any donations beyond that, will go toward allowing me to focus on providing you with more art and more stories. The more donations: the more entertaining I can do, so share and encourage your friends, families, coworkers, complete strangers....... You get the idea. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 The story: \u00a0Five robots have crash landed on a new planet they\u0027ve been sent to explore. Memories jumbled, 4 of them think they are in charge, leaving the 5th to do all the work. This is the ongoing comical (see what I did there?) story of their survival and growth as they stumble through the history of the strange planet they \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Found: \"Earth\"."

     "about": "When I was really young, my parents bought me a collection of Garfield comic strips. I grew up reading the comics page in the local newspaper and began to notice that the images were shrinking. \u00a0The comics were actually getting smaller and smaller! \u00a0I loved the stories and that the readers had the opportunity to get connected to these characters over time, but the artwork was losing its impact with the size reductions. \u00a0Go back and look at the \"funny pages\" from the first half of the 20th century, each comic took up half a page! The art was allowed to make an impact as well as the words. They. Were. Beautiful. \u00a0In my teens I began collecting comic books, and was introduced to the idea of graphic novels. They reminded me of the old funny pages, there was room to let the art in on the story telling as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThats what I rely like about art: telling stories.\u00a0",
