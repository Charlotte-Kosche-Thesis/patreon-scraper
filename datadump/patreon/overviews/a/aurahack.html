My name is Erica June, though you probably know me best as \u2018aurahack\u2019.\u00a0I\u2019m an illustrator and designer from Montr\u00e9al, Canada. I\u2019ve been a full-time game developer for close to 5 years and a freelance illustrator for 3. In 2015, I set myself the goal of drawing one 30-40 minute warmup painting every weekday and I\u2019ve continued the streak since, recently surpassing my 300th warmup! I\u2019ve learned a lot in that time, and now I want to put that to good use.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy goal with this Patreon is to do more. To keep making warmups, to do more character art, more concept art, more doodles, more streams. Over the course of my time as a freelancer and game developer, I\u2019ve realised my heart lies with my fans and making things for you, with the eventual goal of being self-sufficient so I can do that full-time. I hope you\u2019ll help me make that a reality!\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSo what will you be doing on here?\u003c/h4\u003e\nArt! So much art! My warmups will continue every morning with various means to enjoy them. High res files, PSDs, videos\u2014all that good stuff.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019ll also be diving more into fan art and character art. You\u2019ll be able to suggest and vote on new characters you\u2019d like to see and as this all grows to help support me, I\u2019ll be able to spend the time on more of this, which I absolutely love doing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, I will still be doing larger-scale projects and environment art. That, concept art, illustrations, thumbnails, random night drawings, streaming--that will still all continue and grow with the time I can dedicate to this.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo yeah, art. A lot of it, all for you. \u0026lt;3\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat cool bonuses do I get for supporting you?\u003c/h4\u003e\nHigh resolution files of everything! PSDs! The ability to vote/suggest characters and ideas! Videos! Backer-exclusive prints! Feedback! And this is just to start\u2014I have other ideas and I\u2019ll be able to expand on them as you help this Patreon grow. Things like better videos, tutorial streams--I would love to start teaching as much as drawing, because there\u2019s nothing I love more than seeing my fans get inspired by what I do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eAlright, I\u2019m in\u003c/h4\u003e\nYay, thank you! \u0026lt;3\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSupporting me here will help me do more and better art for everyone, but especially you. As I grow here, I\u2019ll be able to dedicate more time to this and I hope you will help take me there. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/7969301\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/T8LhNbS.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/aurahack\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/YJ9EbUa.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://pixiv.me/aurahack\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vcccCo6.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://tightenupthe.graphics\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/aKSxAiK.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
