I have been struggling in various roles I just do not fit and suffering for it; until I said, screw it, let\u0027s break into comic books! If nobody is going to help me the old-fashioned way of going to school and undergoing portfolio review, I\u0027m just going to do it myself!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI create surrealist illustrations with themes of mental illness and inner strength, and I write, draw, and publish my own comics. At the moment, I am publishing my first major endeavor into comic books, \u003cem\u003eSon of Dawn\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon and by buying reproductions and goods from my web store, you are directly supporting me in my goal of comics as a full time job and growing my business as an arts creator.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy should you support me? Don\u0027t most webcomics go on hiatus, with no end in sight?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s incredibly frustrating when this happens, but do understand that for a lot of people who run webcomics, it\u0027s not a lack of ethic that kills the comic, it\u0027s life happening; that\u0027s why I work on this comic in large chunks at a time, having entire chapters finished, ready to go, and scheduled weeks in advance. If life does happen, there won\u0027t be any discernible difference in quality or updates, as I have taken measures to ensure each update goes live on time! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time!!"
