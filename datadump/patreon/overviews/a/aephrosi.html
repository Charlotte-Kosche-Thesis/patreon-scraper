However, I would \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eto be able to hire some folks to make progress faster. \u00a0Maybe you\u0027d be willing to help?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eStory\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027re the runt child of the Succubus Vizier.  All your siblings are recently dead and you\u0027re the only remaining heir.  You need to prove yourself through training in secret with the Intelligence Service. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nYou\u0027ll need to show that you\u0027re capable of carrying out tasks that make the Intelligence Service and your mother, the Vizier, look good.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe city-state where the game starts is a dimensional nexus.  Recently a portal has opened up to a small realm which had been lost for a few hundred years. After your brief initial training, you\u0027ll be sent there to assess the situation and hopefully re-establish links to harvest lust.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLust is what powers the city in your home dimension, and it must be collected and transferred back through the dimensional portals.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUpon arrival, you\u0027ll find that you\u0027ve been \"summoned\" that is, a ritual was performed to open the portal to your dimension. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe \"summoner\" used to be a breeder in the society here.  Breeders are kept away from most of society as they know the pleasures of the flesh.  The strict religious establishment maintains control in part by controlling sexual desire.   This breeder managed to escape and sought to learn more about these pleasures.  Traveling the lands, this breeder happened upon an old seer who had knowledge of the times before the current religious regime.  The seer took the breeder with him and introduced a book outlining a ritual to summon a being of lust.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis breeder spent years acquiring the components needed for the ritual and found a suitably hidden location to perform it deep within a cave system.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is unfortunate for the breeder however as soon after the preparations were made, groups of (bandits/goblins/idkwtf yet) found the two entrances to the cave system and are now at war for control of it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLow on supplies, and near delirious from the strain caused by the ritual performance, the breeder is fully dependent on your handling the cave war situation in whatever manner you deem appropriate or viable.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAfter that, there\u0027s the refugee camp, and gaining access to the city, and taking on the religious establishment.  Probably all while building up you cave base and recruiting adherents to your own sex religion if you choose to have them believe you are the new god and liberator.  It gets a little fuzzier this far out :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eGame Play\u003c/h3\u003e\nThe game-play has quite a few elements:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eCombat\u003c/strong\u003e is like Dark Souls.

They have needs. Fulfilling those needs and wants can be achieved in various ways. For example, the NPC:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Requires an item? Sneak in and steal it, Parley your way in and trade for it, Kill someone who has it and take it, Have your skilled recruits make one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Wants someone dead? Fight in and kill them in open combat, Sneak in and stab them in the back, Talk your way in and poison them while blaming it on the cook, Inform the target on them and see what the target has to offer, Make it look like an accident.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Needs to get to safety? Escort them openly, Hide them, Turn them in, Kill them, Recruit them, Negotiate their safety.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n(not yet implemented)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eUnique NPC\u0027s\u003c/strong\u003e - Obviously generic NPC\u0027s are much easier to implement, but they\u0027re boring and you don\u0027t give a shit about any of them. I want each NPC to have the capacity to evoke an emotional reaction. I plan on achieving this in a few ways:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Recruit-able: Any NPC can be recruited. In this way, any NPC may be useful to you and not just some background prop. (not yet implemented)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Jobs/Skills: NPC\u0027s can earn levels in various jobs/skills. They can be assigned to tasks that are related to these jobs/skills. The tasks can be helpful to you and help in building/maintaining your base. As characters increase their skills, they may be able to unlock more specialized jobs/skills. Example jobs: Guard/Solider, Miner, Cartographer, Smith, Cook, Scout, Lumberjack, Raider, Architect, Builder, Farmer, Fisher, Hunter, Some kind of Leadership type role, and Sexual Adherents. (not yet implemented)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Opinions: NPC\u0027s individually form opinions of you based on ~160 descriptors. These opinions will determine how the NPC interacts with you. Interacting with the NPC\u0027s may cause them follow you, fight you, or fuck you. (system basics are implemented on the Under Proxy character, will need a bit more work for all NPC\u0027s)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Personalities: Using the same system as opinions, the NPC\u0027s will have personalities based on the same descriptors. This will also determine how the NPC interacts with you. (not yet implemented)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Names/Visuals/Equipment: It\u0027s hard to care about something if it\u0027s indistinguishable from 100 other somethings. Unique names are fairly easy. Beyond that, I want to be able to recognize individual NPC\u0027s from a distance, simply based on sight. \"Oh hey! Is that Alice over there? Big tits, skinny, long curly hair, likes to wear that red skirt. Is she with Adam? Big, muscular guy, short, blond hair, walks with a limp?\" (Names/Equipment not yet implemented. Many character customization options are currently available as seen in the demo, very extensible)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Sexual Preferences/Fetishes: This is an adult game after all. NPC\u0027s will have have different sexual preferences and fetishes. Things they like in a partner, things they like to watch, things they like to do and have done to them. \"Adam likes to throat fuck chicks with big tits and big dicks while getting a rim-job from chubby girls with pierced nipples.\" (very basics are implemented.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Dialog: The general dialog for NPC\u0027s is going to be a significant undertaking. I\u0027m probably going to want to hire a writer. I also need to give this a lot more thought but I\u0027ve got some of it conceived already. In general I\u0027m thinking I want one giant dialog tree/web. This web will be the framework for almost all possible dialog options. Everything from introductions, to instigating fights, to recruiting and initiating sex, to starting missions/quests. Actual missions/quests will probably be their own, much smaller webs. Options in the webs will be dependent on the NPC personalities and their opinions of you. The actual lines of dialog will be built based on references to an XML dictionary/thesaurus type file. So different characters will use different words to express very similar sentiments:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Thanks. You\u0027ve been very helpful.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Thank you. Your help is much appreciated.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\"You have my thanks. I don\u0027t know what I\u0027d have done.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n\"Hmm. I guess you\u0027re not useless.\"\u003cbr\u003e\n(not yet implemented)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cu\u003eSupport\u003c/u\u003e is more than just money.\u003c/h3\u003eWant to support this project? \u00a0Of course money helps, but more important to me is \u003cstrong\u003efeedback\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0Tell me what you like, and what you really don\u0027t. \u00a0Is there something you encounter that just kills it for you? \u00a0Let me know. \u00a0I don\u0027t want to spend a lot of resources on market research, so I\u0027ll take feedback anywhere I can get it, and focus as much time as possible on development.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso \u003cstrong\u003esharing \u003c/strong\u003eis huge. \u00a0I know that sharing a porn game isn\u0027t something I\u0027d like to do with personal friends and family, but I also know that many folks have separate porn accounts for twitter, reddit, various forums and whatnot. \u00a0Spreading the word in any way you\u0027re comfortable with would be very much appreciated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eContact\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/aephrosi\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://blog.rifix.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/twitter-logo.png\" style=\"width: 86px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/x9v2nYh\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/quT50Id.png\" style=\"width: 63px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:aephrosi@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.flaticon.com/icons/png/128/281/281769.png\" style=\"width: 79px;\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
