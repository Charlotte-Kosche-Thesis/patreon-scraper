    "summary": "I am documenting my new found passion for firearms and female self-defense on YouTube.  Self-reliance and the love of shooting has really hit me.  I am about as far as you can get from being an authority on anything related to firearms but one day that will/can all change. Everyone starts somewhere, and with me that starts right here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am hoping to show women that it is ok to start from scratch.  To inspire other women to have confidence in themselves so that they can protect themselves in ANY situation. Firearms are the great equalizer that allows anyone to take the power away from evil.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMOST IMPORTANTLY I want to show women how supportive and accepting the gun community can be towards people starting from scratch.  I have received overwhelming support and I want women and ALL beginners to know that if they remain humble, they too will be received as well as anyone could ever expect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 With proper training and exposure, together we can inspire others to cast irrational fears aside and take full control over their own well-being and the well-being of their loved ones!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat is my mission statement!  Lol \u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading!"
