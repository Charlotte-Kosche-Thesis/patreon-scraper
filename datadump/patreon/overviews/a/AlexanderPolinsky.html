    "summary": "My name is Alexander Niver Polinsky, I make art, music and performance. I am the founder of Avatarism, a neo-prankster, a practicing Reverend and occasional fire dancer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs any artist can tell you, one of the most wonderful things you could receive is support for your artistic endeavor. \u003cbr\u003eLike a bullet from a love gun aimed at your heart, public support can destroy an artist\u0027s fear. Fear of whether or not you can take the time you need to make a piece of work, fear of how the fantastic recording studio costs can be paid and fear of keeping the heat and power on while you take 10 years to write the book or album that may change the world.....Fear is the mindkiller, you must not fear.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith just a small amount of support each month I can turn my entire focus to my missions; Making beautiful music both on my online streaming shows and in the studio working with producers.Your support means I would be able to prepare for my live shows during the week and create much more original content. As for recording, your support would mean I wouldn\u0027t have to beg for producers to record with me...I will be able to hire and work with better producers and in more quality studios to create the best music of my career resulting in my first real album. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour gift of loving support will help me Finish my book \"Altar Yourself A Guide to Avatarism,\" (a super interactive, fun-inspiring, adult coloring book style self-help guide for people who want to create, or re-create who they are.) This is part of the great work of my life. Avatarism is the oldest philosophy and the simplest way to understand who you are, why you got that way and what can be done about it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf I have a couple thousand dollars a month I will be able to travel to festivals, symposiums, schools, yoga studios, retreats and living rooms around the world and teach Avatarism\u0027s message of good will, self love and radical embodiment\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour generous support also means that I can conceive of and create larger works of art. This is a game changer for me because I long to make music videos, sculptures, costumes and larger pieces of art. What a blessing it would be to to have the means to be able to purchase things recording and performing gear, art making tools like a #3D printer/laser cutter and\u00a0 to create more beautiful things to share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, with your support I can finally have the resources to make things like music videos, costumes and concerts which have always been a dream of mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your support, all these things and more are possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your love, thank you for your time and thank you for supporting me. I cannot tell you how much it means to me. I hope I get to tell you in person and hug you at a show in the near future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eForever endeavor!\u003cbr\u003eAlexander Polinsky\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
