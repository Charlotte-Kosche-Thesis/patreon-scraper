I started to modify it to practice what I was learning in Computer Science Course, but I quickly felt in love with making 3D assets.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3 years later, I am still motivated but now \u003cstrong\u003eI am modding Cities Skylines, CO\u00b4s last wonder !\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3D modelling is really fun, it gives you the opportunity to personalize anything you want. I really enjoy personalizing my game and I would really love to help you making your game more personal as well. \u003cbr\u003eThis is why I have created this account. I would love to hear from you and to \u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003epublish regularly items that you miss in your own game.\u003c/b\u003e\u00a0Of course, I also started many collection already, as you can see in the slides here below. And I have to finish these collections as well. This means that I need more time, and this is why I need your support as Patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking these buildings is very useful for me, because it gives me experience for the job market. Soon, I will start to have enough to make a 3D artist portfolio, and start expecting making something out of this passion. In the slides below you can have a hint of what I did before for the workshop of Cities Skylines, I hope this can give you ideas about what you would like me to build for you ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t34.0-12/12660210_10208425274212010_102066164_n.jpg?oh=5c7f87deb6fd42a7a1f46d8ccb5e5270\u0026amp;oe=56B7D19C\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t34.0-12/12666443_10208425274092007_280942621_n.jpg?oh=707803a34f48280643585752f51a88c9\u0026amp;oe=56B6DAEF\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t34.0-12/12666521_10208425274172009_1406305038_n.jpg?oh=9d561cdef9f0666eaaed8a957c0adf54\u0026amp;oe=56B6CF7E\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t34.0-12/12650732_10208425273892002_1056600486_n.jpg?oh=d35da01f72e46abadd2b9d8c3c032559\u0026amp;oe=56B7D453\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t34.0-12/12674452_10208425274132008_1771871356_n.jpg?oh=79724dd33427eef0556d0ffc6573a51a\u0026amp;oe=56B79E40\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfp1/v/t34.0-12/12660334_10208425273932003_900673052_n.jpg?oh=51d98490931e41596e19249857bbb1ee\u0026amp;oe=56B7A3CE\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-ams3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpt1/v/t34.0-12/12660222_10208425273972004_838698807_n.jpg?oh=43eefc949da230f5e4394d6840993148\u0026amp;oe=56B7A533\"\u003e"

During my free time, I started to mod Cities in Motion of Colossal Order. After a short time, modding became my main hobby and I started to be really passionate by 3D modelling. I can say I owe a lot to Colossal Order, modding their game really helped me to learn 3D creation, programming and design. Sure I would have not been graduated without modifying their game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I do :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, I am doing the last year of a Bachelor of Software development and I want to work in the game industry in the future. Again, Colossal Order released an amazing game, Cities Skylines, and again, it has been so useful for me to mod it. I learn so many new development tool and I really progress in 3D modelling because of their product !\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I want to do :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to start a carrier in the game industry. I would love to become a 3D artist, who knows, perhaps even starting my own business of 3D modelling or Game Development...\u003cbr\u003eBut for this I need to practice, and practice again. One of the best way is to make more buildings for Cities Skylines, but this is very time consuming, and you know what we say about time ;)",
