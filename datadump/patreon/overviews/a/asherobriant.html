    "summary": "I\u0027m just a boy sitting in front of a computer wanting to produce short films and videos for an audience. If I could I would love to spend my time, 24/7, working on film and everything that goes into it. Alas, it digs up a hole in your wallet, bank account, and free time rather quickly! With that being said however, I would much appreciate it if you could help me get back to doing what I do best (and becoming an anti social hermit to work on videos)!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn general, I try to make videos which I genuinely believe will help people in any way I can. Anything from mental health to LGBTQ+ support, and everything in between that I can think of. This is the best way that I know to express myself. Which is why Youtube\u0027s censorship, unmonetization, and discrimination of transgender creators (like myself) is so heartbreaking. This will allow me to make videos that may not fit with the \u003cem\u003e\"ideals\" \u003c/em\u003e(homophobic \u0026amp; bigoted ideals mind you) that the platform values. I want to create for the sake of creating, not for censorship or sticking with the norm when I am not viewed as normal.\u003cbr\u003eTrust me, if you help me at accomplishing this I will not let you down. As a creator I will offer everything that I can to thank you for your appreciation and support with my art. I promise that there will be many goodies in your future if you become a patron!\u003cbr\u003e"

I really don\u0027t mind covering myself in paint or doing strange things for art. In general, my platform is Youtube. However, with the issues youtube right now smaller creators (especially transgender creators such as myself) are being censored, unmonetized, and just straight up cut out of the program. With trying to compete with the discrimination and neglect, Patreon is the only way I make income for videos plain and simple.\u003cbr\u003eYoutube and film making takes longer than anyone expects or even imagines, which is why I appreciate it so much when people support me and my art in any way possible. If you do pledge I promise that I will be a very grateful creator with giving all of you early access to videos, videos that are only open to you guys, updates, taking your opinions on upcoming videos, and plenty of goodies!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much!\u003cbr\u003e",
