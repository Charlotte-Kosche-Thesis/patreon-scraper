I started with the semi autobiographical web comic \"The Real Life Adventures Of Ami-Chan and Vin Diesel Jesus\" and am now working on my continuing comic \"Bounty Haunters\", the story of a young ghost hunter and her bounty hunter ghost partner.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also a veteran of over 130 convention appearances around the United States. I\u0027ve been traveling all over these past 12 years selling art, but also doing my best to spread a love of drawing and painting. I\u0027ve given more demonstrations and speeches than I can count on the subject of learning to draw and create a comic series of your own to countless people young and old. Art education is important to me, and I love to help budding artist wherever I find them however I can.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, here I am on Patreon. Why, you ask? Well, because I would love to have the ability to not only spread art education from the comfort of my own computer, but also to give those who look forward to more of my art the chance to help bring it into being.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to being able to share tips and tutorials and all the other little things that will help others on their path to loving their own creations. I also look forward to sharing all the new and exciting things I learn on the way as I improve in my own art, and yes...an artist is always looking to improve. ^_^\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo THANKS SO MUCH for taking the time to check out my Patreon and I look forward to sharing my work with you and the world!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKisses, yo!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
