     "about": "I am the CEO and Founder of Angelblood Publishing LLC. I am originally from \"The V\" Vallejo California located the Northern California\u0027s Bay Area. I have been developing the world of Angelblood over the past 12 years. Like a lot of you I grew up reading comic books. Completely immersing myself in this email worlds. Wishing I had superpowers lol.\u003cbr\u003eAs I got older I got frustrated with the inability to contribute to my favorite heroes storyline. The publishers consistently changing my favorite character\u0027s origin stories and adding what seemed to be an infinite number of parallel universes. I felt as if they had run out of stories to tell.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe world of Angelblood and Angelblood Publishing LLC address those issues and eliminate those challenges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe game Angelblood itself is a giant sandbox allowing an infinite number of stories to be told. Those stories will be created by our players. Our fanbase. FINALLY!!! Fan boys and girls like myself have an opportunity to tell the stories that WE want to tell and be recognized for their creativity and innovation. The world of Angelblood has a very rich and story driven history inspired by our own history here on earth. Complete with lovers quarrels, politics, religious conflict, bigotry, regional myths and legends you name it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe stories that our fans tell will eventually be digitally published by Angelblood Publishing in Graphic Novel format and immediately be referenced as official \"LORE\" for the world of Angelblood.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe Angelblood RPG is the tool our players use totell their stories. But make no mistake. The driving force behind Angelblood is the imagination and creativity of our community. \u003cbr\u003eWe all have a story to tell.\u003cbr\u003eCome share yours with us.\u003cbr\u003eCHEERS!!!",
