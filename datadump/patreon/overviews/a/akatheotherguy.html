I get it, my voice is either really soothing, or so monotone, that you can\u0027t keep your eyes open. Either way, you being here at all is just awesome, and I appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have some change in your pocket you were going to lose in the couch anyway, and you like to hear more podcasts, or maybe even see some Youtube business, then please feel free to dig that out and help me accomplish that. Your contributions make sure that I can ignore other stuff, and concentrate on nonsense and shenanigans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not asking you to give up your daily cup of coffee, or even that extra quarter for the gumball machine, but every little bit helps. And if you can\u0027t contribute? The fact that you listen to my podcasts and share the love of that podcast to other people is amazing, and helps out a lot. So thank you everyone who listens, shares, and contributes. You are the bees knees."
