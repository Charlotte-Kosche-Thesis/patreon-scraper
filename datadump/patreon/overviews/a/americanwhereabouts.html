Each year, the United Nations estimates 40,000 disappearances around the world go unsolved. Nearly 85,000 unsolved cases pad the FBI\u0027s Missing Person File going back to 1926 (though the number of unsolved cases is much higher and goes back further). Nearly 12,000 unidentified sets human remains have been catalogued by The National Missing and Unidentified Person System. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmerican\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWhereabouts\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, the November 2004 disappearance of a Madison, Wisconsin man becomes a window into the animating forces behind the ever-changing enterprise of human disappearance. Throughout the six-year investigation sparked by Amos Mortier\u0027s disappearance are the echoes of those who went missing before him, of the failed efforts to locate them, and of the reforms their cases brought about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnly in the last 20 years have nations like Australia taken steps to make the whereabouts of missing people a national law enforcement priority. In 2010, 96 nations signed a treaty aimed to prevent state-sponsored disappearance, an idea that emerged in the aftermath of the French Revolution more than 225 years ago. The United States, however, was not among the signatories. Unfortunately, this complacency is mirrored by the laissez-faire attitudes of those tasked with investigating local disappearances. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut as they say: \u003cem\u003eIt\u0027s not a crime to go missing\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eInvestigate Amos Mortier\u0027s disappearance with me and others\u003c/em\u003e...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to \u003cem\u003e\u003cem\u003eAmerican\u003c/em\u003e \u003cem\u003eWhereabouts\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, there will be a website modeled on choose-your-own-adventure stories.

     "description": "The sixth best writing advice I\u0027ve been given is \"write to change the world.\" The most important instrument of change ever developed is the written word because nothing else can give wings to an idea nor would it be possible for ideas to travel as far as they do. This is a first-of-its-kind history on the topic of disappearance and its many forms. For me, $250 allows me to fully immerse myself in this topic for a significant part of each month. For you, it is a belief not only in me, but in this history as one of considerable social importance to us all. In addition to all previous rewards, you will receive 1 of 10 signed copies hot of the press, with an additional copy (unsigned) for you to give as a gift, and a third copy, which I will send to a school, university, or library of your choice as a gift from you. \u00a0",
