    "summary": "So many new developments are happening all the time, from new technologies that seem to be straight out of the pages of a science-fiction novel, to awe-inspiring views of Jupiter or Pluto, but where are the videos? Sure there\u0027s highly technical papers or videos on some of these things somewhere in the vastness of the Internet, or other videos giving a superficial overview of these things, then there\u2019s the \u003cem\u003etabloids...\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo quote Dr. Einstein (from the book The Universe and Dr. Einstein by Lincoln Barnett, 1948):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201c\u003c/strong\u003eAnyone who has ever tried to present a rather abstract scientific subject in a popular manner knows the great difficulties of such an attempt. Either he succeeds in being intelligible by concealing the core of the problem and by offering to the reader only superficial aspects or vague allusions, thus deceiving the reader by arousing in him the deceptive illusion of comprehension; or else he gives an expert account of the problem, but in such a fashion that the untrained reader is unable to follow the exposition and becomes discouraged from reading any further.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If these two categories are omitted from today\u0027s popular scientific literature, surprisingly little remains. But the little that is left is very valuable indeed. It is of great importance that the general public be given an opportunity to experience\u2014consciously and intelligently\u2014the efforts and results of scientific research. It is not sufficient that each result be taken up, elaborated, and applied by a few specialists in the field. Restricting the body of knowledge to a small group deadens the philosophical spirit of a people and leads to spiritual poverty.\u003cstrong\u003e\u201e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ch3\u003eSo let\u0027s provide the middle ground\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy not make videos introducing and explaining these new discoveries and amazing science happening \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eright now\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, and do it without washing away the juicy details and in everyday language to boot?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is exactly why we started AsteronX, because we wanted to see videos on these inspiring happenings ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd apparently so do you, as our first video, explaining a kind of propulsion that can propel a starship faster than the speed of light itself, reached a million views after a little less than a year, and earned 10,000 subscribers all by itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, while money may not actually make the world go \u0027round (Earth\u0027s inertia does that), it does make nearly everything else go \u0027round.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that brings us neatly \u0027round to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile YouTube does indeed supply us with some of the funds we need, it doesn\u0027t quite cover it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how would you like to help? To help fund AsteronX so that we can make more videos, more frequently, and perhaps\u2014who knows\u2014other things as well?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patron you will have access to sneak-peeks of upcoming videos, excerpts of in-progress video scripts, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo how about it? Do you want to fund a science, technology, and space education and research project?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027ll be waiting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
