    "summary": "Welcome to my page! I\u0027m glad you landed here.\u003cbr\u003eI am a multimedia artist and a political cartoonist based in the US. My work of art has inspired the human spirit of thousands of people in dozens of countries. I\u0027m convinced that the power of art can save lives and change the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am globally known as a human rights advocate and a thinker who has collaborated with many well-known, established institutions and artists around the world. I was raised by elderly indigenous women in Africa who could not read a single line of a western book, but they understood the language of Space, Time, Gravity and Daylight. This is one side of my heritage in addition to the formal, western education I was granted. Therefore, I feel that there are many paths to knowledge and approaches to learning ... Art, Media and Social Justice are a few of them.\u003cbr\u003eI use my body as a canvas in creating a contemporary art form. Following political persecution, I found resilience through the art of body painting. I have developed this creative and philosophical approach I call the \"Urban Way\" to transform my world. I bring voice to the voiceless through my work and light to the faces that are unseen. I have performed my body painting in many place around the world. In 2016, I was listed as one of the 100 most influential artists and thinkers in the world by \"Tropics Magazine\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe main purpose of my work is to move people to take action. Through this work, we have brought fresh water to over 20,000 people who never tasted it before, and over made 3000 shipments of medical equipment to rural African villages. This Summer 2017, we launched Radio Taboo, a solar powered community radio serving one million people in ten languages. This radio station is located in the middle of the equatorial forest and is providing music, storytelling, public health and disability\u0027 news by the local people and for the local people. \u00a0This is what the Power of Art can do. In 2011, the United Nations and the French National Assembly invited me to give a speech for the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Convention. In 2015, after the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris, I was one of four artists who spoke to the Human Rights Council on the \u0027Defense of Artistic Expression\u0027, and our resolution was brought to the Security Council, and passed. \u003cbr\u003e I have published over 5000 cartoons, illustrations and graphic novels. My latest cartoon book, \u0027Art Stronger Than Hate\u0027, was published in 2015 by Alamo Bay Press in Austin Texas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My \u201cHumanist\u201d endeavour is above all a proclamation of peace and against intolerance. My soul is of a body that has suffered a lot because the political cartoons in the satirical newspaper in Cameroon. I live outside a world in which I am undesirable, and I\u0092\u2019ve found in my art a refuge where I can protect myself against all aggression. I came into contact with the Human Rights issues at a very early age, and defending the Rights of the oppressed gives me this force of conviction, this feeling of invincibility and the inner peace I seek. I\u0092m like the pages of an open book blown by the winds of liberty. \u003cbr\u003eI use Art to heal myself and others; Because Art really cures and can transform a broken Human Being into a new rebirth soulful individual. In my studio projects, I\u0092 am painting Cartoons on canvas to bring a sense of humor in the drama, with my critical vision of Global Peaceful Society. \u003cbr\u003eI have trained child soldiers how to Love art  like children. I leaded street children how to see live differently and I have accompanied people with disabilities how to create resourceful art project like any individual.\u003cbr\u003eBeing a person who has suffered intolerance and persecution, I would have liked to stop being a victim and live like anyone else. But the past reminds me of whom I am: an outsider. That is why my philosophy of including certain parts of my body in my art \u0096 namely my hands and feet \u0096 to convey my emotions is for me a successful process of resilience. It is an act of protest, the rebellion of a man who cannot return home. This endeavour helps me cope with my current status as a man and a citizen of urban worlds, wandering around the globe.\u003cbr\u003e Music plays an important role in this work, especially when I\u0092m \u00ab performing \u00bb.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAppreciation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIssa Ngandji Nyaphaga",
