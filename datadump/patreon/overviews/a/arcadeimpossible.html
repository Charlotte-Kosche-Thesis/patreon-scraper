    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Gregg and I started this \u0027Arcade Impossible\u0027 thing in July of 2012.\u00a0 It started as a \"Hey, I have these two MAME machines that I\u0027ve had for a while. It\u0027d be crazy to hunt down a dedicated arcade machine and try to recreate the arcade feel from back in the day.\" Because let\u0027s face it, I had no idea it would go this far to the number of machines that are in the basement today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had ambitious goals the first year to release episodes on the 1st of the month and I want to get back to that release schedule. The problem is, I\u0027ve been busy working two jobs and that severely limits my editing time and this obviously causes delays in the release schedule. Staring in 2015 I began paying a local buddy of mine David (Gamer Going Grey) to edit for me and to keep the videos going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love the fact that the arcade is documented fully from start to finish.\u00a0 What you guys have seen so far is snippets of brief pickups with the history of each machine, where it came from, etc, but I do have bigger plans for the content. There will be repair videos, state of the arcade, in-depth reviews and my take of each machine we\u0027ve picked up along with obscure deep dives in to this crazy world of arcade games.\u00a0 There are currently 11 episodes (as of 11/19/15) that need to be edited and released.\u00a0 So I propose that if you want to show your support, feel free to donate an amount per video that will help us get to the goal of monthly regular content again with mid-month content and more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u0027t donate, then no worries. All videos will still be released for free online. This is not a pay wall. All of the funds received will be going to the editor so he can focus on the editing. This intends to ensure regular content when we get to the milestones. \u003cbr\u003e"
