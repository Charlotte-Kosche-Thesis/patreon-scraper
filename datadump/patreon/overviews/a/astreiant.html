    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA Window to Astreiant\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of Astreiant\u2019s stories have never made it into print. I spend a lot of time sketching on these novels, roughing out short scenes that give me a feel for an event, a character, a twist of magic, or the effects of some peculiar conjunction of stars, and this offers a chance to see some of those extra scenes. Sometimes they\u2019re from points of view that I can\u2019t use in the novels \u2014 how the necromancer Istre b\u2019Estorr acquired \u201chis\u201d ghosts, or how junior pointswoman Aliez Sohier defends her boss Rathe when he\u2019s not around \u2014 and sometimes they\u2019re bits of background, like the multiple poisonings of the kings of Chadron, who rarely die natural deaths, or the sea-stories Rathe heard as a boy from the summer-sailor Old Steen, or the play that made Chresta Aconin the most hated man in Astreiant for an entire summer. Sometimes they\u2019re character pieces, bits from characters\u2019 childhood or their careers before the novels begin; sometimes they\u2019re pure domesticity, exploring how daily life works in this city of everyday magics. They\u2019re a window into the larger world of the novels, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m offering here: at least one sketch, a minimum of 500 words, that gives a glimpse of Astreiant and its people that you wouldn\u2019t otherwise see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began this series with my late partner, Lisa A. Barnett, and together we wrote the first two novels, \u003cem\u003ePoint of Hopes\u003c/em\u003e and the Lammy-winning \u003cem\u003ePoint of Dreams\u003c/em\u003e.  After her death, I wasn\u2019t sure I\u2019d be able to go back to this world that we\u2019d build together. Fortunately, Steve Berman of Lethe Press persuaded me that I could at least consider filling in a missing piece of the story \u2014 how pointsman (a sort of policeman) Nicolas Rathe and ex-soldier Philip Eslingen became lovers \u2014 and then encouraged me to go back to the novel that Lisa and I had begun plotting when she got sick. And I discovered, working on those two projects, that I still very much loved the characters, the city, and their world. Originally, we\u2019d talked about doing a novel for each of the fifteen points stations in Astreiant, and I still hope to give each of them at least a story. These sketches are part of that process, and I\u2019m delighted to share them with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy a Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, very simply, any additional income buys me more time to write. Monthly income makes it much easier to pay monthly bills, and means I don\u2019t have to take on as much contract work. And the less contract work I have to do, the more I can write, and the quicker these sketches find their way to novels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been writing science fiction and fantasy since \u2014 well, my first published novel came out from Baen Books in 1984, so it\u2019s been a while. (And that doesn\u2019t count the things I wrote before my first sale.) I\u2019ve won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer, four Lambda Literary Awards, and four Spectrum Awards. I\u2019ve written space opera based on Hermetic and neo-Platonic science (\u003cem\u003eFive-Twelfths of Heaven\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eSilence in Solitude\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eThe Empress of Earth\u003c/em\u003e) and near-future queer cyberpunk (\u003cem\u003eTrouble and Her Friends, The Jazz\u003c/em\u003e). I\u2019ve written alternate histories in which Alexander the Great turned west instead of east (\u003cem\u003eA Choice of Destinies\u003c/em\u003e), and Elizabeth I sent poets Sir Philip Sidney and Christopher Marlowe to save the King of Scots from a plague of witches (\u003cem\u003eThe Armor of Light\u003c/em\u003e), not to mention a secret history, the Order of the Air, in which Jo Graham and I follow a group of veteran flyers, survivors of the First World War, as they face occult threats in the interwar years (\u003cem\u003eLost Things, Steel Blues, Silver Bullet, Wind Raker\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eOath Bound\u003c/em\u003e). I\u2019ve collaborated on two fantasy mystery series, one set in a very different Victorian England (\u003cem\u003eDeath by Silver\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eA Death at the Dionysus Club\u003c/em\u003e), and, of course, the Asteiant novels, where astrology steers most things, including murder (\u003cem\u003ePoint of Hopes, Point of Knives, Point of Dreams\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eFairs\u2019 Point\u003c/em\u003e). In short, I\u2019ve done a lot of very different kinds of stories over the years, and have no intention of cutting back now. In fact, on my drawing board now are an epic fantasy, a serial space opera, and a far-future SF novel about salvage and immortality. (And the idea that arrived unbidden last week, complete with working title: \u003cem\u003eThe Unmurdered Poet\u003c/em\u003e.) But Astreiant remains a fixed star, to use the novels\u2019 terminology, a world of stories I hope to continue writing for many years to come.\u003cbr\u003e"
