Tolkien overnight, but with the support and encouragement of people who genuinely care about my characters and their adventures, challenges and revelations, I know that I can create something beautiful and complete. Something whole, with my heart and soul and mind to shape it into something worthy of your pledges, and your love.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Every week, I intend to reveal another chapter of The Promise to Catherine each Wednesday. on Saturdays, I will post a poem I\u0027ve written at some time or another, or write a new one. When the full story is up, I have another work in progress that I intend to work on alongside the interests of my subscribers, writing it as I go and accepting feedback from my patrons on the characters, developments, stories, and so forth. Maybe one character hasn\u0027t been written on for a few chapters, and you are eager to read more about said person. You can let me know, since, after all, the writer wants to please his audiences. The sequence of the narratives are subject to influence, but this is MY story, so don\u0027t expect to say, \"Oh, you should kill that character off\" or \"That should have happened differently\" and expect me to change it. Tell me what you want and how you feel, and I will see to it that something enjoyable for everyone dedicated to my success and many others the world over can love and enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 That\u0027s all for the time being. Once subscribers start coming around, I\u0027ll make the narration videos. Thank you, whoever you are, for reading.\u003cbr\u003e"

After years of poetry falling by the wayside and novels left unfinished, I am finally taking the initiative to overcome the crushing weight of perfectionist pessimism and procrastination. I owe it to a very special person in my life for the inspiration and encouragement that led me here. I hope that my stories will inspire all of you as well. I want to share the immersive and compelling tales that I\u0027ve kept to myself for far too long, to evoke an emotional experience in the hearts of my readers. And, admittedly, I hope I can use said skills to pay the proverbial and literal bills in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e",
