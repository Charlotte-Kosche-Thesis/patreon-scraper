Until today we track every price change in the App Store in every country. We love what we do and we also love the community that built around it in these years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 we had to remove the iPhone version of AppZapp from the App Store because it suddenly wasn\u0027t compliant with their guidelines anymore. Only the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appzapp-hd-pro-daily-new-apps/id428248004?ign-mpt=uo%3D4\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eiPad version\u003c/a\u003e survived this. For about a year we put all the energy into a new App called AppZapp Notify with a different concept to get back into the Store again. After a lot of trial and error we finally made it and were happy to found a way back.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut a new App meant also to start from scratch with promotions and user base. A lot of people saw in the new App just a lesser version of the old one. So it was hard to grow and overall the numbers went down. Not rapidly but steadily. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now in 2016 we still have a lot of users around that really see and use the potential of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/appzapp-notify-personal-alerts/id845046425\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAppZapp\u003c/a\u003e on a daily basis. The service though gets harder and harder to keep up. We have a lot of basic costs to cover on a monthly basis and that isn\u0027t covered by AppZapp itself anymore. So we have to find a way to keep the lights on. This is why we are here at Patreon. So the people who love and use AppZapp have the possibility to keep it alive. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe wouldn\u0027t ask if it wasn\u0027t serious so we really appreciate any help.\u003cbr\u003eYour AppZapp Team"
