I write primarily contemporary romantic fiction, and recently published my debut novel, \u003cem\u003eBaker\u0027s Dozen\u003c/em\u003e. Writing has been a passion of mine for years, and I am so grateful to all my readers for their support of \u003cem\u003eBaker\u0027s Dozen\u003c/em\u003e, and for their enthusiasm for my upcoming projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe community aspect of the author-reader relationship has always been rewarding for me \u2013 I love to talk to, meet, and interact with the people who enjoy my writing! Your comments, questions, and notes are often the highlight of my day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had people ask how they can help my writing career in any small way, or how they can get my next work off to the presses faster, so I decided to finally bite the bullet and create a Patreon page! I\u0027m hoping my Patreon is a place where I can give back to all of you \u2013 with additional materials from the Baker\u0027s Dozen universe, a sneak peek into what I\u0027m working on next, exclusive content, or unique opportunities to interact with me. (Here\u0027s where I give you a gentle reminder that I write what is probably most accurately classified as \"erotic romance,\" so some of these extras may contain writing that is not suitable for children, prudes, monks, or close relatives that will have a hard time looking me in the eye at Thanksgiving after they\u0027ve read me writing people doin\u0027 the business.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe patronage of supporters like you is what could allow me to free up some of my time to focus on writing the stories you love, rather than having to work extra hours in other pursuits. I want to say a big THANK YOU to anyone who pledges\u2014whether you pledge $1 or $100, I am so grateful for your support, and your belief in my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso please note that since this page is for my original pursuits, while longtime followers of my work may see familiar stories or universes, they may look a bit different when they show up here on Patreon. I hope you like what\u0027s in store!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

Somehow the family\u0027s good sense of pitch skipped her corner of their gene pool.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe spent much of her young and early adult life writing \"for fun,\" and now at thirty years old, has decided to start writing \"for real.\" Her debut novel \u003cem\u003eBaker\u0027s Dozen\u003c/em\u003e was inspired by the city she calls home, and her abiding love of baked goods.",
