    "summary": "Greetings from \u003ca href=\"http://www.anorvellnote.net/\"\u003e A Norvell Note\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing and sharing\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.anorvellnote.net\"\u003e A Norvell Note\u003c/a\u003e (one a week) since the latter part of 1997. I began writing from a desire to put\u00a0words that are \"helpful for building others up according to their needs, that it may benefit those who listen\" (Ephesians 4:29). Or, in this case, those who read. I want people to know the joy and peace that comes from knowing and walking with Jesus through this abundant life that He offers us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNOTE: Actually the title \u003cem\u003eA Norvell Note\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0originated\u00a0in Fall of 1975 when I started writing bulletin articles in my first full-time ministry position with the 7th Street Church of Christ in Columbus, Mississippi. (Thanks, C. Bruce and Maye)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, through the years I have been grateful to the folks at Faithsite.com and Heartlight.org for help in distributing these articles.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you have been with me in these writings from the beginning. You have read them, commented on them, tolerated many misspelled\u00a0words and much incorrect punctuation, and you have shared them with others, and you are still with me. Thank you. Thank you for your faithfulness and your kind and encouraging words. You have no idea what your notes to me mean.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am in a much different place than I was twenty years ago. My life, my family, the world I live in, and the technical ability to share these notes have developed far beyond anything I imagined twenty years ago. My dream and\u00a0desire,\u00a0however, has not changed and\u00a0is as stronger as ever: to help people know Jesus in a real and authentic way. \"Now this is eternal life: that they know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You have sent.\" (John 17:3, NIV)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough Patreon you now have an opportunity to participate with\u00a0me as I continue to write, improve, and expand the personal ministry of writing that I call\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.anorvellnote.net/\"\u003e A Norvell Note\u003c/a\u003e. Any amount is helpful. No amount is too small. These funds will be used to continue writing and distribute \u003cem\u003eA Norvell Note\u003c/em\u003e, expand my writing ministry, editing costs, and at some point office space. A book (paperback, hardback, and ebook) version consisting of selections from twenty years of writing is in the works and should be released in the first half of 2018 (thanks to Grassleaf Publishing).\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThank you again for reading, sharing and encouraging my writings in the past, and I hope in the future. It is my prayer that through these writings more people will be encouraged to experience a life that overflows as a result of knowing Jesus."
