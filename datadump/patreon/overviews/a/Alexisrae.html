I\u0027m Alexis Rae, fantasy and science fiction author and I\u0027m so excited to introduce you to my work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing for as long as I can remember, inspired by the thousands of books that have shaped the very nature of my life. My parents introduced me to amazing stories right from the start and they have continued to inspire me to reach for the stars (both my parents and the stories).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy writing has matured over the years (I\u0027ve come a long way since the stolen sandwich of the fourth-grade class stories I so loved to explore way back then) and I find myself truly excited to present these new, enthralling stories to the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I cannot do this alone. You make what I do worthwhile. Your contributions let me know that I\u0027m bringing something of value to the world, that you truly enjoy the stories that I bring to your attention.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo author wants to sit at home alone, writing for just their pets. We want to share with everyone, to inspire new ideas and thought patterns. We want an audience who craves our stories and asks for more, inspiring us in turn with their own ideas and characters.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I thank you for your attention and for your patronage (or should I say patreonage) and I look forward to continually brining new stories into your life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit my website at: www.alexisraepublishing.com\u00a0"

I\u0027m Alexis Rae and I\u0027m an artist, writer, and teacher. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re in an age of personal growth and understanding, but many people still suffer from diseases like depression. I believe that a shift in perspective is the best remedy\u00a0for issues like this and that shift starts with a change in thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI recently started a project utilizing\u00a0positive statements. I convert the printed words into art which can be displayed around the house to increase the vibration. Each phrase can provide empowerment and, in time, can help you shift your perspective and life in a more positive direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArt is perhaps one of the most powerful sources of healing for the mind and soul. Art guides its viewers toward a state of peace and wonder, allowing them to live in the moment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are most effective when we live in the here and now, it\u0027s where our power lies. Art helps us stay in this state more often, brining out the best in all of us.\u00a0",
