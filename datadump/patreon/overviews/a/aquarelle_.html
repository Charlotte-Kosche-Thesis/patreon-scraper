I am a simple girl from Qu\u00e9bec, Canada who happens to enjoy arts, music and cosplay quite a lot!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a self taught cosplay maker and I sincerely hope you will enjoy my work!. You can see it on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aquarellecosplay/\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/aquarellecosplay/\"\u003eInstagram\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eI have always enjoyed working with my hands and building things and cosplay is helping me fulfil this need of crafting I\u0027ve\u00a0 had for so long! I have been having a LOT of fun since I started cosplaying in December 2016 and I wish to keep having fun for a long, long time. I am also a part-time affiliate streamer. Feel free to check out my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.twitch.tv/aquarellecosplay\"\u003eTwitch\u003c/a\u003e account! I mostly stream cosplay related work but I also stream gaming from time to time!\u00a0\u00a0Cooking and music streams are coming soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOut of cosplay, my main interests are music, food and literature. As some of you may already know, I spent a few years studying Opera and Jazz singing in college. Not only I am a singer, but I also play the guitar and ukulele. Music is and has always been a way for me to express my creativity and passion. Hopefully, I will soon be able to share more of my musical work with you guys! \u003cbr\u003eI am also a trained cook. I have been through culinary and internships in France and my love for the art of the table keeps growing stronger. I have been working in kitchens since my very first job and I am still not tired of it! I will also share this side of me with you here on Patreon! I am already thinking of projects to involve cooking into this big adventure! \u003cbr\u003eMy third love in life is literature. I have been a book worm since I first started to read and am still never leaving home without a book or two (or even more!). If you guys wish, I would be happy to share more about my interest for literary arts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u25cf\u2665\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u2665\u25cf\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been thinking about getting on patreon for a while. I think it is a great platform to share content and also a fantastic way to support artists and help them afford to make their art. As I am trying super hard to be a more serious cosplayer, I thought it was time for me to get more ways to be able to share my work as well as make some money out of it. I also wish to be able to support more artists using this same platform. I hope I will be up to your expectations!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u25cf\u2665\u003cstrong\u003eWhat to expect on Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u2665\u25cf\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of all, I want to share all of the fun I am having doing my craft and art, hopefully, you will enjoy it as well! You can expect to see my new cosplays before the rest of the world! I will also post pictures of my work in progress, as I do not post them on my other social medias, you will be the only ones to actually see how my work looks like before being finished! I will also share \"behind the scene\" pictures of my photo shoot or work on videos or other projects. I will keep adding content as time goes! I want to keep pushing myself further all the time! As we reach the goals, I will be able to add even more content for all of you precious souls who support my work. \u2665\u2665\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u25cf\u2665\u003cstrong\u003eWhere is your money going?\u003c/strong\u003e\u2665\u25cf \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you guys are financially deciding to support me, I believe it is important that you know what is happening with your money. The main use of your pledge money is going to pay for my photo shoots as they get quite expensive. I will also use the money to pay for my cosplay materials (fabrics, thermoplastics, foams, paint...). the other thing I will use the money for is to cover some of my convention fees (convention tickets, hotel, transportation).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI know it seems to be a lot of things but being a cosplayer creates a LOT of expenses as you can see. I just wish to be able to cover some of all of this to make it easier on me!

The rest depends of where you live and postal services. I will unfortunately not provide any tracking numbers as it is quite pricey to add them for general letter delivery.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u25cf\u2665\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I working with?\u003c/strong\u003e\u2665\u25cf\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat could I do without a wonderful and talented photographer to help me on this Patreon journey? As you surely know, cosplayer needs a photographer to immortalise all of our hard work and blood tears. I do have the chance to work with my friend and photographer Marie-France\u00a0for this upcoming Patreon adventure! She will be the main source for all the photo content on my page!
