    "summary": "If you are a regular reader and appreciate what I do here, please support AmazingFoodMadeEasy.com by making a monthly support pledge. It only takes a minute and your collective backing will mean a lot to the future of AmazingFoodMadeEasy.com. I have a lot to say about it, but go check it out first, subscribe, and then come back. I\u2019ll wait.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll signed up? Great! A couple of recent things have set this into motion, but I\u2019ve been thinking about it for awhile. So here\u2019s why I feel this is necessary now, in three interconnected main points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFocus on dedicated readers.\u003c/strong\u003e It is a balancing act deciding how much time to focus on serving regulars while also trying to attract new readers. This is true of anyone who relies on an audience of some kind \u2014 bloggers, artists, writers, and businesses. Even though I feel most sous vide cooks would enjoy this website it\u2019s difficult for me to take time out from writing for the site to reach out to potential new readers. I love being a regular myself and at this point in the site\u2019s evolution, it makes sense to focus mostly on the people who read and love the site. I\u0027d rather spend my time creating great content for you than posting constantly on Instagram, learning SnapChat, and continually chasing new readers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA changed sous vide landscape.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u2019s been 8 years since I published my first cookbook, which was the second sous vide cookbook available and the first for home cooks.  Sous vide has changed a lot since then....heck, it\u0027s changed a lot in the last two years!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the past, there would be a handful of new sous vide books available each year, and through your support during my book launches we would almost always become a top 2 book. That momentum would then be enough to sustain continuing sales through Amazon for several years, attracting new readers while I focused on you regular readers.  However, over just the last two years there were more than 50 new sous vide cookbooks released.  This glut of cookbooks means that new readers were siphoned off from my books. This leads to much, much lower overall sales for my last two books, despite being higher quality, getting better reviews, and having better internal launches with all of you.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmazingFoodMadeEasy.com is now also competing with numerous manufacturers of sous vide machines, many of who subsidize their content through their equipment sales, Kickstarter campaigns, or venture capital money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s no longer enough to create an amazing cookbook and website, market it to your supportive fans, and then get steady income generated through Amazon while you continue to focus on your core readers. Other strategies are now necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDiversification.\u003c/strong\u003e The site currently has two main sources of revenue: cookbook sales via Amazon and affiliate income from Amazon. In an effort to diversify revenue, I\u2019ve tried several things \u2014 cooking products, external sites, iPhone apps and traditionally published books \u2014 and none of them have been able to compete with the cookbook revenue. I\u2019ve thought about trying sponsored posts, Kickstarter campaigns, our own sous vide machine, or partnering exclusively with a large brand, but that all gets away from what I really want to do, which is to create content here, for you, as an independent voice and help you get better at cooking. The latest decrease in cookbook revenue has driven home the need for not putting all my eggs in one basket and I would love for reader support to become a healthy part of the picture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a lot of smaller reasons but in a nutshell: I\u2019m proud of what I\u2019ve built here at AmazingFoodMadeEasy.com over the past 10 years and I\u2019m committed to publishing here regularly and operating independently as long as I am able. Even though the site is a family-run operation, with both my parents actively involved, we\u2019ve never done it alone. You have always been an essential part of this site \u2014 providing me with feedback, counsel, encouragement, pushback, and many great ideas for recipes and posts \u2014 and I\u2019d love your help in taking this next step. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you find value in the content I create and want to ensure I can continue to provide it, please consider providing some support. Whether it is $1 a month or $25 a month, every little bit helps us continue to provide the content you are used to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, thanks for reading and thanks for your support!"
