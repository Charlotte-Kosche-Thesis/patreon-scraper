That\u0027s when my pet business was born, and it quickly took up all my time, as it\u0027s basically like having two full time jobs. (9am-5pm Monday-Friday dog walking; nights and weekends pet sitting.)\u00a0During these last seven years, the pace of my creative output has slowed considerably - stopped, even, for long chunks of time when I\u0027ve been busiest with the business - \u00a0but I have still very sporadically made t-shirt designs (printed via\u00a0\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://teespring.com/stores/art-by-mags\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTeespring\u003c/a\u003e), printed t-shirts\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/6u8Sn0TBVC/?taken-by=mags504\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDIY style in my kitchen\u003c/a\u003e, and made small stencil pop art paintings.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/artbymags/14360323255/in/album-72157600047904196/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"230\" src=\"https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3839/14360323255_40ee51719c.jpg\" width=\"230\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"240\" src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4141/5446600254_b4176c3c4b_n.jpg\" width=\"225\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003ca target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg height=\"240\" src=\"https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5217/5387467183_48e08950e0_n.jpg\" width=\"197\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m interested in learning to work bigger, on larger canvases and wood, and hope to further combine my folk, street, pop and graphic art influences into a more cohesive style. But most of all, I just want to get back to creating more regularly; I want to be making stuff not\u00a0sporadically\u00a0or slowly over long periods of time, but daily/weekly/monthly, consistently.\u00a0\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tI have so many ideas.

It\u0027s kind of like Kickstarter, but instead of one big project I\u0027m trying to fund, I\u0027m asking for monthly help for ongoing, continued work. I want to use Patreon to jumpstart my creative life again, and help me transition from working full time with animals and having no time for art, to working halftime or less so I have more time to make art - and without the immediate pressure to have to sell stuff to make up the difference. Along the way to that goal, you\u0027ll be helping to keep me in art supplies and maybe a few pieces of equipment that would be helpful. \n\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut mostly, I need help buying my time back from my pet schedule so that I don\u0027t have to be away from my studio all day, every day.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m asking for your help. I first joined Patreon in January of 2016 and gave it a year; I had a one year plan to try Patreon as a way to get support while I got back into the creative flow. In January of 2017, I reassessed. I almost quit - I was feeling guilty about not yet producing \"rewards\" to mail out to all my patrons on a regular, monthly basis. But when I really thought about it, I realized I actually HAD achieved my goal - I WAS back in the creative flow. My flow might be intermittent, it might be slow, but I was back to making things regularly and having the seed money every month to buy supplies with and help cover the cost of making things like stickers and tshirts was super helpful. So I decided to stick with it for another year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, here I am in 2018, reassessing again. Once again, I almost quit in the past few months. But now I\u0027m considering switching over to a per-project account - where I\u0027d only get paid when i actually make something that I can then send out to folks - instead of the monthly model. And I might just strip it down to $5 and $10 memberships. I might just focus on stickers as my only physical rewards to send out. I don\u0027t know; I\u0027m still mulling it all over. But I\u0027m still here, slogging along. And I\u0027m so grateful to all of those who\u0027ve been on this journey with me, for however long. Some folks have come and gone, others have been with me since the start, and a few of you are fairly new. I appreciate all of you and your interest and faith in me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo me, Patreon is not just about financial support but also emotional/creative support. I need your input, your interest, your feedback. More than just a way to make money,\u00a0I see Patreon as a really good structure for me, to be held accountable, and to use as motivation to keep me on track on a regular basis. I will report back to you what I\u0027m working on and my process, and hopefully you\u0027ll tell me what you think.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOK, so, what do YOU get out of this?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003e\n\tWell, most of all, you get the satisfaction of knowing you are helping me, an artist, work towards my dreams. You are being a patron of the arts, directly supporting an artist. You are part of my team. And for that, you are getting exclusive access, and some tokens of my appreciation along the way. See the list of rewards down below - everything from blog posts, photo/video sneak peeks into the studio, and giveaways, to stickers, t-shirts and actual art! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThink of it as pre-ordering (for future creative products to be delivered, aka rewards), or as investing. You are investing in art and in the life/career of an artist. If you believe in the power of art and creativity to brighten and change the world, then this is a great way to put your money where your beliefs are.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e(FYI, when you sign up to pledge on Patreon, you are not locked into paying that amount every month for forever. You can cancel or bump up or down in amount every single month - you always have a choice.

I know some of you will wonder, why now? Why crowdfunding?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd my answer is simple. Because the universe is speaking clearly to me and telling me, the time is now. I\u0027ve been doing a LOT of soul searching over the past few years. I\u0027ve been anguishing about what I should be doing with my life, what makes me happy, what makes me feel fulfilled and like I\u0027m contributing to the world, and how to move forward. And all the while, while I\u0027ve been walking dogs all day every day, I\u0027ve been filling notebook upon notebook with sketches, sending emails to myself with concepts and wording, even telling some of you on the phone all my latest big ideas. But in the past six months, something has shifted... it\u0027s all become very URGENT to me, to do this now. Like it\u0027s now or never. Which I think means I\u0027m finally ready to do this. Ready to succeed, or even ready to fail. I just know I have to try. I have to do something.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m asking you to trust me... that I have all these ideas in my head that really need to get out. And that I have the skills to execute them. I just need some help creating the physical time in which to do so.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eIt\u0027s REALLY hard for me to ask for help, especially for money. \u00a0But as someone who has been low-income most of her life, doesn\u0027t have any living family or partner as a backup or bankroll, has no trust fund or savings or even credit cards to rely on, all I have is my own ability to hustle and my tribe of friends and acquaintances, my network, to help me out when I need it. I don\u0027t ask for help very often but I feel I\u0027m at a crossroads in my life right now, and now is a time when I could really use a little boost to get me going in what I think is the right direction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you\u0027ll join me on this adventure!\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThanks for taking the time to read all this!

And in this transitional time, I wouldn\u0027t be totally reliant on selling stuff to make up the difference because YOU would be supporting me! It would give me time to build up my creative business without the pressure of immediate sales.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, I\u0027d love to get even beyond this and eventually transition away from the pet business entirely.
