Fancy meeting you here! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know me, my name is Ais, which I say like Ace (accidentally appropriate, since I\u0027m also ace myself), but apparently lots of people pronounce it like Ice. I mostly like to write but I\u0027m the slowest loris in the writing zoo. I like art as well -- this isn\u0027t to say I\u0027m good at it (in fact, I call it Ais\u0027 Terrible Art), but I do find it to be really fun and oftentimes immensely relaxing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe themes of my work (writing in particular) tend to be LGBTQIA+ in some form, and typically also other things thrown in to try to rework the expected into something with a twist. I get bored writing cliched/stereotype things, although of course sometimes we all fall into that realm. Most of what I write is usually dorkily layered, because I like creating stories where you can always find something new on the second, third, or fourth rereading-- or at least has some element of research involved in the background, if layered doesn\u0027t work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find examples of my writing at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aisylum.com/writing-masterlist/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy writing masterlist on my site\u003c/a\u003e and examples of my art at Ais\u0027 Terrible Art tagged\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aisylum.com/fun/ais-terrible-art/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon my site\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ais-n.tumblr.com/tagged/ais-terrible-art\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etumblr\u003c/a\u003e, and here at Patreon. I mostly started out doing Paint comics (hence the Terrible Art name) and other digital art, but I lately I\u0027ve been more into hand-colored/drawn art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShort version of how this works: there are no tiers here. The minimum pledge for Patreon ($1) gets you everything from me. If you want to pledge higher than that, that\u0027s extremely kind of you and I greatly appreciate it, but you don\u0027t have to. It\u0027s entirely up to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe longer explanation:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve swung by my Patreon before, previously I had the longest intro ever here but I\u0027ve since decided that was a bit too extra even for me, so I\u0027m scaling it back. (You may be saying to yourself, THIS is scaled back? Oh yes, my friend. I am quite the wordy person...) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started Patreon, I originally thought I could promise certain things every month but I overestimated my energy and underestimated my free time. Actually, it may be better to say that I was optimistic about being able to challenge myself to output a lot every month as a way of inspiring myself, but I didn\u0027t know that the months immediately following the start of my Patreon would be filled with depression and a lot of unexpected things happening in my personal life that kind of staggered one after another in a way that have continued to surprise me just as I am getting back on stable ground. Some of the things that happened you can find out about if you search around online and see what\u0027s been going on in my sphere, and some of the things I haven\u0027t talked about publicly for privacy reasons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat meant I had to spend several months saying I was sorry, I couldn\u0027t do all the things I\u0027d promised in this intro section--and in some months, I couldn\u0027t produce anything at all. I feel awful about that because I already had a hard time setting up Patreon in the first place (because it\u0027s difficult for me to assign value for things I create, therefore I feel guity even giving anyone the option), and I hate to disappoint anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u0027m changing this to give a more realistic view of what to expect -- and know that at any given point, I may do way more than I list here. Especially as things calm down for me personally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery month I will post:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSomething creative - this may be art, short writing, a poem, or something else entirely. It may also be many posts like this, or one or two.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eUpdates or messages or just random comments on what\u0027s going on lately\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eWhen possible and appropriate, I will also give previews of things or let you know my status on different things I\u0027m working on\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI may also post:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFun little background things for stories I\u0027m working on (for example, I wrote an article for a newspaper in Incarnations)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShort stories - I\u0027m seriously trying to work on doing smaller stories (5000 words or less) that are disconnected from anything else and/or can be read completely on their own. I really want to challenge myself to doing this but don\u0027t know currently how consistently I will be able to post/write anything.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u00a0Polls or other questions asking for interaction, ideas, etc\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to get back to also posting:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA chapter (or more) of Incarnations every month - this is a high priority for me, but I have it on the \"I want to\" and not \"I will\" list primarily because I\u0027m still trying to decide if it\u0027s better to post unedited chapters on Patreon or edited chapters, and whether posting on Patreon will disallow me from getting it officially published (which is the final goal) - so this is a \"I want to\" until I can figure out those details\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI also have ideas for:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eFun interactive things like some livestreams and/or recording myself drawing things\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI also think it would be fun to hand draw/color some little postcards or something\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eOne of the reasons my scheduled time is so wonky is because I work full time and am a single dog mom of an older rescue dog with separation anxiety. Her separation anxiety used to be severe, and now it\u0027s much more manageable, but I still worry about my little doggy child all the time because I love her so much. I spend a lot of time decompressing from my day during the work week so weekends are usually when I think I\u0027ll get all my creative projects done, but things pop up on the weekends and/or sometimes I just need that time to further decompress, but the lack of extended productivity can be upsetting. Which then means I need more decompression time which makes me even less productive and requires even \u003cem\u003emore \u003c/em\u003edecompression... It ends up being a very delicate balance that can fail if too many things shift unexpectedly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince writing takes up a lot of my mental and emotional energy (but also is something I love doing when I\u0027m balanced), sometimes I can go quite some time where writing just doesn\u0027t happen for me. It makes me feel guilty, and sometimes frustrated and impatient with myself, but it\u0027s the truth. And to suggest otherwise would be a delusion at best and an outright lie at worst.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway that\u0027s the tl;dr on why I want to be able to promise writing every month but to be entirely fair to you I can\u0027t promise that, just in case, but I can at least promise I will definitely be thinking about how to try to get something useful out there, and I\u0027ll be guilty the rest of the time in between. Is that a good thing? Probably not ^^;\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003ePLEASE NOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e Because it\u0027s still hard for me to ask for money and because I\u0027m aware there are people who want to support me but genuinely can\u0027t afford it, it\u0027s pretty likely that many things I do on Patreon WILL be free eventually. Patrons might get first access to something, or might get to help me choose different projects, or other ideas. But if you don\u0027t want to pledge money, most likely many of the things available here on Patreon will eventually become available for everyone else for free. I will also probably ask questions of people at large for prompts or other things at times so I won\u0027t always take input just from Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nLike Jim Sterling, I\u0027m doing this because I don\u0027t want you feeling like you have to spend money to access something. If you pledge, I want you to pledge because you support \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e, as a person or creator. I don\u0027t want you forced into paying for a service; I want you to feel able to willingly support me to make more content without you being tied into a specific amount to access what you\u0027d like to see, and without you feeling forced into maintaining some sort of contract on a long term basis even when it isn\u0027t fiscally responsible for you to continue. I want you to have the chance to have the community interaction you want even if you just pop in here now and then when you can afford it. And I want you to know your voice will be heard regardless of your pledge amount or frequency, and I will definitely value any feedback you have for ideas going forward on what you\u0027d like to see next.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve known me for years you know how important it is to me to try to keep things as free and open as possible. So you may wonder why I\u0027m doing Patreon at all. I am for all the reasons I already said, but also it comes down to this: if Patreon can help me be more prolific and creative, then even if you don\u0027t support me on Patreon, you will still reap some of the benefits. You will have so much more from me and more consistently post-Patreon than you had pre-Patreon. And for everyone who does support me, they get to decide what works best for them in the level of support of that pledge, but they also get to know they are invaluable for me being able to work harder and do more to share.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you pledge money to me, I will SO, SO much appreciate it! Thank you SO MUCH to anyone who does! But I also want you to know who you\u0027re pledging to before you do. I want it to be a fair \"purchase\" for you. If you do pledge any money to me at all out of the extreme kindness of your heart, you should know I tend to ramble, I am shy and awkward about accepting money, I\u0027m honest to a fault, I constantly feel like I need to apologize for not providing good enough content, and I will always doubt that I\u0027m doing the best job I can. At the same time, I love to write, I love to draw, I love to interact with others on things they love and I love, and more than anything, I love communities.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you do pledge to me, I can\u0027t guarantee you will always love everything I do because that\u0027s so subjective, but I \n\u003cem\u003ecan \u003c/em\u003eguarantee I will genuinely appreciate you for everything you\u0027re doing to support me. And I can promise I would love for this to be a community of any sort, so I will definitely look for chances to interact and include your feedback. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI will listen to you, I will value you, I will respect you, and I hope you\u0027ll do the same for me :) I mean, I do that to people for free too, but if you become a Patron you get that plus the chance to support me making more content, and be engaged in helping me decide sometimes on what I should focus on first, or even ideas for what to do for grab bag stories or art.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nRegardless of whether you become a patron now, in the future, or never, I want to thank you for reading this far and showing this much interest in me and what I do. Thank you for your kindness, and all that you do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m wishing you all the very best, and hope you never stop believing in yourself.\u003cbr\u003e"
