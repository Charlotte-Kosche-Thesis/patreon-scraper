Therefore, the end result is usually unrestricted by any specific format or medium. The visual elements are often expressed through a combination of written words, images and found materials, weaved into stories of shared human experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eMy Story\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the winter of 2014 I sold all my possessions, gave up my\nBrooklyn loft and moved to Berlin with nothing more than two small suitcases. I had quit my role as a Senior Art Director in\nNew York City\u2019s lucrative advertising industry. I was on\ntop of my career\u2013 highly in demand, traveling and making good\nmoney. However, the daily hustle of commercial success did not quench the thirst in my\ncreative soul, instead it left me feeling drained and empty. I was yearning for something much deeper and more meaningful.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI took a leap of faith and moved to Germany to start a new career in non-commercial art. Starting over from scratch was rough, finding a new apartment, applying for visa, getting a job and learning a new language all proved rather challenging. Fortunately, with the love and support of friends new and\nold, I was able to overcome one obstacle after another. Since moving here, I have participated in artist residencies, a few exhibitions and eventually settled into a small art studio within an artist collective. In February 2018 I will have my first solo exhibition in Taiwan, my home country.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough all the ups and downs, one thing I know for sure: I could not have arrived at this point without the help and support of other people. For this kindness I am deeply grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWith that said...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWould you like be MY Medici?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo today I am inviting you, if you want, to become a Patron of \u003cem\u003eAtelier Noir,\u003c/em\u003e get some cool\nrewards, and a friendly and fun forum to have discussions with me and other creatives\nthen please, do become a patron today. I thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you have any questions or thoughts, please email them to me at \u003cstrong\u003eblack.wool.artist@gmail.com\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
