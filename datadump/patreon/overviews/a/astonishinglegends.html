    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eHello! We are Scott Philbrook and Forrest Burgess. A few years ago we realized that whenever we got together with friends or pretty much anywhere, we would wind up talking in depth about great mysteries. We both have a passion for them and once we figured out we each had more than a cursory knowledge of the unknown,  we thought that we might have a good idea for a podcast, and\u00a0\u003cem\u003eAstonishing Legends\u003c/em\u003e was born. If you\u0027ve never heard us,\u00a0check out episodes 23 and 24 where we thoroughly cover the infamous\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://audioboom.com/boos/3565786-dyatlov-pass-part-1-of-2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDyatlov Pass Incident\u003c/a\u003e and you\u0027ll find out why our listeners call us the \u0027Click and Clack of esoterica.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.astonishinglegends.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eWe launched in October of 2014, and we couldn\u0027t wait to share the 1000 plus stories we\u0027d collectively saved.\u00a0Since then we\u0027ve had over 38 million downloads and climbed as high as number 22 on the iTunes charts for all podcasts.  Prior to launching we searched for shows that most closely resembled what we wanted to do and to our surprise, we found that there weren\u0027t any, at least not like us. We are both interested in mixed topics, similar to those old TV shows, \u003cem\u003eUnsolved Mysteries\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eand,\u003cem\u003e In Search Of.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eWe wanted to go further than they had though, and we also wanted to lighten the whole genre up. If a guest tells us a giant demon with wings popped out of a bush in their backyard and flew into the woods, nothing can stop us from cracking a few jokes about that. However, we\u0027re not above scaring our listeners when it\u0027s called for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWe\u0027ve set this Patreon page up because what we\u0027re doing is not without its costs and we want to keep doing it. Podcasting itself is still in its infancy, and a lot of folks aren\u0027t even sure you can make a living at it, but 3 years in now, it would appear we might just be able to do that. We\u0027re not trying to get rich, we just want to keep doing the show and we want it to be the only job the two of us have. There are no high-powered networks or radio professionals behind our show. We are the underdog; pulling ourselves up out of the muddy sea of over 500,000 podcasts. With the help of Patrons such as yourself we can bring Astonishing Legends to the masses, and possibly even start to dig out of the financial hole we\u0027ve dug for ourselves.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOur show is not changing, it will stay free! Patreon is not about paying for what you\u0027re currently getting for free, it\u0027s about supporting something you enjoy and making it possible for us to keep doing it.
