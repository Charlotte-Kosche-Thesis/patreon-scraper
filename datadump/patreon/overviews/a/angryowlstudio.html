    "summary": "Thank you for stopping by!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a single mother, a proud geek, and a compulsive maker of things. I adopted the title of \"artist\" fairly recently. It took me 35 years to realize that this is all I\u0027ve ever wanted to be. I spent most of my life thinking that I couldn\u0027t draw, so I never tried to learn (it was a weird mental block), as such, now that I have embraced the artlife, I have a lot of catching up to do. I love every minute of it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate about what I do. A lot of my art is silly, but I believe that silliness is an essential part of life. My motto is \"celebrating the little things,\" and my goal is almost always to create things that make people smile. It seemed like a small thing at first, but I\u0027ve learned over the years that the little things that make us happy are also the things that give us strength when times are rough. Every time I make a connection with someone through art, I become more determined to keep making things I love and send them out into the world for others to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother thing I am committed to is demystifying the art process. I lost so much time thinking that I couldn\u0027t be an artist because it wasn\u0027t easy for me to make the things in my head real. I assumed that I didn\u0027t deserve the title because I was missing something that other artists had. Finally, I realized that even \"real artists\" work hard, make mistakes, and get frustrated. That was when I started teaching myself that I could draw. Now, whenever I get the chance, I teach people this lesson- making mistakes doesn\u0027t mean you are bad at something, it just means you need more practice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs one of my patrons, you will get to see behind the scenes. I\u0027ll be sharing my progress as I fill in the gaps in my skill set, from learning how to draw a pig to learning effective marketing techniques. It has been an interesting road so far, I have no doubt it will continue to be so. And, if you have a fledgling artist in your life (young or old), I hope the ongoing saga of a 40-something exploring the artlife will give you words of wisdom to share with them on their journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks,\u003cbr\u003eSara"
