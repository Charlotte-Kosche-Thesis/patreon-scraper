The title \"Apocalypse Comics\" gives me an excuse to be cryptic; who I am is not as important as what I aim to give \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e. Melissa explains this all in the video, but we\u0027ll go over it here just in case.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal is to offer you - the one time avid follower of pre-INTERNET (real agenda) off the shelf comic books - the perfect distraction: a digital comic book you will actually want to read and follow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: What is Apocalypse Comics?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: It is an anthology - kind of, a slightly familiar saga which will teach as well as entertain. Apocalypse is an ancient Greek word; most people think it has to do with the end of the world. Apocalypse Comics leans more toward the word\u0027s other meaning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36397182;1000x392.jpeg\" style=\"width: 169px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36634336;1000x392.jpeg\" style=\"width: 166px;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36397168;1000x392.jpeg\" style=\"width: 164px;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWay back in 1992 while I was at college, scribblings in moments of boredom resulted in a comic book proposal - the foundation for a \"bullet-time\", \"ground-breaking\", \"mind-bending\" augmentation of what was then \"hot.\" It was naive,\u003cstrong\u003e unprotected\u003c/strong\u003e and before its time. Let\u0027s leave it at that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow after so many years of waiting - hopefully I will be able to tell that original story the way it was supposed to be told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSet all over the world, and in different periods - the work is hilarious, scary \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e serious. It\u0027s part satire, gross parody, and a fantastic completed inimitable original premise. It will be a pleasure to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36604016;1000x561.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: How does Patreon work? What am I pledging?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: For every new comic page, you\u0027re pledging to donate a small amount. And to make it convenient, you\u0027ll be charged once per month - when each new page is complete and published here.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36603855;1000x392.jpeg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere will be discounts on original art works, personalized commissions, and eventually competitions and\u00a0tutorials. We are building an indelible brand step by step. You really ought to gain access to this unique process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInitially the pages will appear once or twice per month until goals become a reality. And you can edit, cap the amount, and manage things as you see fit. Learn more at Patreon\u0027s FAQ.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me as I produce this book page by page and become as excited as I am to see where it takes us all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://carbonmade-media.accelerator.net/36397184;650x255.webp\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh and Thank You once again.
