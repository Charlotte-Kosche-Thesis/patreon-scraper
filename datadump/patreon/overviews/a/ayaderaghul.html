Basically how it works, what you can expect from me, and how excited I am to have you and to have game theory. You do not have to read this in one sitting. You can read as much as you want, then go about your day and come back when you feel like. I intend for this journey to be long and meaningful because I spend my time and energy into it. I hope you do your part of the bargain: enjoy reading it :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThe spirit\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI believe that when you read me this far, there is a part of you calling and something I can answer or \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003edeliver. I would tell the story of game theory, a mathematical discipline, specifically applied to social conflicts. I study game theory in university and I am still doing research on it.

I intend for this Patreon page to be self contained, to be magical and would deliver my promise :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does this page work?\u003c/h3\u003eFrankly, Patreon is a platform for artists (me) to create and to get paid. If you become a patron, you agree to send some money to the creator (me). It can be as low as $1. \u003cstrong\u003eYou can totally say no \u003c/strong\u003eand just browse my free stuff. You can change your mind anytime. You can also set maximum of how much to pay in a month etc. That is briefly how Patreon works.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eTechnically how? You can click the button \"Become a patron\" on top of the page. Or, when you see the right side of the page, there would be a column that you can choose to \"Get $1 rewards\" \"Get $5 rewards\" etc that is the amount you agree to send. I repeat that \u003cstrong\u003eyou can totally say no\u003c/strong\u003e. After you choose, you can pay with credit card or Paypal. I prefer Paypal, it is convenient and safe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI am thinking of charging per creation\u003c/strong\u003e because currently i feel it convenient. It would take about 5 articles on each chapter. And I estimate to have about 5 chapters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you do not become a patron, it would make me happy if you stick around to read the public posts, talk to other patrons, or drop me a line:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEmail: nguyenlinhchi09@gmail.com\u003cbr\u003eFacebook: \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ayaderaghul\"\u003ehttps://www.facebook.com/ayaderaghul\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eTwitter: \u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/Ayaderaghul\"\u003ehttps://twitter.com/Ayaderaghul\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI base in Trento, Italy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePrivacy note \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am super proud and want to share your support \neverywhere to show my gratitude.
