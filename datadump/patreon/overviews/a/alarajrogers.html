    "summary": "So I write stuff. You probably know that if you\u0027re on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I\u0027m focused, when my health is good and my blood pressure\u0027s down and I\u0027m not under crippling financial stress, I can write 2,000 words a day. At my best, I\u0027ve been known to get 20,000 done on a Saturday. But my rate\u0027s been half that in 2014 because none of that stuff has been true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBy supporting me you enable me to write more and faster. It\u0027s that simple.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nBut we all know that warm fuzzy feelings of generosity plus a buck twenty gets you a candy bar, so what\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor anyone who pledges two dollars or more a month, I will be offering temporarily exclusive content. Drafts of stories in progress. Snippets from stories I\u0027m not writing yet, but there are scenes already written in my head, and I\u0027ll put them down in pixels for you. Rants. Headcanons. Reviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is either material that will be released eventually when the story they\u0027re part of gets to that point, or material I intend to release publicly, but you guys get it at least a week before anyone else does. So none of this is permanently exclusive (aside possibly from drafts I retcon and decide not to use), but you get early access.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFive dollars or more a month, and I\u0027ll use your name, handle, persona or OC (your choice) as a cameo in a fic. Plus, three or four times a year, I\u0027ll let my five-dollar-and-higher supporters pick, via vote, which of my projects I\u0027ll work on next. And you get access to outlines as well, so if you want spoilers, you can spoil yourself thoroughly. (Though anything I outline may change as I write it.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTwenty dollars or more a month, and you can hit me up with requests for scenes, ficlets or full stories (we\u0027ll discuss the fine print if it comes to that; my muse won\u0027t let me write every possible story idea.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou write fanfic. Is this actually legal?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile the legality of fanfic itself has always been somewhat questionable, fans have always followed a specific principle: don\u0027t sell fanfic for money. As long as you\u0027re not selling your work, fanfic lives in a grey area not fully covered by the law, but sell it and you immediately do smack into an area specifically forbidden by copyright.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, I\u0027m not selling the fanfic. The fanfic will get written one way or another. I\u0027m selling \u003cem\u003eme.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m selling earlier or greater access to my brain and my writing than other people get.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is why I\u0027ve based my account on monthly support rather than per-project. I may create a second account for solely the original work, and base \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0on per-project, but under a monthly support rate, you\u0027re supporting me and what I do with my time, not paying for the actual work I produce.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou have multiple fandoms, but I only care about the work you do in one specific fandom.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nTough. Like I said, you\u0027re supporting me, not specific projects. You always have the choice to withdraw support because I\u0027m not writing enough in the fandom you like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t want you to write stories of type X.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSee above. You don\u0027t get to pick what I don\u0027t write, though at five dollars a month or more you do get some say in what I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e write. But if I decide to write a silly fluffy romance for a pairing you hate, your objections are not gonna stop me. I write a lot of stuff; you may have better luck next time getting something you want. I do provide a lot of warnings and content advisories, so you can probably avoid reading what you don\u0027t want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027re not writing fast enough!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am human, and I have the same kind of lumpy gray neurons in my cranium that you have in yours. I get tired, I get headaches, I get deadlines at work or things I have to do for my kids. That being said, I don\u0027t owe most people an explanation of why I\u0027m not writing fast enough, but anyone who\u0027s pledged to support my writing... I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0owe you guys explanations. So patrons get to find out what\u0027s causing delays, what i\u0027m working on now, and how quickly it\u0027s getting done, a lot more often than anyone else does. That doesn\u0027t mean I can necessarily write faster because you want me to, but I can tell you why I\u0027m not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you can live with these caveats and this sounds like a good deal to you, then you\u0027re exactly the kind of person who might like to make a pledge. Thanks for being a fan!"

Limitations apply; we\u0027ll discuss if it comes to it, but it boils down to, I won\u0027t write an idea with characters I don\u0027t know, I won\u0027t write an idea I find morally reprehensible, and I won\u0027t write an idea that bores me. My morals when it comes to writing are pretty flexible, and I can work with you to make a boring idea less boring if you want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe word count is a general guideline, not a hard and fast rule. If I decide your idea probably needs 2,000 words and then I end up writing 3,000, I wouldn\u0027t hold the extra against you. But if I end up writing 1,700 because that\u0027s all the idea turns out to need, I\u0027m not going to pad it and I\u0027m not going to give you a credit of 300 words, that\u0027s silly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStories will be publicly posted, with you credited as the commissioner unless you request otherwise.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternately, you can ask me to beta read for you.

As a beta reader, I will do a basic grammar and typo check, and I\u0027ll advise on formatting fixes for greater readability, but my main focus is on whether or not your ideas make sense and could possibly be considered in character.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOr, I can do a reading of up to 3,000 words per month, on my fanfic or anyone else\u0027s.
