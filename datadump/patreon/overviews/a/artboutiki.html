    "summary": "The history of the SLG Art Boutiki is one of a series of pivots and happy accidents. SLG Publishing as a comic book publisher was started on almost a whim, with no idea that it would last more than a year, three decades later SLG still publishes new comics and creators, although not as many as we used to, and has now devoted itself to a new pursuit of running a music and arts space in San Jose, CA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHosting live music, much like publishing comics, was something that came upon us accidentally, just something we did to make a little extra money in unused space. Nine years later, the SLG Art Boutiki is considered to be the best small music venue in the South Bay and perhaps one of the better venues of its size in the entire SF Bay Area. The additional plus o fbeing an all-ages venue with a comic shop in the front makes us perhaps one of the most unique spaces anywhere.\u00a0As it was with comics, we jumped into doing something and found we were actually quite good at it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe publishing company and the music venue have something in common; both are family businesses. Most of the people who work at Art Boutiki are either in my family or in our extended family. What we do is a labor of love and something we feel is needed in our area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a number of expenses on a monthly basis which go along with running a full-time business, be it comics, music venue, art gallery, or what-have-you. So we will be using the money contributed here to help pay rent, utilities and payroll for our small company so that we can continue to invest our time and energy into introducing the world to new talent, be they comic artists, musicians or fine artists.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to funding our publishing activities, getting funding through Patreon will allow us to add additional staff to help run APE, The Alternative Press Expo, in future years."
