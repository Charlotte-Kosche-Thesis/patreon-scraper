Any and all contributions you decide to pledge to me would go towards paying for the successful editing and publication of this novel, which is over 6 years in the making and is yearning to reach a larger audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA.

She has been writing since she was 13, and began writing \u003cem\u003eThe Glass Fortress\u003c/em\u003e after the idea came to her in a dream during 8th grade. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Glass Fortress \u003c/em\u003ereached the front page of \u003cem\u003eInkpop\u003c/em\u003e in 2010 and remained there for months, but unfortunately was never taken before the HarperCollins review board. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome reviews for \u003cem\u003eThe Glass Fortress;\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"This was such a humorous and clever read. I \nreally enjoyed the pacing and the way you introduced your characters. \nThere weren\u0027t too many, but just enough to keep us interested. Prince \nRennit was just hilarious to read about. His moody nature and now his \nfascination with Ink (really great name, by the way) \u003cbr\u003eYou have one of the most unique styles of writing and I would \ntotally love to be in your head right now because you have a GREAT \nimagination. This is picked.\"\u00a0 - \u003c/em\u003eCarrie L McRae\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cem\u003eThis is some of the loveliest storytelling that I\u0027ve come across on \ninkpop.  There\u0027s a certain \u0027zing\u0027 to the narrative that I just loved.  \nThe names are cool.  I love how it has a fairy-tale sort of feel, but \nthen there are modern things thrown in, like department stores and cell \nphones.  The characters actually have character.  Unique personalities \njust pop off the page.  The first chapter does an excellent job of \nintroducing us to the characters and setting, while moving along at a \ngood pace and keeping our interest.  I was highly entertained, and I \ncan\u0027t think of a single critique.  :)  Headed straight for my picks, and\n I wish you the best of luck on inkpop with this story!  Such fun!\u003c/em\u003e\" - WendySue\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"A slightly crazy, happy prince who turns annoying people into statues?  \nI\u2019m hooked already.  And the mention of a cell phone indicated that this\n isn\u2019t your average fantasy.\nAll in all, your characters are beautiful and individual, and I really \nlike your style of writing.  It\u2019s like a quirky fairytale, in the \nabsolute best possible way.\"\u003c/em\u003e - Ichthus~fish\u003cbr\u003e"
