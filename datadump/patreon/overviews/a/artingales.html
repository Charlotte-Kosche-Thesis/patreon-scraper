    "summary": "Hello. I\u0027m April Hoff, founder of Artingales, an art teaching organization with a passion for reaching child victims of abuse through its H.O.P.E. project. \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eH.O.P.E. stands for Healing Our Past Experiences.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e I\u003c/span\u003e started this endeavor after watching kids struggle in school for years as a special education substitute teacher and instructional assistant. I know personally what it\u0027s like to have child abuse negatively impact life, and how art can be the saving grace or a road map to healing. I hold an interdisciplinary fine arts degree with painting/drawing emphasis, and equal credits in printmaking and ceramics. I love kids and find it easy to create bonds with challenged children through humor, relatability, and artistic expression. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eChildren attending a session through the HOPE project \u003cem\u003e(and their families/schools)\u003c/em\u003e pay NOTHING for this service.\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e The profits generated from paying Artingales customers,\u00a0along with generous patrons like you, will support this charitable project.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe help section said keep it short, I\u0027m verbose and trust that some people prefer to read rather than watch videos. You can stop reading now if you want ;)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eHow can you help? \u003cbr\u003eLots of ways.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e You can help by pledging a recurring monthly amount that is comfortable for you, and by spreading the word about what Artingales is doing to assist in the soul damage done to these kids. Another way you can help is to \"teach your children well\" as Crosby, Stills \u0026amp; Nash would say. Teach them it\u0027s okay to say no in certain circumstances, that if something bad happens, it\u0027s not their fault, and that absolutely no matter what, you love them.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eWhy help? \u003cbr\u003eIt takes a village.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Because overcoming abuse is often a long road and comes with far reaching effects, consequences seen well into adulthood. Giving child victims some sense of regained power aids in the healing process. Victims have a very difficult time conforming to cookie-cutter standards in public education. Art is already well-known as an emotionally expressive medium, but helping a child not only synthesize their experiences through art, but also own the profession\u0027s skills if they choose to pursue it as a career later gives fringed children hope of a socially acceptable future where outcasts are embraced. It is not free to practice or teach, however. Supplies are necessary.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eWhat do you get for helping? \u003cbr\u003eGood feeling and art stuff.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Other than the sense of positive impact on society\u0027s future, you get a whole host of rewards at different giving levels listed to the right. What do I mean by positive impact? Well, studies show that child abuse victims can become addicts and/or criminals, and often have adaptive problems, though not all do. Practicing art can offer that needed expressive outlet instead. You also get satisfaction knowing that you\u0027re a part of an organization that spreads the joy of art to everyone, but especially to kids that find it difficult to find joy in anything while they battle the confusion that comes from being a victim. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eWhen does art help? \u003cbr\u003eAlways.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Art can help at any age of introduction. Artingales\u0027 HOPE project focuses on the elementary setting for now, believing that early intervention equates better outcomes sooner. Art classes are readily available to the junior high and high school levels in public education. However, even adults find solace in the process of creation.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhere does the H.O.P.E. project occur? \u003cbr\u003eHere, there, and everywhere.\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e Until we raise enough funds from the profit side of the business and the generosity of Patrons and sponsors, the HOPE project will partner with school districts and facilitators that have behavior classrooms to use their facilities. Ideally we would like to procure a commercial space large enough to give the students a chance to practice art outside of the repetitious classroom environment. That\u0027s our giant long-term goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003eWho else helps? \u003cbr\u003eFriends, family, \u0026amp; fans. \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eMany of my friends donate art supplies they no longer need. One friend is a programmer, he\u0027ll code the PHP for registration because I only know HTML \u0026amp; CSS. Some supporters prefer a one-time donation instead of recurring monthly, they go through the artingales site and use the PayPal \u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003ebutton. My first monetary supporter handed me two $50 bills at the end of the school year, wow did that make me believe I\u0027m on the right track!\u003cbr\u003e"
