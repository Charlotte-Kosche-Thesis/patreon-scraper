I\u0027ve started this Patreon community to share my discoveries with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a patron, you get access to\u00a0\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003ea weekly patrons-only podcast\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(comes with your own unique audio RSS feed), marketing lessons, advice to inspire you to create more, live video streams (coming soon), direct access via a special phone number so you can text me if you need an urgent advice, and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, if what I\u0027ve been sharing over the past decade via my writing, audio/video series, and talks, has positively affected your career, there are few better ways to show your support than by becoming my patron. It\u0027s almost as good as treating me with a vegan meal and a pint of IPA.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing a podcast is \u003cstrong\u003every\u003c/strong\u003e time- and resources-consuming.

Your pledges directly support all that work, so thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://wespin.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Horizontal-Line-Transparent.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHOW MUCH TO PLEDGE\u003c/h4\u003ePledge at least $1/mo and get access to all the goodies I offer on this platform. You can still do more, if you want to: either to show an extra interest and appreciation (I surely will notice), or for additional bonuses, which I\u0027m yet to come up with! Send a text to my SuperPhone number \u003cstrong\u003e+1 (347) 848-1373\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:andrew@wespin.co\"\u003eemail me\u003c/a\u003e so I can learn more about your needs and see what else I could do for you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://wespin.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/Horizontal-Line-Transparent.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHOW TO ASK ME A QUESTION\u003c/h4\u003eUse the Community area on this Patreon profile, PM me, or send an SMS if you have a music marketing or business question.
