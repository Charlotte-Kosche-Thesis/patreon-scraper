Thanks for dropping \nby! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I guess we both have a passion for gay literature and queer fiction. I create short stories and what I call ficto-memoir, like in \u003ca href=\"http://www.ashrehn.com/stories/passionfruit-time/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePassionfruit Time\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.ashrehn.com/stories/19-dornoch-tce/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e19, Dornoch Tce\u003c/a\u003e. A couple of novels are in gestation and, if you become a patron, you\u0027ll get regular access to a taste of what\u0027s to come. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m writing narratives that make our lives more visible,\n inspire and entertain. Okay, I admit, I\u0027m exorcising a few personal demons along the way. That\u0027s kind of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ashrehn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/feast08.pdf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eName of the Game\u003c/a\u003e for me. Current themes encompass tension in gay relationships, polyamory, transgression of all sorts and gendered domesticity with surprises. Occasionally, like \u003ca href=\"http://www.swampwriting.com/?page_id=196\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFallen Heroes\u003c/a\u003e, these stories are even a bit racy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you can see from the \u003ca href=\"http://www.ashrehn.com/stories/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estories on my website\u003c/a\u003e, I\u0027ve already won a few prizes and have a publishing history. Invest in my career as a writer from as little as\u00a0$1 a month and I\u0027ll reward you with a backdoor pass the audience doesn\u0027t usually receive. (Those are US dollars by the way, the green ones. That\u0027s a Patreon thing). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHang on, don\u0027t I know you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m told I look like Adam Levine. Hopefully I\u0027ve chosen photos that don\u0027t give that impression. Not that I\u0027ve got anything against the guy but he\u0027s doing his thing and I\u0027m doing mine. Maybe you\u0027ve already seen my \u003ca href=\"http://www.ashrehn.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewriting website\u003c/a\u003e or know me through my work as a \u003ca href=\"http://www.gaycounsellor.com.au\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egay counsellor\u003c/a\u003e. I also work part time at a university (\u003cem\u003eAdam Levine!\u003c/em\u003e they cry at me across the quad). Hearing other\u0027s stories and being invited into private lives is a privilege and an honour but maybe not the glamorous writing life you might imagine. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you (and me)\u003cem\u003e.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCrafting fiction and preparing novels for publishing takes time. There\u0027s a dusting of motivation required as well, the sparkle that keeps fingers dancing across a keyboard. As a counsellor I\u0027m familiar with the power of acknowledgement to encourage and motivate. Sprinkle me with that stuff!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s in it for you? Contribute just $1 a month\u00a0(Patreon calls this a \u0027pledge\u0027) and I\u0027ll let you into the inner creative sanctum for a start. Aside from exclusive access to what inspires me and a queue-jump on published work, there\u0027s some warm inner-glow to be had. For those who want more, I\u0027ll thank you with an original story once a month to read as you imbibe your preferred poison. If you want to back me all the way, I\u0027ll add autographed copies of my work in print or the equivalent in an e-book as soon as they\u0027re released.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCome on, what are you waiting for?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh yes, did I mention you can remain anonymous if you like? Just choose a profile name and email address that won\u0027t give you away. Easy.\u003cbr\u003e"
