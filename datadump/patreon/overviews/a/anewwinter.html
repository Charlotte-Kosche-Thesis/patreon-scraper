The only evidence is one set of footprints in the snow leading to the murder scene - but nothing leaving it. This is a man\u0027s first hand account of what happened in this brutal winter where over 25 people were murdered or had disappeared.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the UK, this is a horror audiodrama podcast series like no other - and we want to keep it that way. Each season has a weekly episode and we want to continue entertaining our listeners and leading them further into the world of A New Winter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently, we have zero ads, making sure that audiences are completely enveloped in the story - not being advertised to. So you really are making a difference by helping to fund the production costs, software costs, hosting costs and everything else that goes into putting out a podcast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027d like to get enough for better equipment, higher production value and everything we need to keep giving our fans engaging content under the best possible circumstances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre You Doing Rewards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe have decided that instead of offering a bunch of rewards and tiers, we want to just give you a great podcast and focus on that. We want you to fund us because \u003cem\u003eyou want to fund us. \u003c/em\u003eWe don\u0027t want to\u00a0stop people getting content because they can\u0027t afford it, or try and force more money out of you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe tried exclusive episodes before and it didn\u0027t feel quite right. The podcast is free and anyone can access it. So pay as much or as little as you want. Pay nothing if you don\u0027t believe you should. But all we ask is if you please contribute what you think the show is worth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do become a Patron, we\u0027d consider you one of the New Winter Team and now, each week, I\u0027ll be answering questions that Patrons will only be able to submit. It\u0027s not additional content, it\u0027s just a way of us saying thanks and being able to communicate directly with YOU - our hardcore fans.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything Else?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI do have a full-time job and a family, so A New Winter is released in seasons. Therefore, there will be the odd break in-between seasons, but don\u0027t worry you\u0027re not charged for any week without an episode.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Can I Find It?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can subscribe to us on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/a-new-winter/id1065376500?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://soundcloud.com/a-new-winter\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSoundcloud\u003c/a\u003e or any podcast platform of your choice - please leave reviews and tell your friends!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
