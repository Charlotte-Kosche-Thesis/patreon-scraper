I \"hobby\" as an artist and a knitter, but certainly look at my writing much more seriously. Naturally, my \"hobby\" is far more costly than writing, though both can and do interact a lot with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ariescapes.com/sigs/patreon/Patreon-artist.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eHi! I am Andrea, I like to paint watercolor and acrylic paintings. I have dabbled in watercolor for many years, inspired by the colors and creations of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/StephanieLaw/\"\u003e Stephanie Law\u003c/a\u003e. Acrylic as a medium is quite new, and the images of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.design-seeds.com/\"\u003e Design Seeds\u003c/a\u003e, friends photography and even yarn colorways have inspired many different pieces! I am also a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/birdwhisperer.project/\"\u003eBird Whisperer Project\u003c/a\u003e member.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ariescapes.com/sigs/patreon/Patreon-knitter.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI am also a Knitter and have been for 10 years now. I love lacework and shawls the most, but have a few sweaters and things up in my closet. I have three published designs on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.ravelry.com/designers/ariescapes\"\u003eRavelry\u003c/a\u003e, but also have a small line of Stitch markers and Row Counter bracelets on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/Ariescapes?ref=profile_shopname\"\u003eEtsy Page\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ariescapes.com/sigs/patreon/Patreon-Writer.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the core, I have and always will be a Writer. My writing started in post-by-post Roleplay, but it has certainly evolved a lot over the past years. Creating more and more original worlds,\u00a0lore, and Characters that have grown from the myths and mythos of the worlds. And with the help of Patreon, perhaps it will help be able to leave my \"day-job\" and focus not just on my \"hobby\" but also on the one thing I crave to create the most.\u00a0... A book. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNaturally, the writing aspect on Patreon is going to be the highest tier levels, but it allows for an open Beta/Alpha readership and access to some very private notations and lore that I won\u0027t be sharing anywhere else. (dun dun dun..)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me write my books by supporting me. Every little penny that is funneled through patron helps me cover the various costs of ALL my work, with the goals of \"Showing my art at Conventions. Selling Prints. Selling Shawls and other beautiful knitted things.\" But mostly, \"A peace of Mind to write and share stories that I feel are important in the world.\" Because everyone has a voice, and while creating beautiful things is \"fun\", I strongly believe they are very important regarless of their medium."
