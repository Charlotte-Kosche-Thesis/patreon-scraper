That\u0027s what it\u0027s all about really - you\u0027re investing in the quality of my channel as it grows, and I hope to add more milestones and give more back in the future. \u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eAll patrons gain access to my monthly update video on Vimeo.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease don\u0027t pledge anything you can\u0027t really afford.\u003c/strong\u003e \u00a0I\u0027d be embarrassed if I thought anyone was paying money they could ill-afford to watch my videos. \u00a0This is really about quality of life for those who can afford to pay for it, and all of us get to reap the benefits of their generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJim Parker (Adored)"
