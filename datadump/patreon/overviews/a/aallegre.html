    "summary": "My ultimate goal with my animal-centric art and extensive knowledge of animal bio-mechanics gained from firsthand experience is to eliminate the need for live animals in film. Animals kept for films are essentially working animals and while animal rights have come a long way in the last few decades, there is still far to go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy intermediate goal is to create believable computer-generated animals that move properly and look real. This is an objective that can only be achieved through a knowledge of animals and observation, and there is no shortcut or programming algorithm that has yet achieved this goal. I also find it incredibly important to represent misunderstood animals in a relatable way, most readily evidenced in my work with \"pit bulls.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese goals marry my lifelong passion for animal welfare and my artistic abilities in a unique way that I believe will make a real difference in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your interest in my work and I hope that together, we can make the world a better (and more beautiful) place for all living things.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

The costs are aimed at companies, but there are many individuals out there, like me, making their own way and trying to make it affordably.\u00a0",
