I\u0027m glad to have you here!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a \u003ca href=\"http://alexandriamaxwellwrites.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewriter\u003c/a\u003e, and the dream is to be able to write full-time. I have a lot of works in progress, and little time to devote to my creations. So, that\u0027s how I ended up here. Looking for a way to make writing pay the bills. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my favorite writers, like Dickens, published their work in serial form before publishing their works in book form. That is basically how I see my page--a place to publish serialized bits of my work to pay the bills and work towards publishing full-length novels in a physical book form. So, I have a few samples of my work posted here for you to view, but in order to read more, you have to subscribe. That was how I, as a writer, could feel I was giving a service for the money you are giving me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s why my page runs on a monthly basis, instead of a thing by thing basis. Think of this as subscribing to an eZine, because that is essentially how this will be run. And thank you, again, for taking the time to support me. I really do appreciate it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
