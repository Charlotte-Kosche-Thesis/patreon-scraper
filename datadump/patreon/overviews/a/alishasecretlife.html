    "summary": "\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Hi. And, Thank You for considering me of interest. I\u2019m on the road in Europe for the first time; luckily\nwith an experienced traveler who happens to be my friend. As someone who loves\nto write in expression of my life, ideas of who I truly am, seem more like\nghosts than ever.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0As a child from Arizona who was trapped in an extreme\nreligious, violent, and busy household, I wished for nothing more than to\ndisappear into a daily life that would be vastly different than my own. It is a\nstrange thrill for me to see that I successfully grew into a woman\u2019s body, and\nhave escaped into an unknown that my younger self would be proud to see.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0During the last five days in Venice, Italy, I have\nacknowledged one dozen \u201cstarting thoughts\u201d come into my mind.  I\u2019ve been able to fend these thoughts and desires to share\u2026 until now. Especially, since I originally thought that I would start this\nproject on February 6.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0We have just left Venice, Italy, and are aboard a train to\nVienna, Austria. It is February 15, and the sun is setting behind us. Looking\nacross through the window to the left, I see the Italian Alps; whose snowcapped\nmountaintops are reflecting a pink-orange sun. Out the window to my right,\ngrapeless vines stand waiting for warmer weather.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0This Patreon page is non-traditional; a reflection of my own\npersona. Right away, you can become involved with me directly, while enjoying\nsome unique forms of selfish fun that you do not have to share with anyone else\n(unless you want to).\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0While traveling in this new dimension, I feel that there are\none hundred ways and more that I could share with you. What I know is that\nwhile I travel, I want to have some fun with you... and am inviting you to\nsubscribe to my multi-media experiment, for as little as $1.99. Will you help\nme to \u2018stay sharp\u2019 while I travel? All you need to do is take a little risk and\nhave a little curiosity, or allow me to fill a business need that you may have.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Simply scroll through the goals and projects that I have\ncreated for myself, and find what you think looks fun me to do. Donate to that\nproject, and I will show you what I can do! Or, you can choose to hire me to\nfulfill one of my more traditional business roles.\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Where am I located?
