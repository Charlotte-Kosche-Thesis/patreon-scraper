Sometimes we get lucky, and get hosted to events by major brands, but other times we don\u0027t, and sometimes we prefer not to be hosted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than set up some lofty goal we won\u0027t ever reach, our Patreon has been re-structured to set achievable goals, so you know \u003cem\u003eexactly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0what your support will help us achieve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goals might seem like odd amounts; Patreon charges in USD, so we\u0027ve adjusted accordingly."
