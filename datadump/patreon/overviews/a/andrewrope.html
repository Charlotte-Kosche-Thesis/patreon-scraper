    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eHello there!\u003c/h2\u003e     My name is Andrei but you might know me by my artist name Andrew Rope. I am a 21 year old singer/songwriter/producer from Romania and music has always been a important part of my life.      I started singing when I was in the 4th grade or so but I couldn\u0027t sing in front of people so I used to sing in the shower. No one knew, no one could have imagined until one day at my 4th grade festivity, I started singing a song in front of everyone from my class, including their parents and everyone was shocked. Even my mother. No one believed her when she said she didn\u0027t know I could sing and from there on I sang a song at each school festivity but it wasn\u0027t always pleasant as my voice was kind of high pitched and kids were picking up on me at school for that.     Fast forward some years, went to high-school and started a band with some friends and since the high-school 9th grade festive celebration was on the way, we decided to audition for it with a song from Jason Mraz called \"I won\u0027t give up\". As we started singing, the teacher stopped us and said, and here I quote:  \u003cblockquote\u003e\u201cI could slit my wrists open on this song. It\u2019s not suitable for this celebration. Can you guys sing a happier song?\u201d\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cpre\u003e     Since that was the only song we prepared for the audition we refused to learn any other song but those words stuck with me for a while. I can\u0027t blame the teacher for what she said or the way she said it. It was a sad song. And I actually want to thank her because had she not said that, I wouldn\u0027t have found out just how big the struggles will be. Of course, this wasn\u0027t going to be the only case in which someone would make fun of the type of music I sing, but it opened a door for me and it made me realize I shouldn\u0027t care that much.     As the years passed, things got a little brighter. I started having gigs in my hometown and around town and people were actually showing up. The band got disbanded after a while and it was a on and off game with remaking it or not. But, as a solo artist, things were going great. I was posting covers on Youtube, composed my first song, collaborated with different local artists in projects, but it felt like something wasn\u0027t right. I felt as if I had hit a ceiling and I can\u0027t really surpass the \"local artist\" condition so I moved to Bucharest, the capital of Romania.     In Bucharest I started my studies as an Audio Engineer at SAE Institute Bucharest, a place with a great potential for creative projects, a place that made me feel like home and last but not least, the place in which I was born as an artist. One day, after very much thinking, I asked my colleagues what stage name I should adopt because I really had no idea. \u003c/pre\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e \u201cYou should call yourself Andrew Rope!\u201d\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u0026lt;figure\u0026gt;\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fotp3-3.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/26169049_1080362402105965_6675324461927760913_n.jpg?oh=1c7f9ee3e07b2fe0bff7727ccfbf0b51\u0026amp;oe=5ADE40CA\" style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eRecording session at SAE Institute Bucharest\u003cpre\u003e  At first, I didn\u0027t really know what to say but I stuck with it because even if I couldn\u0027t find a good story for it from the beginning, I found one in time. I tend to tie myself and my soul up to people and I tie them up to time by making their stories into songs. I think this is the best explanation for it. Also, I owe this name to someone that has taught me everything I know, my teacher, Cristi Dobrica.      That was just a part of my story, a resume if you may, and I really hope to continue the story with you guys by my side. \u003c/pre\u003e\u003ch3\u003eThank you for your time and I hope that this makes you stick around\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u0026lt;/figure\u0026gt;"
