There\u2019s a playfulness and a pleasure and a natural attraction that is present in my best work relationships.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen one day I fell in love - and fell hard - in one of these relationships. A male colleague, he and I produced numerous wonderful things together. Every part of my creative being was put to use: my art, my writing, my intuitive capacity, my knowledge, my intellect. It was a terrifically productive period, but it was also an incredibly confusing and challenging time for my marriage and my own heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, I couldn\u2019t separate out my own heart and its desires from the work we were doing together. And I didn\u2019t want to. Such is the nature of the heart. It has its own gravity, and it will pull you where it wants you to go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat creative relationship ended. My marriage survived. I\u2019ll tell that story later.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut - what \u003cem\u003ewas\u003c/em\u003e that? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the years that followed, you could say I became a scholar of desire and an explorer of creative intimacy. Those explorations included a Buddhist inquiry retreat in which I asked to use the question, \u201cwhat is desire?\u201d (being good Buddhists, their response was \u201chow about, \u2018what is love\u2019 instead?\u201d); a delicious and empowering training with the late Deborah Taj Anapol (author of Polyamory in the 21st Century); and a personal inquiry into Divine Eros following the work of Karen Johnson and A.H. Almaas, authors of The Power of Divine Eros. Maybe I\u2019ll share some of those stories as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://alisonfornes.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/creativeintimacy.jpg?w=712\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut knowing what I know now, I look back on all of my work relationships and see that the creative erotic has been present all along.\u003c/strong\u003e Regardless of gender or sexual orientation, it has shown up. And sometimes, it hasn\u2019t shown up. Guess which relationships I like best and produce the best work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not interested in just writing my own stories. What I most want is to hear other people\u2019s stories. I want to understand what\u2019s happening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see, I believe that we don\u2019t understand creative eros at all, and that\u2019s largely because of the culture we have been in for the past...well, I don\u2019t know how long. I haven\u2019t done that research yet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my personal experience, when eros has shown up, my immediate association was with romantic relationship, because apparently I\u2019m still working from some puritan paradigm that pairs the erotic with marriage, and work with productivity dedicated to the Lord. Or the Shakers, who were incredibly creative - and who actively sublimated their sexual lives into their work. Perhaps I\u2019ll tell more of that story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s more: I have come to see that eros doesn\u2019t care about my orientation. For all appearances, I am a cis-hetero-female, yet the same sexual charge lives in the creative space I have with other women. AND, I have noticed that there \u003cem\u003eis\u003c/em\u003e a space. To what degree does that unspoken sexual charge create discomfort or challenge our notions of sexual orientation? I want to find out because I would love to expand well beyond that boundary.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd, finally, there are times when the erotic charge has not been present. Why? And how does that affect the work that gets produced?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://alisonfornes.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/whattalkingbout.jpg?w=712\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019ve read this far, perhaps you, too, are interested in this subject.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSO, here\u2019s my offer and my ask: I am ready to turn myself over to this project. To launch this rocket, I am saying yes to the opportunity to enter into a three-month winter retreat and begin this exploration in earnest. \u003c/strong\u003eI will be interviewing people, conducting research -\u00a0including, for those of you who know my main work in systemic constellations, using my systems sensing superpowers to explore the \"Knowing Field\" of this subject - all to develop a body of work about creative intimacy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become one of my Patreon Supporters, you\u0027ll become one of my creative intimates! You\u0027ll get access to exclusive patron-only posts and videos, and you\u0027ll keep my creative juices flowing - because, really, that\u0027s what drives me. Plus, you\u0027ll receive advanced or patron-only invitations to retreats and workshops that I will be creating around this subject because in-person energy sharing is my favorite form of creative intimacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSO join me in this puppy pile of giddy joy and serious creative work!\u00a0AND THANK YOU for being the spark that lights this fire!\u00a0(And know that when I get all turned on like this, I start mixing metaphors.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s my fantasy: I would love to get 100 supporters by December 1. This will allow me to enter my winter retreat knowing you, my supporters and loves, are out there eagerly waiting for more to be revealed about the fire of eros in creative relationships.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
