    "summary": "Hey everyone! I\u0027\u0027m Dan, but you probably know me as Anriku over on Youtube and various other social media outlets. I started making videos in late 2012 as a way to share my thoughts with other anime fans because my friends lost interest in the hobby. My channel has evolved overtime, though. It started as strictly anime reviews, but now includes reviews, discussions, and reactions for various topic such as anime, RWBY, and gaming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy channel isn\u0027t the only thing that has evolved! My reasons for creating videos has changed as well. I want to bring entertaining content to my fans and viewers, but also want to enjoy the creation process. That isn\u0027t all, though. Recently, one of my subscribers reached out to me and explained how my content helped them through a rough time period. They were on the edge and my content brought them back. I\u0027m not going to name the individual of course, but this really touched me. \u003cstrong\u003eThis moment opened my eyes and I realized if I can help even one person through my content then it is all worth it.\u003c/strong\u003e With that being said, Youtube\u0027s constant issues with ad revenue makes it difficult for me to maintain the schedule I want to keep alongside work, college, and time with my girlfriend. I want to continue bringing entertaining content that you all enjoy and doing it daily/weekly, but its becoming more difficult. If you\u0027re reading this then I want to thank you for taking the time to do so, and for supporting my channel, but I\u0027d also like to ask you to consider becoming a backer on my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNone of this is mandatory, but it is greatly appreciated and will ease the difficulty that has been created over the last few years by Youtube\u0027s many issues.\u003c/strong\u003e Of course, if you can\u0027t become a backer I totally understand, and appreciate the support you do give to the channel such as liking, comment, sharing, etc on the videos I upload.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you for all of the support and I hope to continue improving the quality of my content!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"
