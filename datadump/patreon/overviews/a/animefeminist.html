The more positive responses suggested that a space for feminist analysis of anime, manga and other Japanese pop culture was long overdue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe launched on 11th October 2016 with no community, name recognition or reputation, and raised \u003ca href=\"https://www.animefeminist.com/update-two-months-anifem/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e$750 in pledges in just two months\u003c/a\u003e, so it seems those commenters were right! A year later we\u0027d settled into a solid foundation with a smaller, stronger team working hard to cultivate regular, varied content representing a range of perspectives.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does the Patreon money go?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur highest priority is to pay people fairly for their time, energy, and expertise. We have said from the start that our aim was to offer fair pay to every single person who works for AniFem, and in under 2.5 months we exceeded the $800 in pledges which allowed us to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.animefeminist.com/update-anifem-will-pay-all-writers-in-2017/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003epay all contributing writers from 1st January 2017\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have gradually increased the number of people who are paid, including staff writers, editors and administrators - we continue to be proud that we have made this our priority, but we need much more income to be able to cover costs like hosting, design work, in-person events, and so on. AniFem could be much more than just a blog - if we can fund it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo funding source is completely uncomplicated, but crowdfunding is the closest you can get to it. Being paid only by those who appreciate our content means we can tailor our content and its promotion to what our readers want, not what is most likely to drive traffic to our site or lead to clicks away from it. It also makes it easier to avoid conflicts of interest and retain a completely independent, critical voice.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a slower route to financial sustainability, but we firmly believe this is the right path for our feminist organization. Our patrons constantly delight and surprise us with their generosity and goodwill, and we never lose sight of our gratitude towards them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support AniFem?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cI value paying people fairly for their time, energy and expertise.\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou see how poorly writers and artists are treated and paid, and want to support projects like AniFem which has built paying all staff fairly into the business model. \u0027Exposure\u0027 doesn\u0027t pay rent, and feminist exposure can come with a particularly high price.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u201cI\u2019d\nwatch more anime if I didn\u2019t have to sift through all 40+ premieres to figure\nout whether the protagonist falls face-first into a girl\u2019s breasts.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou want anime reviews\nto reliably warn you when a show contains sexual assault, fanservice,\nhomophobia etc., and also when it contains potentially great representations of\nwomen, queer or non-binary characters in particular.
