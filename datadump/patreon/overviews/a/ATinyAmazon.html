    "summary": "Can a 30-something start over? Hi, I\u0027m Gillian, and I am the main writer and part owner of Cos Couture. I\u0027ve devoted years to traveling the country, attending comic cons, and featuring artists in the geek community. I\u0027ve written over 500 cosplay articles and am an admin and one of the founding members of Themyscira. Themy is a safe place for women in the geeky community, myself included. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have recently decided to divorce my husband of 10 years and am leaving with almost no possessions. At 37 I find myself about to live alone in a neighborhood I don\u0027t know. After decades of being a good wife, sister, and daughter I woke up one day and couldn\u0027t even choose a favorite color. I don\u0027t have a favorite food. Everything I do, I do for someone else and I am scared to be on my own.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am about to live alone, for the first time ever, and I\u0027m leaving without a stick of furniture. I can barely change a light bulb and I am off like a herd of turtles into the world of DIY. I have to find a job, build a home, and discover what it is to be an Amazon of Themyscira. I\u0027ll be sharing exclusive photos, videos, and writing about my journey here. I\u0027m also a bit of a derp, so expect some \"moments\" when I encounter my first bug or wield my first xacto knife. My personal style is geeky, natural science buff, with a sprinkle of mad scientist, a dash of steampunk, and a pinch of southern belle. My very first step was choosing my favorite color for myself, which was harder than you think when you\u0027re used to decorating for a spouse. RED. My favorite color is red, and I will be an Amazon one day soon. If Wonder Woman can do it, so can I. I\u0027d love for you to follow me here!\u00a0"
