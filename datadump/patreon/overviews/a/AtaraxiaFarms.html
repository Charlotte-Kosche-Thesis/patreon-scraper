    "summary": "Hi! My name is Farrah. For a long time now I have been thinking in the back of my mind that I would like to do something with the particular skill set that I have that could help others. Well, that desire has led me here, to Patreon. I\u0027m really doing this for three reasons. \n 1) a way to bring in a little money to help support my children. (Who knew kids were so expensive?!) 2) a way to help people reconnect with the food system and put the power of self reliance, at least in a small way, back in their hands. \u00a03) a way to help the very environments we live and work in and, in turn, help maybe start my own small ripple that would help heal the planet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDon\u0027t be discouraged if you don\u0027t have a bunch land or only rent an apartment! We live in the \"city.\" I say \"city\" because at best we could describe it as the classic small town, seven red-lights in all. Hehehe. But the permaculture principles I want to share can be scaled down to anyone\u0027s life. From edible landscaping to vertical gardening back to container gardening, the smallest space can be incorporated. Follow along with me as I share my gardens with you. We\u0027ll talk about plants, insects, soil ecology and much, much more. Let me help you reduce your dependency on the big agricultural system we have developed in this country, and put a little more control back in your hands. Whether you\u0027re just looking for a few fresh seasonal veggies or a little more security in your food supply, let me help you on your way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, most of the Patreon pages charge per video or creation. I plan to post new content quite a bit though, so this would add up fast. To solve that, I\u0027ve set mine up as a per month subscription. I hope you can find a tier that fits you and join in the community I want to help build!\u003cbr\u003e"
