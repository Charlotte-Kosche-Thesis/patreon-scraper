I\u0027ve met a few applications that helped doing that, but every time I wanted to add a cross-platform game, I had to go to a settings panel of sorts and set something up. I didn\u0027t like that at all, I didn\u0027t want to be constantly there at the settings window.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThat drove me to create AsperiaSuite, so I would have a cross-platform fullscreen game library that I never had to configure again.\nThe same principle goes for the RSS Newsfeed module.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/NZCz1wQ.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOur main objective is to make the gaming and news-reading experiences more enjoyable, and AsperiaSuite aims to achieve that by generating a cross-platform launcher of the games you have in your computer and displaying the RSS Feeds of your favorite news websites in a fullscreen hub, making it easy to keep up with what\u0027s happening everywhere.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAsperiaSuite\u0027s features:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Gamehall module: generate a cross-platform fullscreen game launcher that you only need to configure once. The launcher automatically generates the icons of the games, based on their official covers, and the icons are customizable as well. The only thing you have to do is put your game shortcuts in a folder and you\u0027ll be good to go. AsperiaSuite will scan that folder from now on, and whenever you add a new game shortcut, there will be a launcher icon ready for it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Newsfeed module: generate a sidebar on your desktop to keep track of 3 news websites, blogs and even subreddits by just inserting their RSS Feed URL into AsperiaSuite\u0027s settings. There\u0027s also a very neat fullscreen hub that displays up to 5 RSS Feeds.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Ad-free experience. The only ad you\u0027ll ever see is a \"support us on patreon\" ad which isn\u0027t present in the patrons-only version.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/YYdwRi0.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPatrons will have early access to beta releases. A PSP or Wii emulator specialized screen that\u0027s coming out only in Version 4? You might have access to it and test how it works way before that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons also will have access to an exclusive version of AsperiaSuite, without any AS social media buttons (our Facebook fanpage, Youtube channel..), as well as the \"support us on Patreon\" button because well, you just did.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy investing even more in our project, you\u0027ll be able to rearrange our development priorities if you want, which can be very interesting if you want a specific feature to be out in the next release.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to advertise your news website or blog, there\u0027s room for that for dedicated patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAsperiaSuite is being developed by a college student, which makes it kinda hard to focus on design and development at the same time that living costs and college papers are being taken care of. Patreon is a platform that comes in handy, giving you the opportunity to motivate the work and creation of AsperiaSuite\u0027s updates, so a stream of content can be deployed without stumbling on worries of bills that have to be paid and other stressful stuff that needs to be taken care of.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe development roadmap is established (and believing in transparency, we\u0027re sharing it with you guys!), with all features that are to be deployed in the upcoming releases, and we invite you to join us into building this future, with more cool and enjoyable experiences for everyone.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAsperiaSuite\u0027s releases are going to free. All of them. We also are going to make demonstration videos of how cool the future features are going to look and how they are going to work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s Rainmeter?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAsperiaSuite is being developed using Rainmeter, which is a tool that allows you to develop, set up and configure customizable displays on your desktop. If you\u0027re into design and customization, I really recommend you to check it out.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThank you for reading this. I hope you enjoy AsperiaSuite!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/zqZMgpZ.jpg\" style=\"width: 79px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
