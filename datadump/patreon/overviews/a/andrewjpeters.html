    "summary": "Thanks so much for visiting my page!! I\u0027m a writer with a big dream: to do what I love and make a sustainable income from it, and you can help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs far back as I can remember, I\u0027ve had an abundant imagination. That came, in part, from being a somewhat shy and lonely kid who escaped the boredom by creating stories I would have liked to read. I journaled. I wrote short stories and full-length novels and even stage plays and musicals all the way back in elementary school. No, I won\u0027t be sharing those, though I wish I had held on to them for my own personal enjoyment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wrote all through high school and college, taking creative writing courses as much as I could, but practicality got the better of me. I chose a very different career that offered the stability of a full-time job. While that led me on a journey I can\u0027t say I regret, I\u0027ll never know what might have been if I had pushed my writing dinghy into the rollicking sea and followed my greatest passion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo now I\u0027m an adult who returned to writing a little later in life. I\u0027m steadily publishing my work in journals and at small presses, and sometimes through self-publishing platforms. My novels have won the Silver Falchion award (\u003ca href=\"https://www.boldstrokesbooks.com/books/the-city-of-seven-gods-by-andrew-j-peters-1880-b\"\u003eThe City of Seven Gods\u003c/a\u003e) and been chosen as readers\u0027 choice finalists (\u003ca href=\"http://vagabondagepress.com/blog/38-2/fantasy/urban-fantasy/werecat-the-trilogy/\"\u003eWerecat\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eseries). I write fantasy for fans of gay fiction primarily, and if you dig authors like Gregory Maguire, David Gemmell, and Guy Gavriel Kay, you might dig my work, especially if you wish that retold fantasy and epic fantasy had more gay characters.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://andrewjpeterswrites.com/\"\u003eHere\u0027s my website\u003c/a\u003e where you can see all of my titles and my blog.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m presently working on a short story collection themed around classical mythology and folklore, and that\u0027s what I\u0027ll primarily be sharing here as I work toward my goal of getting it professionally published. I tend to have my hand in a variety of pots, and as I work on the follow up to \u003cem\u003eThe City of Seven Gods\u003c/em\u003e, I\u0027m looking forward to releasing chapters of that too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon gives me the opportunity to do what I love, share that with readers, and earn some financial supporters so I can take things to the next level. My goal is not so much to earn enough to cover my living expenses (though that would be nice). I\u0027d love to have the funds to cover the costs that go along with being a writer like editing, book design, and marketing (the big one).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy the way, there are a lot of ways you can support me without spending a buck. You can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://andrewjpeterswrites.us7.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=2bd08ba15b97f87bce43131e4\u0026amp;id=50b331d226\"\u003ejoin my mailing list\u003c/a\u003e to get in on freebies, discounts, and early releases.
