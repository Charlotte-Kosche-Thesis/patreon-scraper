I am running to be a pro-active advocate for positive principled messaging, voter outreach, growing party membership, candidate training and helping give membership a greater voice in the LNC by providing a listening ear to independent caucus groups. I know that these steps will empower the LP to elect even more Libertarians, reduce the size and scope of Government and free communities to innovate and thrive to survive in today\u2019s ever changing world.     \u003cbr\u003eI am a 3 time Libertarian Party Candidate, former officer in the Manhattan and Brooklyn Libertarian Party, I have provided graphic design, social media and marketing assistance to party chapters and candidates. I have created Libertarian Media through videos and podcasts, and I am currently serving as the Policy Director of the Larry Sharpe for Governor of New York Campaign.     \u003cbr\u003eThe Libertarian message is one that has changed my life and has empowered me to take the reigns of my life to produce value for myself and others. The principles of liberty are ones that I am dedicated to share to everyone, especially those struggling to find their way forward who may not see that the answer has been inside them all along. \u003cbr\u003e    \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goals as Vice Chair Would Be:   \u003c/strong\u003e  \u003cbr\u003e- Create a \u201cCaucus Congress\u201d, an informal monthy conference call for caucus groups to discuss LNC proposals and party business to create feedback for LNC representatives to use in their deliberations.
