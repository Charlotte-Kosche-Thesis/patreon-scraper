    "summary": "Hi, and welcome to my Patreon page. This is where all my stuff that doesn\u0027t get published elsewhere will go from now on. But that doesn\u0027t mean what you read here are leftovers! Rather, it\u0027s a repository for all the ideas I have that haven\u0027t found a suitable paying home over the years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of you will best know me for my music journalism. However, I have varied interests in natural history and the environment, politics, media matters, personal/life stories and more. So I\u0027m not going to make too many guarantees about what you\u0027re going to get here - that may vary, and not everything I write will be in your area of interest.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne thing I can guarantee, though, is that if any of these things are of particular interest, they\u0027ll all get a run at various stages, depending on what\u0027s firing me up from week to week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll writers are looking for new ways to earn their keep in this transitional era for journalism. Personally, I\u0027m not of the view that citizen journalism can fill the gaps caused by the decline of major mastheads by ourselves. On the other hand, the loss of specialist writers across those mastheads mean new opportunities for people like me to connect with readers like you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance for reading and for supporting my work. A very small amount of money from you goes a long way in my world: for example, if I can encourage a couple of hundred people to contribute as little as $20 a year, that makes a $4000 difference to my annual earnings.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting can be an incredibly isolating endeavour, and sometimes a harsh one. It\u0027s not always great for one\u0027s well-being, especially when an unfortunate part of the game is routinely getting torn to shreds in comment sections. But this is different; if you\u0027re paying me anything, I\u0027m guessing it\u0027s because you actually enjoy and value what I do. And that means a great deal to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to you all and hope to give you as much reading pleasure as I can, on whatever topic it might be."
