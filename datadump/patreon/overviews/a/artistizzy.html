You may know me as one of the two animators for the YouTube series\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/yomama\"\u003eYo Mama\u003c/a\u003e, as a regular on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/RebelTaxi99\"\u003eRebelTaxi\u0027s Pizza Party Podcast\u003c/a\u003e or that kinda cool trans girl who draws things on Twitter/Instagram/Tumblr as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ArtistIzzy\"\u003e@ArtistIzzy\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m creating this Patreon for those who enjoy my work and want to support me and my endeavors. As you may know, freelancing can be tough and scary as you don\u0027t know when you may get an amazing gig or go months without any work. And as embarrassing as it is to admit it now, I went to an Art Institute and now have had a crippling\u00a0amount of students loans that have handicapped two of my goals in life: a) moving to California and b) the process of transitioning. It hasn\u0027t stopped me, just slowed down my path!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be as transparent as possible that the money made from this Patreon will be used to either help with transgender-related endeavors\u00a0(medical cost, health insurance, hiring a voice training coach, hair removal etc) and be helping me strengthen\u00a0my brand/workspace (convention travel, supplies, computer parts, etc). This isn\u0027t a rainy day fund, and I will do my best to document where the money comes and goes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also setting up this account as a tip-jar. Typically you are supposed to entice people to donate even more by more by giving them more rewards based on how much they donate. I am going to go against the grain because I am not interested in buying people\u0027s support. I am going to give \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eALL DIGITAL\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e rewards at the one dollar tier. You may choose to donate more if you would like, but that is because you want to support me and not because you want shiny rewards. However, I will offer two tiers that are physical for a higher donation because the cost to produce/send; namely a Monthly-Postcard and Monthly Sketchcards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eCurrent Projects\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharacter Design Challenge\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://78.media.tumblr.com/dc0f7de2b710172eac7b6a1e3c76185a/tumblr_p2ck2rUTVM1x0m4syo1_1280.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018, My goal is that every week I redesign my avatar of myself to look like she is an in-universe character. It\u0027s a cute and fun challenge to practice my character design skills and pick up on some cool techniques for my future work.
