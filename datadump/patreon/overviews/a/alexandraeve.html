I have been modeling for about 2 years, and have decided in the last 8 months to turn it into a career as well as a passion.\u003cbr\u003eModeling has helped me to accept myself as I am, by allowing myself to realize the beauty I really possess through someone else\u0027s eyes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a kid and teenager, I was terrible awkward, one of those kids that has no friends, and I hated myself. I never would have thought to grow up to be a model, like I have. I want to continue pursuing modeling as a career as well as a passion, not only for myself but to inspire others such as my own nieces to grow up and do anything they want, even if it isn\u0027t something they can picture ever happening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhile I love modeling and will continue to do it no matter what, it is an expensive passion to have. While I get paid for some shoots, I also collaborate with artists I admire without asking for my rates, simply because I want their work in my portfolio.\u003cbr\u003eBy donating to my Patreon, you are helping me to make sure I have gas in my car for travel, helping me pay my rent, helping me feed myself and my dog, and also helping me find new wardrobe for each shoot I attend.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have reached my $70 a month goal to purchase an instax camera! I am now able to take and send out my own exclusive signed polaroids for $8/month pledges.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy goal now is to reach $200 a month, simply because that is my budget to travel to shoots on a monthly basis. If I reach $200 a month, it will enable me to completely fund my own projects, which means more exclusive monthly content for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy pledging ANY amount, you are helping my dream and reality of being a full-time model.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://68.media.tumblr.com/020fe005e11f9a4cc4657961a04c6368/tumblr_ogwwbkaOS71vfb34go1_1280.jpg\"\u003e"
