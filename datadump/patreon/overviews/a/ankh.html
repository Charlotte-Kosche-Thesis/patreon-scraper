The project features an\nethnically diverse cast of gritty, relatable characters framed in a charged societal/socio-political\ncriticism centering on the socially relevant themes of ever-escalating\ngovernment control, corruption of market and law, classicism, and the\nimportance of perspective. Ankh is modeled as an adult, cynical comedy and action\nAmerican-style comic with the intention of a long-term narrative. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI, KMLessard, personally thank you for considering\nsupporting Ankh! This story is our passion. For Alister and I, our writing is\neverything. It is the foundation on which our friendship and later, our\nrelationship, was built upon. Authenticity of expression and quality are our top\npriority in this project, it is for this reason we have opted to self publish\nand release here, through Patreon, to preserve the work from unwanted editing or\ncensorship by the industry.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWith your subscription to our bi-monthly online issue,\nyou\u0027re supporting an independent, home grown comic. Our team is only two-man\nstrong, including myself. Alister and I write, draw, and publish from our modest\nliving space in sunny Florida. We\u2019re looking to expand our team soon but our current\nequipment and comfortable synergy has left us only at disadvantage of work time\nand funding.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour kind contributions will help us better our quality of\nproduct, hire on the staff necessary to maximize our productivity through\nco-artistry, 3d modeling, web design, and future animation, keep our equipment\nefficient and up to date, create the opportunity to offer our fan base print graphic\nnovels, art prints, and other merchandise, and allow us the financial freedom\nto commit even more of our time to this project.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so much for taking the time to consider our\nproject!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nxoxo\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eKMLessard\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
