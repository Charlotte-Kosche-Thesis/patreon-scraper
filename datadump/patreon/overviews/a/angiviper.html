    "summary": "Cosplay has changed\n my life in more ways than I knew possible. It gave me the push to lose \nweight when I was 200 pounds, knocked me out of my comfort zone and \nintroduced me to the best friends I\u0027ve ever had and gave me the \nmotivation to get a job when I was unemployed and struggling to survive.\u00a0 Cosplay has had such a large impact on me that I can\u0027t imagine my life without it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI went to college for film \u0026amp; \nphotography, practiced as a makeup artist, performed in theater and \nfilm, taught myself to sew and have been singing since I could talk.  \nCosplay is an outlet for me to expand my talents and bring everything \nthat interests me together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince I rejoined the cosplay community \u00a0in 2012, I\u0027ve made two fan films and over 50 costumes as well as \nperformed in multiple cosplay musicals, created costumes for others and opened my own costume commission business. \n I enjoy challenging myself and seeing how far I can push my skills to \ncreate new and exciting content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve learned a lot since I started cosplaying, and now it\u0027s time for the next step.\u00a0 I\u0027d like to start building more complex designs and working more with props, armor and wigs.  \nI\u0027d also love to film more tutorials, convention coverage and other \nbehind the scenes but all I have access to is my iPad and an old DVtape \nvideo camera, neither of which take very high quality video and \nimporting and editing them takes days, if not weeks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking for support \nfrom Patrons because so much of my monthly budget goes into purchasing \nfabric and wigs for costumes that everything else is forced to fall to the \nside.  With your help I can potentially invest in a new video camera \nwhich would make filming vlogs and other videos possible, start working with more advanced materials like Worbla and \nmaybe even travel outside of SoCal for conventions!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour help allows me to give back to you in ways I\u0027ve always wanted but can\u0027t due to my financial and time limitations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe thing I \nlove most about cosplay is the community.  I love interacting with \npeople and sharing ideas with fellow creators.  I\n don\u0027t know how to tell you all how much you mean to me but every\n encouraging word helps push me forward to becoming a better cosplayer \nand performer.  Any support that you can offer means the world to me so \ndon\u0027t feel bad if you can\u0027t give much.  Believe me, I \nunderstand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo everyone who does decide to become a Patron; thank \nyou.  From the bottom of my heart.  Being able to bring some\n of my favorite characters to life through cosplay, photo and video makes me \nhappier than anything in the world ever has and I feel so blessed to \nhave people who want to help me grow and see more of my work.  To \neveryone who can\u0027t; remember a Like on my Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Twitch or Youtube is a way to show\n me your support and every new follower means more motivation for me to \nkeep being my best."
