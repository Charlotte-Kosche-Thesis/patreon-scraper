Creating media that breathes life back into the Rights of Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Press. Our community of revolutionaries, activists and thinkers can build this energy together, one piece at a time.

I am creating to develop the world\u0027s largest worker owned media company. Built with like minds, from across the globe, creating to shift the narratives in global media and bringing back the value in Freedom of Press.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuilding a worker owned company from within our own communities; where we seek to be the change in media, entrepreneurship and supply chain, will set the new tone for a look into \"capitalism\" and content creation. In order to bring this to life, we need to pull together creative from our community locally and digitally around the World. Bringing life to stories that need to be heard without a mainstream media narrative and without a shareholders bottom dollar narrative.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tI have been politically influenced my entire life, coming from a home where stocks were discussed frequently and riding the tractor was a daily, I was taught to take my voice to my politicians at a very early age. Currently, I am on the board for the Southern California chapter of Americans for Democratic Action; in addition to, volunteering my photography and writing to various grassroots organizations and candidates in and around Los Angeles.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003eFor 10 years, I sought out photographers as mentors and learned in fashion studios...the fundamentals of retouching, lighting and editorial structures. Infront of the camera and behind the camera, I found my passion for creating imagery that speaks. Using that outlet for political messaging has a big influence on national dialogue as our communities continue to see beauty as something to seek after. I look forward to creating more conceptual editorials based around our social issue messaging; editorials that pair with the investigative stories about our communities and eliminate the stereotypical character blueprint the current fashion paradigm has held \"beauty\" in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBuilding community will make the shift towards creating in depth content, a lot easier than if we keep taking on mainstream media individually and selling our ideas to their studios. Take a look at the Rewards to the right for details on how you can join the community and be a part of the planning of our worker owned media company. The goals provide for building a team, establishing a registered company and opening up for feedback from the community. Look forward to hearing from individuals, organizations, and even local businesses in regards to the issues facing our neighborhoods.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/17596232_272832459826022_4574323363480076288_n.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\tLAX Day 2 - #NoBanNoWall\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003ch1\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\t\tThe criminal justice, the climate justice, the refugee justice...The echo chamber is already limiting our thoughts in real life and then factor in the social media algorithms and then the monopolized media narratives, and it is no wonder that a majority of the world is following the same pop culture news and the same militarized propaganda war themes.

Citizens journalists have popped up across the country as our generation fends for genuine facts in media and news.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$5,000 will begin the process towards registering our worker owned enterprise, and starts the process of building out ground teams across the nation for reporting on investigative stories and rapid response coverage. Like the bank shut downs in Seattle this week. Let\u0027s invest in the companies we wish to see in the World, and divest from the mindless info-tainment news filling our timelines.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time to make progress from our live stream, run and gun shooting. Shane Smith at Vice stepped it up years ago, it\u0027s time we as fellow content creators starting pushing a new narrative too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAttracting the eyes glued on mainstream media, is no easy feat. I know there is no competing with mainstream media without polished content, and with your Patreonage we can establish a strong team that expresses our narrative of change and provides the World with content that represents the true stories. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

Too often we dedicate our days to big media companies, and are left with no energy to build out our own companies...one which can compete with these current monopolies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$10,000 contributed monthly will pave the way towards expanding the team of a worker owned production company, one \"of\u003cem\u003e\u00a0the people, for the people, by the people.\" \u003c/em\u003eOne that shifts the paradigm and builds a new foundation for filmmaking and Freedom of Press. The business plan and market research are already complete, once funds are available, we will expand the team, finalize business registrations, secure an office/production space. Building out a solid team of writers, documentarians, filmmakers and activists from across the World.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI see a team which can create short and feature length stories that value Freedom of Press and are compassionate to their community\u0027s stories. Can you help us reach this vision of bringing informational dialogue into the media channels? Together we can be the change we wish to see media world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
