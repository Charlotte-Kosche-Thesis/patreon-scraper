     "about": "Born into a family of artists, genetics of course can only provide the impulse to gravitate towards the arts and as I have discovered over time, following one discipline often provides you with a template to follow other mediums and opportunities for free expression.\u00a0It\u0027s the art of life whether\u00a0we be a creator or receptive patron alike. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first love was music and the energy spent learning songs quickly became the energy I used to begin writing and recording my own material. As early as\u00a01971 I embarked on creating a series of\u00a0albums of my songs and music, to date I probably have created over 50 albums of songs and instrumentals.\u00a0Surely only a small percentage of this material has seen the light of day beyond a few digital sales and some earlier work released on vinyl. (and re-issued recently: Islands in Space and 10,001 Dreams).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI come to Patreon in the hopes that there may be patrons out there on the www who wouldn\u0027t mind hearing and supporting my music and song writing efforts and more particularly some of the exciting applications I am bringing together for the new virtual reality market. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I am developing music \u0027experientials\u0027\u00a0for the Oculus Rift through my Dreamscaping Series, (http://www.Dreamscaping.com) a series of landscaped dream-worlds full of imaginative locations to wander and\u00a0listen to music. One could say they are intended as great\u00a0\u0027get away\u0027 after a hard day\u0027s work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe creation of my\u00a0music has always been an\u00a0ongoing active meditation, the lyrics often reflecting particular insights into the nature of my perceptions at\u00a0their most fundamental point of view in my awareness. Virtual reality (VR) provides that familiar first-person, halo deck-like perspective so natural to the human psyche. As a visual artist I have always\u00a0seen the\u00a0relationship between\u00a0the vision of my\u00a0art and the music I create,\u00a0however virtual reality now provides\u00a0us with\u00a0a magnificent\u00a0platform to share our imaginations with\u00a0an ever more sophisticated\u00a0audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo all\u00a0likely patrons out there. the best way you can support me is through your purchase of my final products either my music\u00a0found here http://www.paulmarcano.com/music/samples/TheJukeboxSampler.html or if you have an Oculus RIft, then through the purchase of my music\u00a0experientials\u00a0at http://\u003ca href=\"http://www.dreamscaping.com\"\u003ewww.Dreamscaping.com\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI of course am more than open to other support through Patreon\u0027s excellent Patron platform as detailed in my project goals.\u00a0At each level of support you will receive regular special rates and first-time access to developing and finished projects that I am working on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your interest.\u003cbr\u003ePaul R.

Since the desktop VR \u0027art and music\u0027 audience is pretty small at this point, there is still a mobile audience that is larger so I am frequently releasing 360 degree music videos for those\u00a0 who have taken an initial interest in mobile VR through the Oculus Gear VR/Samsung phone and other viewers out there like Google Cardboard. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese mobile devices represent at least a taste of the VR experience and have sold exponentially more than actual power-house-based VR Desktop Systems which are only now starting to come down in price. That is very encouraging to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny patrons of this ongoing goal will be generously rewarded with digital downloads, previews and updates on my projects. For now, I am focusing on building on my Dreamscaping Series. I do from time to time meet in virtual places like BigScreen, VRChat and vTime to talk to people and often provide free copies to interested users to gain their feedback and help hone my skills as a developer. If you are a patron with an Oculus Rift I would welcome an opportunity to chat in person through these exciting social platforms.

The series began with Where Spheres Touch VR and featured an album of songs written from experiences in social VR worlds, circa 2007. With the re-issue of my vinyl album Islands in Space I created an accompanying Oculus Rift app called Islands in Space VR and so with the followup release of 10001 Dreams on Vinyl I would really like to accompany that album with a 10001 Dreams themed virtual world too! $15/month from 100 patrons would certainly help move this project along.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatron will receive at the $15/month level, a digital download of this double album plus a copy of the finished Oculus Rift application as well as an album a month from my archives. \u003cbr\u003e",
