As soon as Kris and I complied with the idea of coercive education, our daughters began to say and show that they were learners, not classroom fixtures. A couple years shy of a decade later, and the four of us are now fully living as unschoolers wanting to play active roles in the larger movement for more respect and trust-based relationships between adults and young people. Today, I write and speak to unschool, and to share the ways Self-Directed Education supports decolonizing, deschooling, \u0026amp; getting free. Among the primary ways I do this work is by sharing the voices and narratives of unschooling and deschooling happening among Black folks and Brown folks all over the world. I also help to organize self-directed work, research, communities, and efforts as a founding Board Member of The Alliance for Self-Directed Education. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe podcast is why I joined Patreon to ask for monthly pledges of small amounts to help me sustain this community-building project.
