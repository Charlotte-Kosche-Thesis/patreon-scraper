    "summary": "At the beginning of 2015 I publicly made a promise to write and publish something every day for a whole year.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can check out every post so far here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://facebook.com/andycharringtonwriting\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efacebook.com/andycharringtonwriting\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was looking for a voice that I could resonate with. I was struggling to understand myself and wanted to read that I wasn\u0027t crazy. I struggled to find that voice. So instead, I decided to be that voice. Because if I was looking for that voice, perhaps someone else was.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat year is nearly up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I want to carry on. \u003cstrong\u003eI want to do another year\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I\u0027m going to. I\u0027ve decided. My adventure isn\u0027t done yet. And maybe neither is yours?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, life has led me to a point where I need money. I hate admitting that. But it\u0027s true. In order to make certain, significant changes - like going bankrupt which will enable me to start again financially - I need to be able to pay my way. I\u0027m thinking of it as a \"grown up hippy\" sort of thing. Admitting what I need, whilst also trying to maintain some integrity and creativity. And perhaps I can write all of that down and pass it on to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegularly receiving any amount of money would change my life. It would mean that I can pay my rent every month, take my children swimming and buy enough food to not be a skinny hippy anymore.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut it would also give me the space to write for you. Every day. I want to write even more than the daily musings and subsequent books I already write. I want to write a \"proper\" book. There\u0027s a few titles I\u0027m working with. \"\u003cem\u003eLove and other stuff\u003c/em\u003e\" - An anthology of life and love. \"\u003cem\u003eLion Hawk\u003c/em\u003e\" - A fictional story of two creatures most unlikely to fall in love and the conversations that happen between them and the rest of the world around them. As well as a bunch of others. But whilst I spend each day worrying about how to make enough money from my struggling web development business (\u003ca href=\"http://andycharrington.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eandycharrington.co.uk\u003c/a\u003e), I have no space to do what I think I was meant to do. Which is write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps, I\u0027ll also be able to start a few of the creative projects I have wanted to start for a while. All based around enriching our lives. And if I do, \u003cstrong\u003eALL\u003c/strong\u003e of you will get special treatment. Discount codes, exclusive content, I don\u0027t know. Let\u0027s see huh?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut this isn\u0027t about charity. You have to get something out of this too. So for those of you that have the ability to pledge more (see the rewards section) I will send you a \u003cstrong\u003esigned copy of every book\u003c/strong\u003e that you pledged for the duration of writing (3 months).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, really importantly, I want to hear from you. I want to know what you think. I want to talk. So let\u0027s. If you have a question, if something doesn\u0027t add up or you want to know something I haven\u0027t shared, please get in touch and ask. I\u0027ll be honest!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s it. If I don\u0027t ask, I don\u0027t get. So I\u0027m asking. Really nicely. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndy\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eps. For those of you that are kind enough to pledge to me before 2016, I promise to produce the remaining three books and send one of them to you for free (or one book for every $30 worth of pledge). I am going to produce them anyway, you\u0027ll just feel better about it. :)\u003c/em\u003e"
