I\u0027m a YouTuber, freelance editor, and YA author. I\u0027m also a smol chronically ill Latinx person figuring myself out through pretending to be other people having their own fantastic\u2014and terrible\u2014adventures on the page for a couple hours a day, as one does.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove all else I\u0027m a storyteller. And I love helping other people tell stories, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4287/35431327720_87f625598d_b.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eThat\u0027s a great question with a complicated\u2014but also not-so-complicated\u2014answer. For years I\u0027ve been helping others write novels of their own through my blog, Writability, and YouTube channel, bookishpixie. I love doing it and I\u0027ve met so many wonderful people along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a long time I\u0027d mostly lived at home when I wasn\u0027t living on a campus somewhere, which kept my expenses relatively low. That was fine, but as of September is no longer be the case, because I moved out to start grad school, which is awesome, and exciting, but also means I need to prioritize my time to pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I really, really don\u0027t want to stop helping writers. That would make me very sad. And I think it would make some writers sad, too. And being sad isn\u0027t fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon, you ask? Because I love helping writers, and I love sharing my work, and I love creating books and videos and I want to keep doing all of that. I also want to be able to\u2014eventually\u2014make a living writing full-time. So what better way to keep helping writers by talking about what I love than on a platform where we can help each other? A place where I can create a special community of people who get all the insider, behind-the-scenes information, as well as things to help you improve your writing skills and manuscripts, and a peek at things I know many of you are after, like what I\u0027m working on and those super-old, super-terrible manuscripts I\u0027ve trunked.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can give you special access to my work and brain you won\u0027t get anywhere else. And in return, you guise can help me continue to do what I love\u2014which is help you and give you more stories to read. It\u0027s a win for everyone, and much more fun than being sad, I think.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo will you join me?"
