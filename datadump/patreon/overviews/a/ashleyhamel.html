For the past 4 years, I\u0027ve been \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003erecording, producing, and writing original music,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003esinging with cover bands at weddings, corporate functions, and bars,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eperforming improv and organizing shows,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ehosting open mics,\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eplaying wizard rock in libraries, Harry Potter festivals, and conferences,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eteaching and developing creative programming at the Library,\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand anything else I have time to do! :P\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been an amazing, fulfilling journey so far, with great highs and lows. It\u0027s the artist\u0027s journey, and I\u0027m committed to spending my life sharing my love for singing and performing with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far, you haven\u0027t seen much of me on Youtube, and my studio recordings are pretty sparse (so far!). I live for the live show, for the moments we share with each other, breathing the same air and energy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been dandy up to this point, but I have many supporters and friends around the country and the world(!!) that I have been unable to reach because I mainly work in real time/space.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s time for something different!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kicked off my Patreon in early 2018 with a two-month-long residency in Indonesia. While there, I said I would \"hone my craft, meet interesting people, and expand the limits of what\u0027s possible\" and HEY I DID THAT!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what\u0027s next?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow that I\u0027m home, I\u0027ll be using Patreon to send you stories from my adventures, new thoughts on life, and general project updates. My newsletters will arrive 1-3x per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will also host a live online concert every month \u003cem\u003e(probably on Facebook Live? Maybe on Concert Window? stay tuned)\u003c/em\u003e that will be open to everyone, but will be funded by YOU. Everyone thanks you for sponsoring these future concerts. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease join me in this new endeavor and lend me your support. I am forever grateful to be your artist and to provide you comfort when you\u0027re suffering, passion when you need a push, and love through the shadows. Thank you so much for your support over the years.\u00a0I wouldn\u0027t be here without your belief in me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYours,\u003cbr\u003eAshley\u003cbr\u003e"
