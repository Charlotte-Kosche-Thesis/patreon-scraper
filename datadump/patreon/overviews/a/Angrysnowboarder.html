    "summary": "Thank you for stopping by. We\u0027re stoked you\u0027ve even taken this much interest in checking us out. In the last year we\u0027ve had a lot of people ask us about how they can help, well we think Patreon might be a part of the solution to the myriad of problems we face. Below you\u0027ll find a brief synopsis of what we have going on and why we\u0027re doing this. Or you could just watch the video. You should probably watch the video!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eBrief History:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Back in 2008 The Angry Snowboarder was formed. It wasn\u0027t anything extravagant and it certainly didn\u0027t seem like it would be here 9 years later, but it is. When it started there were almost 100 snowboard blogs, websites, and media entities. Of those that were there in 2008 we are one of two that remain. Over the years we\u0027ve broken stories, created some humorous comedy pieces, and done our best to define the other side of snowboarding. In 2017 we\u0027re tasked with the paradigm of adapt or die, we\u0027d prefer to adapt. That\u0027s why we\u0027re doing this Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThe Future:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The goal for the future is to keep adapting to the changing times. This includes creating new content on new mediums for you to enjoy while growing the reach of the brand and still remaining true to where we started from. Above all else just doing what we feel is important to representing snowboarding as we live it. Plus we have some cool ideas for new content we want to give you guys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThe Goals:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 The end goal is to supplement our costs on equipment, time, labor, and content creation. It\u0027s always tough to have to figure out funding when you have ideas for some killer content, but that\u0027s a fact of life. We\u0027ve done a lot with the little we have and we\u0027ll continue doing that.\u00a0 Also we need to feed Jon Cenacorn, you wouldn\u0027t believe how much he eats. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eThank You:\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Seriously thanks to everyone that\u0027s ever visited, watched, or engaged us in what we do. 9 years is an eternity on the Internet and yet you continue to come back and see what we\u0027re doing. As we\u0027ve had people ask us about how they can help, especially with funding, that\u0027s why we started this. So if you value what we do, donate. We promise we\u0027re not slowing down any time soon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again from,\u003cbr\u003eAvran\u003cbr\u003eKevin\u003cbr\u003eMarcus\u003cbr\u003eBen\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
