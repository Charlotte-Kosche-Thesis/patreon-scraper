    "summary": "I\u0027ve been writing commentary on topics of all sorts in various places on the Internet now for something like two decades now. Judging by the following I\u0027ve built on Quora, there\u0027s an interest in such commentary, but Quora isn\u0027t the place for it. And so I\u0027m going to be posting, here on Patreon, content that is either too long for Quora or not appropriate for Quora\u0027s format, that something inspires me to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are three categories of things that are likely to appear here. One will be longer essays that are inspired by (often expansions on, or perhaps commentaries about) a specific Quora answer I\u0027ve written. Another will be simply be essays on any other thing I come across (often, something in the news) that piques my interest enough to elicit a coherent written response. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe third is a project that I\u0027ve been mulling for some months, after a discussion on Quora: I\u0027m planning on rewatching the Original Series of Star Trek, in original airing order, and writing commentaries from the standpoint of someone who was alive when at least some of them aired (I was born in 1969).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther categories may arise as I find specific areas of interest to comment on. Commentaries on the technology industry, on computer games, and on law and politics (especially immigration policy, which I understand many people have strong feelings about today) are thus likely.\u003cbr\u003e"
