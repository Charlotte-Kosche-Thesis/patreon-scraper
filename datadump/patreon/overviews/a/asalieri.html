    "summary": "Who am I? I am known as the fat, gay, fat, calls-em-like-he-sees-em youtuber, Asalieri. Just call me Asa, most people do anyhow. I try to entertain my small but appreciative audience the only way I know how... by being as weird and off the cuff as I can possibly be. I favor audience participation content over straight videomaking. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have several series I have put on hold for the time being. However, I am not averse to bringing them back in order to make a few bucks on the side! Among them, Reviewing A Reviewer, the show that made 3 people online hate me forever and ever, Kickstarter Nightmares, the very antithesis to this thing I happen to be doing here, and WTH, a yearly contest where I test people\u0027s creativity in videomaking. Gimme a hand with finances and i\u0027ll give you back all i\u0027ve got, chief!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0Ideally, i\u0027d love to be able to do this full time. I do have real life expenses, like everyone else does. Might as well stick a tip jar in there and see. Don\u0027t donate if it will set you back any. Enjoy my content one way or another! I will never put a pay wall between you and my content!\u003cbr\u003e"
