    "summary": "Greetings! Welcome to The American State Flower Collection.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m creating a series of illustrations to express the beauty of all of America\u0027s official state flowers - one blossom at a time. This collection will gracefully evolve over the next four years and some months. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately, it will be held within a gorgeous publication that celebrates America\u0027s story, and its botanical heritage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an artist and a former museum professional with a deep love for the wondrously rich variety of America\u0027s natural and cultural history. I\u0027m on a quest to assemble a portrait of our country that draws from the somewhat curious phenomenon of its assortment of state flowers, and the stories that swirl around these. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAnd with my whole heart, I invite you to join me and help shape this unique\u00a0portrait. As this\u00a0will be co-created with my Patreon community, it quite literally won\u0027t be the same without you. During our monthly virtual meetings that you may join as a subscriber/collaborator, I\u0027ll welcome your feedback on that month\u0027s illustration-in-progress. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd we\u0027ll discuss the project\u0027s overall direction to generate ideas about how we may \"grow our garden\" by exploring questions like, \"How should we design the book?\" or ideally \"Gee, this project is doing so well, how may we pay it forward to botanic gardens around the country?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make that last bit a reality, clearly\u00a0the more the merrier for the American State Flower Collection. If you\u0027re intrigued with the idea of joining our group, I hope you\u0027ll pass the word on to all of your flower-loving friends and encourage them to jump in, too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you get if you sign up? Please check out the six subscription and reward levels I created, which respectively\u00a0offer a high-quality\u00a0digital download or archival print of each month\u0027s floral design (as I write this, the Texas Bluebonnet is well underway) and one or more copies of the final publication.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you know in your heart that our botanical \"book club\" is the place you want to be, I\u0027m ready and willing to speak further with you at your convenience, answer all of your questions, and be enlightened by your suggestions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAgain, thanks so much for your visit. I can\u0027t wait to welcome you into our project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWarmest,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCarole Anne\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "I am an artist who loves to draw. Perhaps due to my many years as a curator and creator of public place projects, people have to be a part of the equation. Or maybe I just naturally believe that everything is co-created. For me, the most inspiring thing is when art inspires people to see themselves and their own story in a new way, which seems to make them\u00a0enjoy being with others even more. For example, who\u0027d want to experience \u003cem\u003eHamilton\u003c/em\u003e all by themselves? Well, the idea of a bunch of us working together to nurture the evolution of \u003cem\u003eThe American State Flower Collection\u003c/em\u003e fills my heart with joy. I can\u0027t wait.\u00a0",
