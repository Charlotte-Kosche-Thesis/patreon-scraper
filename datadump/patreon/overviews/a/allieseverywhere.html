The site does this by giving them a voice and a platform to\ntell their story through our blog and digital resources. By having a place\nwhere everyone can learn about everyone, we can create intersectionality\nbetween groups and hopefully a better world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAlliesEverywhere is a crowd-sourced\ninformation hub with the goal of becoming a virtual community center for those\nmarginalized groups in society. We all know someone who has been negatively\nimpacted because they\u0027re labeled as different, and AlliesEverywhere is here to\nchange that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur ultimate goal is to expand and do\nmore than just talk. After building an interactive online library of links,\nresources, and helpful information that contributes to peace and tolerance, we\nwant to interact with communities both online and in person, creating a network\nwhere everyone is helping everyone else. Our philosophy is that with a strong\nfoundation of knowledge, and an eager community of those willing to help those\nin need, we can crowd-source a generally acceptable solution on how to coexist\non this wonderful pale blue dot of ours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur principle virtues are 1)\nInformation 2) Compassion and 3) Positivity.
