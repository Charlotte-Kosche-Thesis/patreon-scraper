My artwork, individual point of view, and how I see the world around me directly stems from my psychological health as I am an Artist with \u003ca href=\"https://mylifeandmentalillness.wordpress.com/2017/05/09/araks-story/\"\u003eDissociative Identity Disorder\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI survived 15 years of early and developmental childhood trauma.\u00a0 And live with a level of dissociative amnesia so severe at times I do not know or remember who I am.

Through visual art I am able to communicate what I am ill equipped to convey verbally.

While this painting is being directed by a part of myself that comes from the dark space and holds cold, stoic pain she also is helping me remember she\u0027s behind the self that so often smiles.  Apart from simply finishing this painting I wish to produce a full time-lapse video of it and write up a detailed blog post about the process (internal and external) and materials I used.  All these things take time but with your support, I can make it all happen sooner!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eI hope to make this journey as fun for you as it is meaningful for me.

Chesterton\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/0kcwvVS.jpg\"\u003e\nI recently moved and wanted to start my days here with a\nblank canvas. While I\u0027m very happy in my new neighborhood, and love my room,\nit\u0027s a bit smaller than where I moved from. So I thought why not begin this\ncanvas in limitation. I know it sounds odd, but I find limitations comforting.\nEverywhere we go in life it\u0027s affirmed that we are limitless, and the\npossibilities are endless, but I tend to have a better sense of space when I have a sense of confinement. With that in mind, my self-imposed limits for this piece are black and white\nacrylic paints only, and liquid gold leaf if I\u0027m feeling stuck. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m very grateful to be in my new space. And it feels really nice to finally be settled in so I can continue painting. The above #wip was done in one sitting where I was able to zone out, go back into\nmyself, and watch the painting happen in front of me. Looking forward to what\u0027s\nremembered through this piece.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI hope to make this journey as fun for\nyou as it is meaningful for me. Thank you for reading this far and learning\nabout me! If you support my Patreon at any level, you will be a significant\npart of helping me finish this painting and sharing the process. I hope you\nwill consider sharing this page with you friends and helping to grow this\ncommunity. I have a lot of exciting things planned but can only do it with your\nhelp!",

One of the many reasons I wanted to apply for membership is they are an organization of professional artists that have continuously exhibited their members\u0027 artwork for 90 years. The opportunity to hang my pieces alongside artists that have been thriving in the community is something I dream to do. So this month I decided my goal would be to create one piece of art geared toward a very specific exhibit PSA is apart of every year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cCelebrating Halloween and Dia de los Muertos\u201d\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003eat the \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePasadena Central Library\u003c/strong\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing that my art comes from a very raw, unconscious, and often painful place inside myself, at times it can be unsettling or emotionally provocative to the viewer. At face value it\u0027s been resonating with audiences attracted to \u003cem\u003eDark Art\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eLowbrow\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eHorror Art\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eEmotional Art\u003c/em\u003e with undertones of \u0027creepy\u0027 and \u0027strange\u0027. When I first started hearing how people experienced my art it sounded so far from the true, real experiences it stems from. It was hard to have it summed up by a gory genre everyone knows to be fake. But when I started \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003elistening\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e to how people experienced my art, I began to understand the value in what they were saying. Art therapy and intentions aside, if people love horror, and see my art in that style, they are connecting to it! And because of that connection, may even buy it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I thought, why not embrace this, especially during the Halloween season! In an effort to get an early jump on preparing this submission my June Goal will be dedicated to creating one painting in this theme!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to make this journey as fun for you as it is meaningful to me. Remember you can always change your pledge, so if you\u0027d like to help me reach my goal for June you can always switch back in the future. As always, feel free to share this page on social media and with friends to grow a community that loves the arts and supports healing from trauma. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove,\u003cbr\u003eArak",
