    "summary": "~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003eUPDATE: 18th of March 2017\u003cbr\u003e1.) If you own an indieGO! console and support us with 1\u20ac/month, you get an extended warranty on all parts. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2.) As soon we reach a collected sum of 300\u20ac I will choose randomly one of the existing patrons (which donated at least once = payment has to be completed) who will get a indieGO! XU4 pure system including 1x Joypad and USB-Hub.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3.) The price of an indieGO console for non-patrons of the project (an so non VIP\u0027s on \u003ca href=\"http://www.ares-shop.de)\"\u003ewww.ares-shop.de)\u003c/a\u003e is 80\u20ac higher. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e* Currently we are at 75\u20ac. In April it will be 150\u20ac if no one more applies as Patron.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe first winner of an indieGO! will be announced at 31th of March. So far the winning chance is 1:5 .. not bad :) \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome may know me from my projects already. I have seen patreon.com the first time when I checked out the Amiga CD32 Game \"Reshoot\" .\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSince I am offering AmiCloud and an AEROS subscription, I have thought it could be make sense to use this platform as well.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am not working alone.. to be honest the main work is done by others like Fabio Falcucci, Christoph Metering, and Szilard B\u00edro to name a few. So the contributions you are making here will be spend to pay them for additional tasks and works. The more we get support, the more time we can spend on our projects instead of making a run for a living.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that we can speed up development this way by a factor of 10. In the moment we develop.. try to sell.. wait until we have enough together and continue to develop.. This process is slow and happens only at weekends. With your help we can speed up things. And when you help us, you can also suggest us things and we will listen to you whenever it makes sense ; )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNever-ending projects are:\u003cbr\u003eAROS Broadway for i386\u003cbr\u003eThe indieGO! Appstore for Amiga, PC, Mac and the indieGO!\u003cbr\u003eEmuLA - the Emulation launcher\u003cbr\u003eAmiCloud the dropbox killer with no traffic limitation and soon the option to rend Virtual machines (pro users get one for free)\u003cbr\u003eProjekt Lila Remastered is now underway (you can still grab one of 500 copies)\u003cbr\u003eCatacomb 3D is in the works by Szilard Biro and licensed by Flat Rock Software.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAEROS is going to be available for Orange Pi\u003cbr\u003eThe indieGO! will become available soon and we would like to make it better with every software \u00a0update\u003cbr\u003eAmiworx started with a new project for us called \"Oh No! More Aliens\"\u003cbr\u003eand much much more... You can become part of this! Become a Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
