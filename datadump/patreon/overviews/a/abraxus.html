Also, both of us worked for an online board game company for a couple of years that unfortunately recently went out of business. So we\u0027re trying to go at it on our own! We have our families\u0027 support, now we just need yours!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere would my money go? And what do I get out of it?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLots of places! Luckily we are able to work out of our old offices from our time at Funagain. However, we will still need basic monthly utilities like lights and internet. We\u0027ll also need some equipment upgrades and upgrades to the office to make more awesome content. Maybe we\u0027ll eventually get to hire an extra person or two to help us out!\u003cbr\u003eIn return for being so AWESOME and supporting us, you guys will have early access to nearly everything that we create, as well as access to our discord server so you can talk with us about how to improve! You could also get exclusive content like our show, \"Well Played,\" every week. You\u0027ll also have access to Patreon exclusive print and play games! Those obviously won\u0027t come out every week, but we\u0027ll be making them as often as we can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo we get anything else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDefinitely! Even though we\u0027ve only specified a few rewards, those are the promised, surefire rewards you will get. However, we LOVE making content and games, so there will definitely be some surprise rewards along the way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the next few weeks we\u0027ll be updating our Patreon page and include an intro video, etc. So keep checking back! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIMPORTANT:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e The exclusive show, \"Well Played,\" will air it\u0027s first episode on May 3rd. The first few episodes of this series will be available to everyone, but beyond that, it will only be for subscribers of the $3 tier!
