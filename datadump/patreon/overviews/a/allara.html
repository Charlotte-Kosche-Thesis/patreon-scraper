    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWar of Words 2 will shut down if the servers aren\u0027t funded. To find out why, and how you can help, read on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the beginning\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/war-of-words-free/id395392584?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWar of Words\u003c/a\u003e was released in February 2011. It was the first word game to feature \"Action Tiles\", including things like Bombs and Multipliers. Players loved it, but I had an idea for something more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn June of 2012, I released a sequel, entitled\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/war-of-words-2/id646132288?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWar of Words Apocalypse\u003c/a\u003e. This introduced a ton of new concepts, including player levels, titles, and avatars, as well as a variety of new Action Tiles and board layouts. The first expansion, Jungle of the Elements, followed in January 2013. The second and last expansion pack, The Sands of Time, came out in July 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBoth games were well received by players, but the media never seemed to catch on. As a result, the games were very niche, only played by a few thousand people at a time, and they didn\u0027t make much money. I was thousands of dollars in debt (art, hardware, and server costs), and things weren\u0027t improving. I spent several years doing my best to market, pitch, and improve the game, learning lots of things about social media and everything else you need to know. But still, nothing much happened.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWar of Words 2\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, I was approached by\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://everplayinteractive.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEverplay Interactive\u003c/a\u003e. They wanted to bring War of Words Apocalypse to a wider audience. They thought their connections with Apple and with the media, as well as their ability to advertise and acquire users, could mean that War of Words would explode. I thought it was a great opportunity, so I agreed. We rebranded the game as \"\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/war-of-words-2/id646132288?mt=8\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWar of Words 2\u003c/a\u003e\", and timed the release to coincide with the new Sands of Time expansion pack.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverplay did a great job, but the media and Apple continued to hate on word games. As a result, we got no coverage at all. Users who found the game via advertising just didn\u0027t \"get it\", and they dropped by the thousands. In the end, we were back where we started\u2014except I no longer owned the game.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eServers are expensive\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWar of Words 2 runs on servers, as you know. This is how the players interact with each other on the shared game board. Unfortunately, those servers were designed to handle a \u003cem\u003elot\u003c/em\u003e more players than what we ended up getting. (For the technically minded: the biggest architectural decision was choosing to use\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/simpledb/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon SimpleDB\u003c/a\u003e for the database. This is something I can\u0027t back away from now, and it\u0027s one of the biggest costs to keep the game running.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince the game didn\u0027t succeed financially, Everplay was left footing a rather expensive server bill. Unfortunately, the game wasn\u0027t bringing in much money. We scaled down as best we could, but there is a minimum floor where the costs just won\u0027t go down any further. That\u0027s where we\u0027re at now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn May of 2015, War of Words 2 earned just $3.50 for Everplay. The servers for that month cost $350. It\u0027s just not tenable.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverplay loyally paid for the servers for two years, but ultimately they had to cut their losses. As a result, they decided to terminate their agreement to pay for the servers. I can\u0027t blame them\u2014it was only out of the goodness of their hearts that they spent the thousands and thousands of dollars out of pocket to keep it going this long.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUpdate: September 2016\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEverplay went out of business and completely disappeared sometime in 2016. I only found out about this because I went to renew the push notification certificates, something I am required to do every year, but Everplay had not renewed their developer account with Apple. This locked me out of Apple\u0027s system, and although I tried to contact Everplay, all my efforts failed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo in order to keep the game running, I had no choice but to pull it from Everplay and re-publish under my own company, Wolf Studios.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, we\u0027re still left with the same problem as before: the servers are expensive, and Store purchases and advertising generate almost no revenue since there are very few players left and all of them already paid for what they wanted. Even though Everplay is no longer in the picture, I will have to wind this game down if I can\u0027t keep it funded somehow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen Everplay announced their decision, I decided to shut the game down. The servers were originally planned to shut down on July 31, 2015.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then something amazing happened: \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e. You wrote in by the hundreds, offering to pay to keep the game alive. But I couldn\u0027t think of a way to make that work.\u00a0Then I remembered Patreon. It\u0027s designed for exactly this sort of thing: an artist with a bunch of like-minded fans who want to support the work. That\u0027s you, and this is how we\u0027ll get it done.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I encourage you to pledge as much support as you think is fair. There are some cosmetic rewards, as well as some rewards from the in-game Store. But the main thing you\u0027re doing by pledging is ensuring this game stays alive and kicking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!\u003c/strong\u003e"

The battle will continue\u2014but who will survive?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny amount pledged above this goal will be spent towards future server time. I\u0027m paying the monthly bill for the servers first, then putting the rest of the money into a separate account to be used towards paying for them in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI expect pledges to drop off over time (they already have), so it\u0027s helpful to be above the goal for a while. I don\u0027t expect us to stay this high forever\u2014at that point, the game might shut down. That\u0027s why it\u0027s nice to be able to put aside some extra money right now while we have more support.\u003cbr\u003e",
