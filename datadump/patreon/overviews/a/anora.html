I love to concoct my own blend of different styles of music: classical, folk, pop, electronic dance, rock, new age, etc. I notice the different elements of music that make me feel something peaceful or exciting or passionate and I try to implement them into my songs. To me, music is magic! It makes us feel alive. It heals and empowers us. My hope is that my music will bring a little bit more magic into the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like to support me, I will be using your donations to produce professional recordings of my music. If I receive enough support, I will be creating some beautiful music videos for my songs so that they can be enjoyed visually as well. I appreciate any support you would like to give. It speeds up the process of production and allows me to make my music the best it can be.\u003cbr\u003e"
