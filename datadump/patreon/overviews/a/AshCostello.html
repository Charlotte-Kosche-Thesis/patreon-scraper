     "description": "So my first goal, is to just improve everything I do. So far patreon pledges have helped buy better costumes for the gangsta video, help us build are stage set for warped tour, and so much more! \u00a0I just want to improve the content I put out overall.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlso, the more pledges I get the more I will be able to donate to animal shelters. So far we have donated a total of a little over 2k combined over the past several months to several different Animal shelters and rescues. I usually post a screen shot of the donation if its online, or a photo of the supplies purchased being dropped off.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal\u00a0is to buy better youtube ( not just youtube but for making tutorial videos on any platform in general) equipment, team and space! Right now, we have tiny lights, no mics, and my room to do youtube videos in and I accidentally deleted two good ones cause Im technologically not advanced haha. So I would like to hire someone to edit and help me! I want to take youtube for you guys to a whole new level!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal, is to take my cosplay photoshoots to a whole new level! Im still far off from this, but it IS my ultimate goal. as its SO expensive to have cisplay costumes made, or to buy the supplies to make it yourself. Hiring the photographer, sometimes a make up artist, making the costumes, renting the space, it isnt free, and I love doing my versions of cosplay and love seeing you reactions to them! I have so many characters I want to do!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Sindel from Mortal Kombat\u003cbr\u003e-Little mermaid\u003cbr\u003e-Darth Vader\u003cbr\u003e-Negan\u003cbr\u003e-More Harley Quinn\u003cbr\u003e-Khaleesi\u003cbr\u003e-Johnny the Homicidal Maniac\u003cbr\u003e-Morticia\u003cbr\u003e-Enchantress\u003cbr\u003e-Kylo Ren\u003cbr\u003e-And any suggestions you guys have!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal-\u003cbr\u003eMusic videos for the Malevolence album cycle is over...
