    "summary": "My name is Andy Deane, and you might know me from my\nbands The Rain Within or Bella Morte, or from the horror novels I\u0027ve written.  Either way, I\u0027m glad you found your way\nhere!  I\u0027ve been a touring musician for\n20 years and absolutely love what I do. I have toured the US\ncountless times and have also had the pleasure of carrying my music to Canada,\nthe UK, and Europe.  During this time I\nhave released 10 full length albums and several EPs between my music\nprojects.  And I am still sitting on\nquite a large vault of finished, unreleased music.  Some of these songs just didn\u0027t fit with the\nsound my bands were producing at the time while others didn\u0027t make it to albums\nbecause of time constraints.  And so I\npresent to you my Orphans;  songs I have\nwritten with love and care that have not had an opportunity to step into the\nlight of day.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve been considering starting a Patreon campaign for a while now, and finally\ndecided to pull the trigger.  I want to\ncreate a very close relationship with those who choose to support my music\nhere.  It is not always easy making a\nliving as a musician, and your contributions will afford me the time to continue\ndoing what I love to do.  This will be\nthe closest thing I\u0027ve had to a steady income in quite some time, and I will\nhave you to thank for that. \u00a0I haven\u0027t had health care for a while now, and that needs to change. You can make a huge, positive impact on my life and my art by helping out here. And I\nguarantee I\u0027ll make it worth your while! \nI\u0027m not going to dump a bunch of demos recorded on a cassette player in\nan old basement on you!  The songs I\nrelease here will be well-recorded, original material (with an occasional cover\nfor fun!).  There will be unreleased\nBella Morte and The Rain Within songs from time to time as well that won\u0027t be\navailable anywhere else for at least 6 months! Some will never be released elsewhere! I am very\nexcited to let these tracks find homes!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI plan on releasing 1 or 2 songs each month, and if I ever go above\nand beyond the call of duty you won\u0027t have anything to worry about because\nPatreon allows you to set a maximum per-month spending limit.  And not only will you be getting these unique\npieces of music, you\u0027ll also get discounted and/or free merchandise depending on the tier you choose!  I will also be offering karaoke versions of some songs for you to sing along to! \u00a0That should lead to all kinds of YouTube magic! :)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you enjoy what I\u0027m creating and want to support me I can\u0027t thank you\nenough!  There are no words to express\nthe extent of my appreciation.  You guys\nare truly the blood in my artistic veins! \u0026lt;3"
