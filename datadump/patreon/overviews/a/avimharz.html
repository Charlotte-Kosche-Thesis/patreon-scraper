    "summary": "So if you stumbled upon this page randomly. Please please PLEASE take some time to read what I do and why I\u0027m here and just plainly hear my story out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst off, Hi, I\u0027m Mharz from Philippines. Clearly I am not American but you know I hope you don\u0027t mind where I\u0027m from. I live in not a very rich country where you\u0027re expected to just graduate from school get a boring office job in a corporate (ughhh..) company. Get married, have kids, pay bills and die. That is something I don\u0027t want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I decided to become an artist and literally flush four years of my computer science college life down to drain. \u003cu\u003eI love to draw and create\u003c/u\u003e and for me, a career in arts is definitely the most fulfilling. I was fortunate enough to get into an animation studio and learn their craft and that totally helped me improve my art. I worked for that studio for three years then I decided to leave because I want to have more \u003cstrong\u003e#FREEDOM\u003c/strong\u003e in how I draw and what to create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe result: I shifted to comics and so far I have\u003cstrong\u003e two ongoing webcomics\u003c/strong\u003e that I can proudly show to the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, my main comic\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blackwings.mharz.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Angel with Black Wings\u003c/a\u003e. \u003c/strong\u003eThis comic actually started as a short animation project from a short course I took but then I decided to expand it and turn it into a really long comic series. I\u0027ve been working on this for three years now, YAY!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://blackwings.mharz.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img01.deviantart.net/f788/i/2017/069/8/1/h_tapastic_cover_resize_by_avimharz-db1w6q8.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a drama/fantasy webcomic about the friendship of a boy and an angel. These two became friends after The Angel saved that boy\u0027s life and eventually both of them got involved in each other\u0027s problems.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore about the story on this link:\u00a0\u003ca\u003ehttp://blackwings.mharz.com/about\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003eMy second webcomic is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://champs.mharz.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCHAMPS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://champs.mharz.com\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img14.deviantart.net/f515/i/2017/210/4/c/tapas_champs_benner_by_avimharz-dbi6g46.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eThis webcomic is about an MMA\u0027s conquest in the octagon and in love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore about this comic on this link:\u00a0\u003ca\u003ehttp://champs.mharz.com/about\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eSo why the heck am I here on Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e is basically a support platform for creators like myself much like Kickstarter. You can donate for as low as $1 but the thing is unlike Kickstarter, Patreon is a \u003cu\u003emonthly thing.\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0In exchange for your buck, I will provide some lovely-lovely valuable stuffs exclusively for those who will pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I want to create more awesome works to show to everyone, I have to eat, sleep and pay bills like a responsible adult. I\u0027m fortunate that I can get by through doing commissions, having savings and also there\u0027s my family circumstances but I\u0027m aware that this isn\u0027t going last forever so now, I\u0027m going to start building this slowly and hopefully in few years I can finally just focus on making my original contents without worrying about whether I have enough to pay for stuffs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI really believe that I can do it with my abilities and with your help, I will be able to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite me saying that, let it be known that THIS IS \u003cu\u003eNOT\u003c/u\u003e A MANDATORY THING. You\u0027re free to pledge to me if you want. I\u0027m not forcing you onto anything. Besides, I\u0027d feel really great if you\u0027re pledging to me from the bottom of your heart. My webcomics and artworks are free to view regardless. It\u0027s just that being a patron to me will have additional perks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, if you really can\u0027t afford to be a patron you can always show support by \u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003esharing\u003c/u\u003e\u00a0my works to the internet and spread the word of it\u0027s existence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking a couple of minute in reading my little story and if you decide to give at least $1 to me every month, you have my undying gratitude.\u003cbr\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, you can follow me on social sites and be friends with me there.
