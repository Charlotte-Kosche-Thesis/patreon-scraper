But now I have renewed my focus on expanding my work through four distinct projects, all designed to continue the expansion of the shared Quadrant Universe. The first is my ongoing novel series focused on the universe\u0027s premiere hero, now three books deep,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://superpoweredfiction.blogspot.com/search/label/Lightweight\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLIGHTWEIGHT\u003c/a\u003e.

This Patreon is all about giving you the ability to support the free\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eWALKING SHADOWS\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0product as well as regularly get new work delivered directly to your email box.

None of them want to be any kind of super powered hero, but they find themselves forced by a mysterious organization into a unit for their own defense. In the process, they form a lasting bond that continues to grow through the series as life, love and death change their world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIan Page is the main lead. He is a young master of psychic illusions with no memory of his past before the start of Book One. He gathers the likes of Stomp - a super-strong jumper, Cyrus - an elusive master of sound, Alli - a ghost-seeing troubleshooter, Marilyn - a shape-shifter in the body of a 50s movie icon, and Rosa - a super-speedster running from her past in her native Mexico. Those six young people form the core of an ever expanding cast as the legend of the \u003cstrong\u003eWALKING SHADOWS\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0grow as the series progresses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/--u2KjPTj9Hg/VjQcmrmi24I/AAAAAAAADQs/AFxWeTwqZPc/s1600/WalkingShadowsBoth500wide.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first two books of \u003cstrong\u003eWALKING SHADOWS\u003c/strong\u003e are already available online to read at any time, either on the home page or as Kindle ebooks.

The basic goals are pretty simple, from getting a dedicated domain to adding more graphics to the site. As the levels grow, you\u00a0can help make even more than that possible, from bonus pages every week, extra content exclusive to Patreon supporters and even more online serials. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith adequate funding, I will debut a new piece of fiction as a serial.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eCOSMIC! \u003c/strong\u003eis a space-spanning saga of heroes human and alien in a giant universe filled with dangerous threats. The rag-tag band at the center of the series will find themselves up against a threat that threatens the entire galaxy, even if they are the last group anyone wants to stop it.
