    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT THE BAND...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter touring eight countries across Europe, the UK, and the Middle East last year, Swiss-based artist ADAYA and her band (comprised of musicians from Europe and North America), have released their first album The Other Side.\u003cbr\u003eThe Other Side is a prophetic album rooted deep in folk traditions from the British Isles and steeped in colors of contemporary psychedelic folk. \u003cbr\u003eADAYA\u0027s poetic and mature songwriting is the result of many years of traveling and from being an uncompromising full-time musician.\u003cbr\u003eAdaya Lancha Bairacli was primarily a solo artist until 2014, when she began collaborating with the multi-talented American bassist Aaron Goldsmith.\u003cbr\u003eTheir band began to expand in 2015 with the addition of Buck Curran, who gives an ethereal touch with his Electric Guitar (for the past decade he\u0027s been a member of the renown American Psych-Folk duo Arborea).\u003cbr\u003eAlso in the current line-up is Swiss percussionist Corinne Windler also well known in the Jazz scene. ADAYA\u0027s music has been compared with the ,music that developed out of the Folk Rock scene of late 60\u0027s and 70\u2019s.\u003cbr\u003eWithout being purely nostalgic, ADAYA\u2019s lyrics are deeply intuitive and always thoughtful, and while rooted in classic progressive folk and the experimental side of psychedelic music, everything is complimented into a unique perfection and makes her music sound timeless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.folkradio.co.uk/2017/03/adaya-the-other-side/\"\u003eFolk Radio UK\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0recently described ADAYA\u0027s music: \"This is high caliber music, both stunning and original in concept and delivery, we\u2019re looking forward to hearing more\".\u003cbr\u003eADAYA and her band will tour extensively in Europe throughout the Year of 2017, presenting The Other Side ...which already stands as a contemporary classic and the beginning of a promising career.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT ADAYA...\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdaya is a talented songwriter with honest lyrics in a unique and passionate style.\u003cbr\u003eDrawing on the folk traditions of many cultures, her music has moved audiences throughout Europe.  \u003cbr\u003eTime and time again she travels to places where the songs and cultures enrich her imagination.\u003cbr\u003eInspired by the festive medieval scene in Switzerland, as well as the international community of street performers and troubadours traveling the world, Adaya made an early commitment to live from and for her music, and has not looked back since.  \u003cbr\u003eWith banjo, guitar and her charismatic voice she performs her own songs, along with a handfull of Irish and English ballads and leads the band with grace and an open heart.  \u003cbr\u003eBesides her band, Adaya can be found playing harp, flute, voice, and bagpipe for mystic medieval folk group \u003ca href=\"http://kelamrun.ch/wordpress/\"\u003eKel Amrun \u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAdaya also has her solo project as a Harpist, more information about the music and booking inquiries you can find here;\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.adaya.net/about-us/adaya-celtica/\"\u003eAdaya Celtica\u003c/a\u003e  \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT YOUR SUPPORT IS FOR...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs a freelance musician it can be quite hard nowadays to keep the work and spirits high. \u003cbr\u003eThis is the truth for many artists in this world. Music is everywhere, almost free to access. \u003cbr\u003eThey put their sweat \u0026amp; tears in their work to give us a few minutes of freedom.. to live in the moment. \u003cbr\u003eBut creating Album\u0027s, Video\u0027s, getting Band members from Italy, Turkey and elsewhere to a gig... Nothing is free. \u003cbr\u003eEither way, it\u0027s all worth it though!\u003cbr\u003eAdaya create\u0027s from the scratch her own music, related to our time and to what we need now!\u003cbr\u003eWith her very simple and cheap way of living (quite amazing how she does this, in one of the most expensive countries of Europe!) it\u0027s not impossible to survive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, for Adaya to work as much as she does on music, she can\u0027t have a job at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s one or the other - she chose the other.\u003cbr\u003eIf you really appreciate what Adaya and her band does, if they can give you some moment\u0027s of bliss with their sound, this is a great way to keep yourself always up to date and especially to make life for an artist possible!\u003cbr\u003e"
