    "summary": "I\u0027m Abby Artemisia, a Botanist by degree, Herbalist by training, and Forager by practice. In this crazy and often uncertain world we live in, it seems more important than ever to relearn and return to the old ways of growing and gathering our own food and medicine, and learning hands-on, in the true meaning of the word, \"apprenticeship\".\u003cbr\u003eTo accomplish that, I\u0027m opening the WANDER School, or the Wild Artemisia Nature Discovery, Empowerment, and Reconnection School. The mission of the school is to inspire reconnection with nature to empower a healthier world with many stewards.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI believe this information should be accessible to everyone, despite background, experience, location, financial status, etc. So I\u0027m asking you to support me to create videos, blogs, and assorted content on the botany, identification, and edible and herbal information about wild plants and DIY herbalism. Besides videos, I\u0027m working on edible and medicinal plant card decks, a foraging planner (a seasonal guide to what to harvest when, where, and how, along with recipes and beautiful illustrations by my friend, ethnobotanist, and artist, Becky Beyer at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bloodandspicebush),\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/bloodandspicebush),\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0a wild foods cookbook, and some other exciting up and coming projects. Your support can make it all possible. Thanks for your help!"
