Raptor and EDEN Optera have opened this patreon as a \u0027tip jar\u0027 for starting out our animation career.\u00a0 We have begun animating with blender, and the results have been impressive.\u00a0 We would like to eventually do this for a living, and perhaps a bit more.\u00a0 Therefore, this is open to those who want to help us get started as serious animators, or perhaps just like our work.\u00a0 We have outlined some Tiers and Goals that are reasonable, and should reflect what is actually possible if the support is there.\u00a0 Our themes include forest and garden scenarios with kinky plants, as well as dragons, lizards, insects, and aliens.\u00a0 Also\u00a0 laboratory scenes with creative equipment and experiments are a fun topic as well.\u00a0 Other species are welcome as we progress.\u00a0 Most of our animations will be of an adult nature, but we are not opposed to a few heartwarming SFW renders as well.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
