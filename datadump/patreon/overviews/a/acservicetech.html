    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eI am grateful to be able to use this platform to reach you with content and for you to support the ongoing work of the AC SERVICE TECH Channel to help train our current and future technicians in the trades. In return for your support, I will be posting Patreon only content as described below.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat is Patreon and why do you use it?\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.treatlyme.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/The-WhereAm-Iin-MyTreatmentTest-e1466303141375-660x330.jpg\" style=\"width: 278px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you\u0027re not familiar with Patreon, the concept is that you support a creator financially for each piece of valuable content they create for you. In my case, it\u0027s HVAC Educational Videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe in this concept wholeheartedly as it helps creators such as myself bringing you value in terms of HVAC Training Videos by making it financially sustainable in the long haul. Please consider supporting my work with a dollar (or however you much you like) per YouTube training that I create.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach month I tend to publish about 6-8 YouTube training videos to the ACSERVICETECH Channel, Each time I do this, I share that YouTube training here and mark it as a piece of content that you are supporting. The amount of YouTube trainings I publish that month determines how much you would contribute. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere is an example:\u003cbr\u003eI\u003cstrong\u003ef you pledged $1 per YouTube training and that month I published 7 videos then you would contribute $7 for that month.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t want to go over your budget, you can set a monthly contribution limit when you enter your payment info. This way if I happen to get overzealous and come out with a lot of trainings very fast then there won\u0027t be any surprises!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, you could pledge $3 per YouTube training, get access to the rewards at that tier, but cap your monthly contribution limit to $9. This way you don\u0027t go over your budget for that month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do the Rewards for each Tier Work?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are 5 levels to contribute through \"Support\", \"Community\", \"Insider\", \"YouTube\", and \"Business\". Each of these levels are stated on the right hand side of this page and there are rewards associated with each level. The content rewards stated at each of these levels will be in the form of Q\u0026amp;A, Communication, New Articles, and New Videos posted on the Patreon platform as prescribed in each of the levels. You will also see the same videos posted here on Patreon as you do at the ACSERVICETECH Youtube Channel as well. The reward videos and articles however are separate and only posted here to the Patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Support Level gives higher priority to answering questions. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Community Level will receive Community articles and videos as well as the lower level rewards. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Insider level, I will be looking for emails from the individuals in that level so that I can make one Patreon video every quarter addressing all of the questions I can answer in a 1/2 hour long video. In this Insider Level, you would receive the lower level rewards as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The YouTube level- Let\u0027s discuss what I can share regardless of what type of Channel that you are trying to build. I would love to share, especially for a Channel supporting our Valued Trades. We will discuss plans to get your Channel off the ground. We will discuss successes and fails from my journey. I will share tips for Youtube search and why videos rank. We will discuss ongoing strategy and planning for your Channel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-The Business Level, I can communicate with the General Manager, Owner, or Future Owner (whoever is the Business level Patron) to share ideas to possibly reduce overhead, increase efficiency, and gain the type of individuals that you would like to have work for you. Every Business has a location and every location will have a different business model associated. We can communicate to share ideas and goals. This will be an open communication of possible ideas and the business owner will decide which ideas to pursue on their own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will be expecting emailed questions or questions posted through Patreon that I can help all of our Patrons with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Do Your Contributions Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.ittefaq.com.bd/assets/images/news_images/2016/02/25/1456409281.jpg\" style=\"width: 291px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Support enables\u00a0me to continue to make these free YouTube HVAC Training Videos. Each of these videos may be 5 or 15 minutes\u00a0long but each take hours upon hours to develop and fine tune before you watch them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Support enables me not to worry about the financial and time requirements needed to make these videos and allows me to invest in the equipment, supplies, and replacements needed to develop these training videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a story for you and it involves a loving son and a Dad that can\u0027t get mad. One morning as I was working on editing a video my son said, \"Papa give me a hug!\" He had his arms wide open and was coming toward me. Before I could say stop, Seth knocked over a full cup of water and it splashed right into my laptop and then magically, everything was gone. \u00a0I couldn\u0027t say anything and gave my son his hug. There was $700 dollars gone in a computer but more importantly many pictures of the family as well as videos and pictures made for our channel. Then there were the recovery fees. I am now on my third laptop since starting the Channel along with two, count them two, external hard drives along with various recording equipment and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u00a0\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch1\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u003cimg src=\"https://wafatariq.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/3707187124_546942ec87.jpg\" style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(5, 45, 73); width: 278px;\"\u003e\u003c/h1\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Name is Craig Migliaccio and I have owned a local HVAC business in Southern New Jersey for over 12 years.
