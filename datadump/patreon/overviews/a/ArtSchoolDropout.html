    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Jessee Maloney and I have been the owner and operator of Art School Dropout / \u003ca href=\"http://www.artschooldropout.net\"\u003ewww.artschooldropout.net\u003c/a\u003e for 14 years now. I started out making bags and jewelry that I sold at local shops. Within the first year I expanded to selling all over the world and traveled monthly selling my wares at large craft fairs. I continued growing and expanding this way for 7 years, and only slowed down because I became pregnant. I slowed down drastically to focus more time on my daughter, which I am so grateful for. I took up quilting during this time too! When she turned three, I started putting more effort back in the my business and changed things around a bit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to this year... \u003cbr\u003e+ I am now a professional quilter with a bunch of projects and sponsors under my belt. \u003cbr\u003e+ I am a quilt pattern designer who designs for myself and does technical work for others.\u003cbr\u003e+ I dabble in fabric design and have over 500 designs on spoonflower.com. I LOVE creating repeat designs and illustrations.\u003cbr\u003e+ I am also still making jewelry and accessories, but using all the new technologies out there that I can get my hands on.\u003cbr\u003e+ I am a member of a local makerspace in Lessburg, VA where I use the laser cutter and 3D printers. I will be learning how to use all the other equipment over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of this is a lot of fun, however it gets hard finding time to create new content when I am constantly doing work for others so I can pay for supplies and other overhead cost.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo here I am on Patreon looking to share content and how to\u0027s while also covering costs. This is all a learning process for me, so if you have any suggestions of what you would like to see, please let me know!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can get an idea of what I create here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ehttps://art-school-dropout.myshopify.com/\u003cbr\u003e"
