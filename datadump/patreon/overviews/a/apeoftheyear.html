Pushing the WW2 flightSim community and helping Beginners get into the Scene is one of my biggest hobbys. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing videos and tutorials for flight sims is not paying off. I do it for fun, to support the flight sim community and to teach beginners how to get into it all, but unfortuneately it takes alot of time.\u003cbr\u003eSupport me and I will put a lot more work in my channel and regard working on new videos more than just a hobby. If I make a relevant amount of money by making these videos I will take the time and deliver much more. On top of that one of my goals includes organising flight tournaments and create a competitive Scene.\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to pledge money this will improve the quality and especially quantity of my work and I will consider it my duty to pay you back with the given goals that i have set up for myself.\u003cbr\u003eWorking on my Youtube channel is a big passion for me, and I will continue to work on it, no matter how successfull my patreon account is, however I wont have much time to invest since making even the simplest Youtube Video easily takes about 4 hours (A Review with lots of Scenes can be 20-30 Hours of work) if you have some standarts on the production qualitity and dont just upload an unedited gamestream.\u003cbr\u003eIf I ever reach a monthly amount of money that really pays of\u00a0 I will not only do more Youtube related Stuff, but i will begin to persue my biggest Dream right now: I will first begin to take real flight lessons and eventually start to build my own plane with a kit for a lightweight plane (sth like a SD1 Minisport), I know you probably don\u00b4t believe me that i am able to do such a thing, but I am a good Craftsman.\u003cbr\u003eWe can make it happen and you can be a part of that! Of course you will get to see everything too, and watch it all on Youtube as i progress with the lessons and the work on the plane. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for reading all this and beeing a viewer of my Videos, even if you don\u00b4t pledge anything you have already helped me and I really appreciate you!\u003cbr\u003e"
