Here\u0027s what you\u0027ll need to know:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eWhat is \u003cem\u003eAdventurers Wanted\u003c/em\u003e?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cem\u003eAdventurers Wanted\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is a series of shows that mash-up tabletop role-play games (like Dungeons \u0026amp; Dragons) and theatre, to create performances of epic, hilarious, tragic and unpredictable stories. The shows range from one-offs to monthly performances to marathon games, with anything from four to hundreds of player-performers involved; we try to make what we do as accessible as possible, from live-tweeting and live streaming all our shows to featuring relaxed and BSL-interpreted performances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the core of it, we\u0027re a group trying to create opportunities for\u00a0people to play together, tell stories together, and create worlds together. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cem\u003eAdventurers Wanted \u003c/em\u003eis run by just two people (Chloe \u0026amp; Chris). It takes a lot of time, effort - and, yes, money - to write, organise and run all of our different shows. Now, we\u0027re not shy of putting in ridiculous levels of commitment to \u003cem\u003eAdventurers Wanted \u003c/em\u003e(that our first show ran for 10 hours a day for 25 days tells you everything you need to know about that!) - but we want to improve and build upon what we\u0027re doing. That means:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBetter tech equipment like cameras and mics to improve livestream quality\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMore access provision - BSL interpretation, live captioning, braille character sheets and dice...\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHaving the opportunity and resources to develop/launch shows around gaming systems other than D\u0026amp;D\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eInvesting in our theatre tech - whether that\u0027s physical equipment or, for instance, paying for specialist sound effects libraries for shows\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBeing able to spread the word more effectively and comprehensively with marketing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eRunning R\u0026amp;Ds on staging games - exploring and developing practical effects, sound, lighting, design and other ways to bring the stories to life as quickly as they\u0027re created\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically: without Patreon, \u003cem\u003eAdventurers Wanted\u003c/em\u003e will still happen. But it\u0027ll be a much more difficult and much slower path to push it to its potential of bringing the most legendary kinds of story to vivid life, for as many people as possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of tabletop roleplaying games, becoming a patron means you\u0027ll be a part of our grand scheme to make games more accessible, develop new systems that put role-play front and centre, and create an expansive, detailed multiverse that ultimately anyone could play in. We want to take the games we love, share them with as many people as possible, and encourage them all to get involved and become players themselves - so you\u0027d be helping us grow the gaming community too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re a fan of theatre, becoming a patron means you\u0027re actively helping us to take an under-represented art form and use it to make live performance that truly takes advantage of being live. The team behind \u003cem\u003eAdventurers Wanted\u003c/em\u003e are from theatre backgrounds, and we see this as a format for long-form narrative improvisation that could be a new way of making imaginative, fun and inclusive performance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn a short time, we\u0027ve built up a growing community of collaborators and fans around or shows \u2013 and we\u0027d love you to be a part of it!\u003cbr\u003e"
