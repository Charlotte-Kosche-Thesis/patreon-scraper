    "summary": "Hello,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Brad, and I run the YouTube channel animateorange, where I build 3D metal models. I have decided to start a Patreon. I am not looking to make a living off of making videos. I enjoy making the videos and building the models, but the models can be a bit pricey. I want to keep the build videos coming, and have so far managed to keep models on hand, but my supply is running out, and there is so much more to build. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your pledge, I will be able to offset the cost of new models. I will be able to continue making new build videos and be able to bring bigger and more intricate model builds to you, the viewer. That\u0027s not to say without help the videos will stop, but they might slow down in time. Do I need the money? No. I am doing ok. Building these models is a hobby for me. Making the videos is a fun learning experience. If you like the videos I make and wish to support the making of more videos, then it is pretty much up to you to give what you feel like giving. I thank you for it. If you are not comfortable or do not want to become a patron, that is fine. It\u2019s up to you. My videos will still be there for everyone to watch. I intend to use Patreon funding to invest in new models first. Anything extra would go to perhaps trying out and reviewing different tools related to building models, possibly investing in better video equipment and software, and the occasional giveaway. The models come first though. Being a contributor would also give you direct access to make suggestions and recommendations influencing the direction of this channel. I am always open to requests. Being a contributor would mean your request would move to the front of the line. Ultimately, I would like to go ad-free on my YouTube channel. If I am able to reach $50 a month, I will begin removing ads from my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your attention.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKeep on keeping on,\u003cbr\u003eBrad\u003cbr\u003e"
