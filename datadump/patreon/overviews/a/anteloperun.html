    "summary": "The Antelope Run Rewilding Project is forty acres of ranch land some fifty miles west of Flagstaff.  The land, sparsely populated by junipers, grasses, and a few cacti, is beautiful but sadly overgrazed.  We\u2019ve heard story after story from our new neighbors about gardens and livestock decimated by the local wildlife because the animals have little else to eat in the area.  We would like to get a little homestead going with a garden and a flock of chickens, but we realize this is going to be challenging in such an unbalanced ecosystem. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of building maximum security facilities for our garden and livestock as many of our neighbors have done, we are going to try something a little different.\u00a0We want to provide for the antelope and other wildlife we see every day as well as for ourselves.  Our experiment will be to find ways to work with nature in a mutually beneficial relationship instead of trying to wrestle a living from it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe costs of our experiment are detailed below:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe first thing we need to do is to give the land a rest from the cattle.  They are cute and pleasant, but out here on the open range they are munching the grasses down to stubble.  The plan is to put a wildlife-permeable fence around the forty acres to keep the cattle out but allow other creatures to pass through.  If we do the labor ourselves and source recycled posts, we figure the fence will cost about $1500.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext, we are going to cover as much of the ground as we can with local grass and wildflower seeds. Seeds are going to be expensive. \u00a0With your help we will do a little at a time. \u00a0When the grass starts to grow back we will bring in bees and butterflies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next steps in this experiment are to be determined. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are very grateful for the opportunity to steward this land.  We welcome your support and we are excited to share this adventure with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAside from Patreon, our other fundraising effort is to host campers for $15 per night.
