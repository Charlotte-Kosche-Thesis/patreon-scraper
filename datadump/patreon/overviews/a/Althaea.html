    "summary": "My name is Althaea Sebastiani and I\u2019m a spirit led small \u201ct\u201d trad witch with 20+ years of practice under my belt. I\u2019ve been publicly writing about witchcraft and Paganism since 2010 and my message has remained constant throughout this time. I\u2019m not the witch who\u2019s going to hold your hand and tell you you\u2019re pretty. I\u2019m not going to fluff your ego and accept your excuses because I \u003cem\u003eknow\u003c/em\u003e you\u2019re capable of better. If you want to deepen your practice, to be a more effective and self-reliant witch, and to strengthen your relationship with the Land, spirits, and Gods, I want to help you however I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo that end, I provide intense divination services via throwing the bones, have produced 100+ articles, and have recently turned my focus to writing books and courses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support provides me with a consistent income that allows me to scale back on my freelance writing clients and focus more heavily on helping people navigate the interlap between their spiritual and everyday lives, take their witchcraft deeper, and become more effective witches. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow I began Writing and Why\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the end of 2010, my husband and I created a website called The Tarot Witch. It was a small attempt to combat the growing mountain of misinformation concerning witchcraft and Paganism with weekly and, later, bi-monthly articles. Around that same time, I started blogging, sharing glimpses into my personal practice, as well as sharing with you my and my husband\u2019s experiences in raising our children Pagan and as witches and how we function as a family coven (or local family cultus if you want to get technical\u2026)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen The Tarot Witch was later shut down in 2012, the numerous articles were moved to my blog and I continued to write the bi-monthly articles as a continued effort to provide sincere and experienced based information that others could use to, hopefully, deepen their understanding of why they did things a particular way in order to strengthen their practice. I continued to write through multiple pregnancies, while juggling going to school fulltime and working fulltime, while being homeless, and even while living in the middle of the wilderness in New Mexico without power or internet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s never been about the money, which is why my website has \u003cstrong\u003ealways\u003c/strong\u003e been ad-free and I\u2019ve never once pushed affiliate links or products even when I really, \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e could have used the money. I write because I am compelled to, and I write about witchcraft because after so many years of practice I cannot imagine my life without it. The support and feedback I\u2019ve gotten from you, my treasured readers, keeps me motivated and is the entire reason I finally made the push to start writing books and, now, courses in witchcraft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere the Money Goes\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledges are used to cover the costs of hosting my website and sending monthly newsletters. This supports the writing that I am currently and have been doing for over 8 years. From there, pledges will be used to defer my meager living costs, allowing my family to continue to enjoy our wandering, wilderness lifestyle, and for me to devote most of my writing time to turning out more consistent content for \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e rather than focusing on writing for clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere is no way for me to accurately convey how much every pledge means to me. I can only hope that the higher quantity of work that I\u2019m able to produce thanks to your help serves to help people deepen their practices and to do more witchcraft when they may have otherwise made excuses.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Patreon Work\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon enables creators like me to receive predictable income each month by providing a place for fans (you) to receive extra content and exclusive rewards in exchange for a small pledge. That pledge provides a predictable income that relieves some of the stress of freelance life and allows me to focus more consistently on writing on the topics that we both love. In exchange, and depending upon how much you pledge, you will receive copies of my books, subscription to my course \u003cstrong\u003eBe a Local Witch\u003c/strong\u003e, and even monthly personalized coaching to help you with your witchcraft practice. All of this is just a small way for me to show my endless appreciation for your support and encouragement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon charges between the 1st and the 5th of each month. If you make a pledge between the 6\u0026lt;sup\u0026gt;th\u0026lt;/sup\u0026gt; and the last day of the month, you will not be charged for your pledge until the following month. If you wish to make a one-time pledge, you can pause or cancel your pledge once the charge has gone through and Patreon will no longer take payments. Please reach out to me if you have any questions on how Patreon works of if you\u2019re interested in others ways to support my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
