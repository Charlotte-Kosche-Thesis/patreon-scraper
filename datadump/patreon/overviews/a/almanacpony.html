I\u0027m not the fastest, I\u0027m not the best, but I\u0027ll always try my hardest on my books. I take commissions, do my own work, and really just try to make my mark in the fanfic world. I sincerely hope what I offer can be of interest to anyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Work Do I Do?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write Daring Do books and Fallout Equestria books, as well as several others that are commissioned series. These may be completed or added to at any given point, depending on commissions taken. ^-^\u003cbr\u003eI also make audiobooks with my works, and I hope to do more of those. They can be found on my YouTube. :)\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbSX9CEqd3xsgmq05FC3PA\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHbSX9CEqd3xsgmq0...\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere will your Money will go?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFood. :3 And treats. :3 And nice things. But... most of the time it\u0027ll go towards hardback books. With your support I can commission artists to fill the books with decent illustrations, I can pay for prototypes that will allow me to test whether or not the books are coming out decently. This will also allow me to save up, buy a load in bulk, and maybe take them to conventions at some point in the (possibly far) future. Your support will also go towards my own personal motivation, allowing me to really kick my ass into gear and churn out more pages and more works. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat Will I do for You?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to set up a Skype group specification for those that support me, either everyone that supports me or only those that support a certain amount. Through this group I will discuss ideas, book plans, you can ask questions, and through this you\u0027ll also gain access to preview of works. I\u0027ll listen to, and maybe take your advice with story directions, and those that offer me higher support may get cameo\u0027s in my stories, or mentions in story credits. :) I am also planning to make my books into hardbacks, and those that support me up to certain amounts can gain hardback books of the works that I do for free.\u003cbr\u003e"
