We use an automated data-gathering technique that allows a hands-off approach to our music listings. This affords us more time to focus on functionality and new features. All donations will help us provide a better service to the bands, venues, and music-goers. With your funding, we will focus on increasing our levels of maintenance and new development, which will offer a better experience for all users of our application. With a more specific and complete data-set, we can offer taste-making, commentary, scoring, and other facets of information that will help passionate music-seekers discover new bands. Upgrades to the \"My Calendar\" feature will help ensure that you never miss your favorite bands when they come to town.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to new development, we will also have the opportunity to upgrade our hosting resources, which will provide a faster, smoother experience on all devices when using Asheville Music Guide. For mobile users, which is an ever-increasing percentage, we do plan to make the\u00a0leap to a native iOS application in the near future, the foundation of which is already being developed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAsheville Music Guide is a large undertaking, and we have been donating our time to it as possible. We are passionate about the music-going experience in Asheville and we hope to form partnerships with businesses, non-profits, community organizations, and individuals. Since our listings are 100% automated, we will use all funding towards web and application development.\u00a0We believe that with increased accessibility to better content, the bands, venues, and community will greatly benefit. Please join us as we make new strides with this exciting technology."
