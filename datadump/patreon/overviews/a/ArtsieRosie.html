As a web designer in the past, I\u0027d have to always put my web projects on the top priority, and only work on art whenever there no projects happening. That was not only frustrating creativity wise, constantly causing the famous \"art blocks\", but it would also get my commission queue overly full, my customers would have to wait a horribly long time (think 10+ months), I\u0027d feel constantly guilty and anxious about it, etc.\u003cbr\u003eI jumped on Patreon with the intent to dedicate more to my art without feeling like it was hurting me financially. It was a pleasant surprise to figure out that, with your support, my art could not only be a part time job, it could actually be a viable carreer! It\u0027s been amazing to finally be able to pursue the kind of content and interaction I dreamed of for so long and, although I have a long way to go and much to learn, it\u0027s relieving and inspiring to be on the right track.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays I\u0027m confident to say I\u0027m an artist making a living off my work, and it\u0027s been incredibly rewarding. Patreon has really changed my life and I\u0027m the happiest I\u0027ve ever been! :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
