    "summary": "Hello! Thank You for visiting my Patreon page! \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the community\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e for being here with me, and supporting artists and their creative work! You are awesome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Annalisa. I am a 30-something artist by training, chef by trade, and cancer survivor by chance. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can get a quick intro\u003c/strong\u003e to \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/annalouisiana/posts?public=true\"\u003esome of my work here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you landed here because of the survivorship dinosaur coloring book\u003c/strong\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/page-of-as-yet-17717118\"\u003ethis is the first post I made about it\u003c/a\u003e. Turning it into something other people could color, draw on, and get healing laughs out of, is one of my first project-based goals with Patreon. All future posts and updates about the sdcb will be accessible through the \"survivorship\" tag on my posts feed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are familiar with Patreon, you can probably skip ahead to the Artist Bio.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are new to Patreon, this is how it works: When you join the Patreon community, you get access to artist creations on a subscription basis. It is similar to how we already access video thru services like nflix, etc. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere it\u0027s a little different, you can pay more for more exclusive access to specific projects/content, or what Patreon calls rewards. These are different for every creator.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a unique platform, and the payment system they currently have is also a little different and potentially confusing at first, depending on which creator you are a patron of and how they have their creator page structured. Therefore, if you\u0027re new to Patreon, it is good to familiarize yourself with it first here: \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005731463-How-do-payments-on-Patreon-work-\"\u003ehttps://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/1150...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd here: \u003ca href=\"https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\"\u003ehttps://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eArtist Bio, Background, and Rough Goals:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI grew up in Michigan and currently reside there. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making art all my life and spent about 7 years volunteering at\n a top-notch college-student run radio station. \u003cbr\u003eAs an artist, I explore many different subjects and work in a very wide range of media. \u003cbr\u003eMost of my art is illustrative, but some of it enters the realm of abstraction. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main things you can be guaranteed as a patron of my work here are weekly posts, variety, and access to exclusive content that will most likely never be seen anywhere else. Patrons also are guaranteed exclusive perks. This is mostly according to pledge tier, but you\u0027ll all pretty much be first in line for exciting news, fresh art, and sweet, sweet wearable art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI have some creative goals in mind as I work thru the Patreon number goals. \u003c/strong\u003eThese are only sort-of in chronological order, though the first few blend together as I have already started working on all of these projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to turn the dinosaur coloring book into a new coloring book \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to be able to give it away for free to patients and survivors (this is the kind of thing that only works thru others willing/able to be altruistic,) and if it ever made any kind of profit, I\u0027d rather extend that towards organizations that work directly to improve quality of life for survivors. I have two in mind for now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to get some of my paintings and illustrations printed on quality items like shirts, bags, and stickers. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to make zines about trauma and healing, and my specific survivor-ship experience/story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want those zines to be part of the scaffolding for turning my story, and advocacy about HNC, into comics. Perhaps just comics. Perhaps eventually into a graphic novel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e..More goals, y\u0027all, but I\u0027m kinda shy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you like my stuff but can\u0027t pledge, that\u0027s OK too!\u003c/strong\u003e I plan to keep adding work here set to public from time to time, as well as at tiers, so i I cannot stress this enough: I strongly dislike having to \"paywall\" my art work. However, there are a couple real and serious reasons why I feel like it\u0027s necessary to do at this time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your personal beliefs, you may appreciate helping me succeed in whatever way you are capable, because my end goals include spreading it around in my community. I have a short list of organizations in mind. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince it\u0027s early in my Patreon career, there isn\u0027t much art up for you to preview, so you might not know what to expect. Here\u0027s an idea in words: For now, as my current Patron, you will get to experience more doodles, drawings, paintings, collage, comics/cartoons, writing, mail art, poetry, matchbook art, sidewalk chalk drawings, amateur digital photography, poems (some illustrated, some not,) and eventually (as i can afford to get them printed) stickers, t-shirts, and small, hand-assembled artists books, than you will things that take specialized equipment and/or larger studio space, such as: large paintings, ceramics, silver-smithing, printmaking, large-scale paintings, welding, installation art, or analog photography.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have experience and training in many art forms, (correction: never taken a painting class) but my current access to space, materials, and equipment is very limited. I\u0027m aiming to change that. You can be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThese next few paragraphs are for you truth-seekers. If you don\u0027t like that squishy stuff, go ahead and skip forward to the part that begins \u003cem\u003e\"Alongside those serious goals...\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon\u0027s blog or whatever, tells the creator not to sound \"needy.\" But a creator is also supposed to be authentic (IMHO) and a part of that for me is Real Talk. If you wanna know where the money goes, these next couple paragraphs are some real talk. It might sound \"needy\" if you are a person who has been blessed with a lot of privilege (of which i have been. but i\u0027ve also been blessed with a lot of challenges, and they are just as real as my privilege.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA part of my early to mid-range goals is having the freedom to make art full-time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinding and maintaining employment in my post-cancer body has proven to be a huge challenge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter almost five years it\u0027s clear that 1. things are as \"better\" as they\u0027re going to get, and 2. it\u0027s still \"not good enough\" for even the most supportive and forgiving corners of capitalism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo say this is an unsustainable path is an understatement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can help me get my life back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoining me in this mini Patreon community means you have a direct impact on changing my life for the better. This means: stabilizing my income so i can pay all the bills without being exhausted and in pain all the time, find an inexpensive car safe enough to drive it 4 hours round-trip to see my onco dr, as the plan is to be checked once a year for life, and, perhaps most importantly, access much-needed medical care that isn\u0027t covered by my current insurance, and is therefore currently out of my reach: new glasses, overdue dental care, and other specialist care needed because of my treatment - for example, an RD because of the way surgery forever changed the way I eat, an endocrinologist, because I have been referred to one, and someday ideally, a physical therapist, because I have some other lasting issues from surgery and it would be nice to get some strength and mobility back in the places in my body that need it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs soon as i start moving from my second to my third goal, I will be disqualified from my current insurance, (but still most likely not able to afford a marketplace policy)\u00a0 which, if you\u0027re someone like me, managing health issues, that\u0027s a big problem. Hence: Lofty Goals, and also why i added the sponsorship and curator tiers, where Patrons have the opportunity to opt in to rewards such as cross-promotion, original art, and more leverage in giving creative direction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlongside those serious goals, are fun ones:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt might be nice to get a relatively inexpensive, quality digital camera again, not only because the picture quality of the Patreon would improve, but also because it would streamline my particular process when it comes to uploading art to the Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGenerating enough income that other forms of media are accessible to me again like they were a decade ago: I\u0027d like to get back to drawing real people, making big paintings, printmaking, forming weird pottery with faces, possibly making jewelry (sterling silver. but i have learned more about topics such as conflict around precious resources, ecology, and mining since taking those sterling classes, and i don\u0027t think i would do it now unless i could get by with recycling/repurposing old silver instead of buying it new. I digress perhaps, but that is an important detail to state.) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to be able to travel. I have about 4 cities/regions in mind. It would be nice to do something creative in each of those places, and I\u0027m pretty open to what that could be. Attending a convention, conference, bookstore reading, workshop, or other event. Collaborating. Or heck, even just making a mini-project about something about that place, just for you guys. For example, I went to the Denver Botanic once and I\u0027m pretty sure I could spend a whole week there just drawing, listening, and meditating. Or you could help me spend a few months learning new skills on a sustainable farm, which is something I have longed to do for over a decade, and have realized is only one more thing that got quite bit more challenging after treatment. Income from the Patreon helps to stabilize the inherent instability of taking those kinds of risks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMoving up through my goals would definitely mean far more content and variety on the Patreon. \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ve always been a creator. I never stop making things with my hands, taking in life, and wondering how to have a meaningful positive impact on the world around me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDespite the artwork that addresses heavy subjects, most of the rest of my work tends to be lighthearted, positive, humorous at best... meditative and relaxing at least. Or so I hope. I am honored to ask you be the judge. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*** of special note ***\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have considered making a separate Patreon to be able to show the portions of my artwork that are adult, or NSFW. I am an artist who loves figure drawing, body positivity, and making obscene doodles for fun and stress relief, and there is a significant portion of my work that reflects that but will never be seen on this patreon. I also have a growing body of work that explores topics such as ableism, white supremacy, sexual assault, rape culture, misogyny, but some of that veers into NSFW territory as well. I suppose interest and free time will dictate how fast making a separate one for all those types of work happens. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e***\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon really wants me to make a video for you guys. To be honest, I\u0027m not very experienced with video, nor do I currently have access to that kind of equipment, therefore I\u0027d rather not stumble thru and create a truly sub-par video for y\u0027all. Surely as I reach my goals I will be able to afford to bring in a rad collaborator and pay them what they are worth to make an awesome video(s) of my art work/process for us?! I have always envisioned time-lapse videos of mandala paintings, for example. That would be fun. Or you could tell me what you would most like to see in a video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease check back here from time to time as this section may change and need to be updated\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You for supporting artists here on Patreon,\u00a0 and in your communities!\u003cbr\u003e-ALB\u003cbr\u003e"
