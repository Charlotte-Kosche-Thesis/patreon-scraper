    "summary": "Support a radical new voice in film, fiction, and philosophical publishing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a teacher for my main job, but I\u0027ve also pursued artistic projects in theatre, journalism, philosophy, and literature for a few years now. Come with me on a\u00a0journey into uncharted artistic and creative territory that blends cinema, literature, and philosophy. Here are the currently ongoing projects you\u0027ll be supporting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://adamwriteseverything.blogspot.ca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAdam Writes Everything\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e: This is both a general description of what I do and the title of my blog, where I\u0027ve been discussing the daily work of writing, research, and thinking that\u0027s gone into all my creative projects since Summer 2013. This is my space to discuss all the ideas that I weave into my work \u2013 and I write it a minimum of five days each week already. So if you support my work, you\u0027ll also support the creation of new content damn near every day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe next big publishing project I\u0027m embarking on is a philosophical look at the Peter Capaldi years of Doctor Who. It will include updated versions of essays that I\u0027ve published on the blog discussing different themes and concepts as they appear in each episode from Deep Breath onward. There will be a few supplementary essays as well, with topics that I\u0027m still figuring out. If Patrons have any suggestions, those will be included too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also work with the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://syff.ca\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSyria Film Festival\u003c/a\u003e, a peace and arts organization in Toronto. Part of that work is in marketing and promotion, but most relevant to my Patreon supporters is the documentary I\u0027m co-directing with SYFF co-founder Maher Azem. With the working title \u003cem\u003eAround One Table\u003c/em\u003e, we\u0027re telling the stories of participants in Syrian Welcome Dinners, a small organization that brings together Canadian-born and Syrian newcomer families to build friendships and help people build a new life in a new country. We\u0027re working with families who have histories of human rights activism in Canada and in the Middle East, and who\u0027ve come through harrowing experiences to escape the terror of Syria\u0027s war and oppression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost posts focus on thinking through ideas that will form my next major work of non-fiction, tentatively titled \u003cem\u003eUtopias\u003c/em\u003e. A follow-up to my book on ecological philosophy and politics, Palgrave MacMillan\u0027s \u003cem\u003eEcology, Ethics, and the Future of Humanity\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eUtopias\u003c/em\u003e explores how the most effective political transformations happen \u2013 literally changing minds. I also discuss ideas and techniques in my fiction and script writing, as well as journalism work, and essays that \u003ca href=\"http://social-epistemology.com/tag/adam-riggio/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI publish at the Reply Collective\u003c/a\u003e, an open-access forum for cutting-edge philosophical research in politics and knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eYou Were My Friend\u003c/em\u003e: An independent feature-length comedy-drama film about the struggles of two roommates in a stagnant economy.\u00a0Madison spends her days working in the offices of an unsustainable sharing economy company, counting down the days until its bankruptcy. Needing a roommate to save on bills,\u00a0Vicki answers her ad and moves in. She\u0027s a part-time waitress, kicked out of her family home and cut off from the financial support she needs to continue going to college. These accidental best friends could help each other through hard times, or tear their lives apart. This project is adapted from a play of the same name I wrote in 2014 that was performed in Hamilton, Ontario.\u003cbr\u003e"
