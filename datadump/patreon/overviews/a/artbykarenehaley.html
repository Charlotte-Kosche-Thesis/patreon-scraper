I\u0027m Karen, the illustrator from the \u003cbr\u003eYouTube Channel ArtbyKarenEHaley! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m returning to Patreon to offer monthly alcohol marker lessons!\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThese lessons support my YouTube Art Channel and allow me to continue illustrating from home. Having the ability to work from home enables me to remain with my son and care for him, rather than having to hire a caregiver and find work outside the home. We all know its tough to get by, so the support you Patrons give means the world to me and to my family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBefore you pledge, please note!\u003cbr\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eIf you have a Skillshare subscription already, you currently have access to these courses. Pledging here on Patreon, while appreciated, would not be necessary for you unless you want to get the Patreon perks I offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Skillshare?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e You may have heard about it already. Its basically Netflix for creativity and learning. Your monthly subscription gives you access to all the content on the website, including lessons from myself and thousands of other creators. we get a portion of your support and you get an interactive student-teacher experience.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up using this affiliate link, you would be supporting me even more with no extra cost to you, and hey, that would be awesome for both of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why put these lessons on Patreon if they\u0027re already on Skillshare?\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eWell, because its budget friendly. Anyone who pledges 5 dollars per month will be able to access all the courses I have released. This is to offer classes to those who don\u0027t have the budget for a Skillshare account, which is an annual fee of 99$ per year or 15$ per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThere are several upsides to being a Patreon pledger!\u003cbr\u003eIn the 1 dollar tier:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ethis pledge is a tip jar, and would be a great place to pledge if you are already a skillshare student that wants to give some extra support. You will get to see sneak peeks as I create the upcoming lessons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the 5 dollar tier:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get access to the sneak peeks.\u003cbr\u003eYou save money compared to the price of a Skillshare subscription.\u003cbr\u003eYour pledge provides more support than a Skillshare subscription- about $4.50 goes to me rather than just under $2.00. (which is still not bad).\u003cbr\u003eYou join a unique community of students that gets one on one interaction with me! \u003cbr\u003eAs you share your class assignments I give you advice and critiques to help you improve your work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn the 10 dollar tier:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou get access to the previous rewards.\u003cbr\u003e as a Patron \u003cstrong\u003ewill have a say in the subjects of future courses\u003c/strong\u003e. Yes, that\u0027s right! If you need to know how to color something with your markers, you can request a lesson on the subject and I will focus an upcoming lesson around it.\u003cbr\u003eYou will get access to \u003cstrong\u003eLIVE bi-monthly Q and A sessions via Google Hangout\u003c/strong\u003e, a morning session and a night session.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAre there downsides?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe downside is that with this patreon pledge you won\u0027t get access to the lessons of the other creators on Skillshare. Trust me, there are loads of new skills to learn just waiting for you. If you have the budget for Skillshare, but still want to give me extra support, I recommend using this affiliate link.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI can\u0027t afford to support you but want access to your courses! What can I do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can get access to one month of skillshare courses for free if you sign up for premium membership. After that first month you can cancel your subscription. \u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately the amount of hours (typically 40 or more) that go in to making lessons means that giving completely free access to them would be unreasonable. Please remember that this is how I make my living. The amount the pledges are set at are as low as I will go.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m unable to sign up but I want to help you! How can I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSharing my Patreon, Storenvy, Redbubble, Skillshare, watching and subscribing to my YouTube Channel, and other Social Media Platforms are all excellent ways to help support me, even if you are unable to offer monetary contributions. If one of your friends likes my work they might be able to support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/oxVaxW_nB_s\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e"
