And for that alone, I thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe first time I posted a comic page on DeviantART back in 2008, I felt like the happiest girl on Earth. I didn\u0027t really know what I was doing, and the comic didn\u0027t have as many readers back in the day, but from that instant, I knew that \u003cem\u003ethis was exactly what I wanted to do for a career\u003c/em\u003e. Each comic page is immensely gratifying for me, and to know that there are people out there who are gratified by my work in the same way feels simply too good to pass up. I was lucky enough to have gathered a number of readers from all over the world, and their support is exactly what keeps me going today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, very rightly, you wonder: \"Why do you need a Patreon then?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe answer is very simple.\u003cbr\u003eAs much as I love making comics, there has been a point in time in which I had to make a choice for my future. Choosing the right University study field is never easy. My first thought was, of course, to go to Art Academy. But sadly, I live in a country which, despite its iconic artistic background, is currently engaged in a seemingly never-ending fundraising, and looks down on any job that doesn\u0027t involve business companies. Freelance creators have a very, \u003cem\u003every\u003c/em\u003e hard time here, especially young ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s why I opted for Pharmacy at University. It was my \"backup plan\", and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed studying it. However, no matter what I did or how many hours I committed myself to this new course, I just couldn\u0027t stop drawing. I\u0027ve been in the School of Pharmacy for five years, and I\u0027ve produced more comic pages during this period than ever in my entire life. And what\u0027s worse, is that I was never able to consider it a hobby, or a part-time activity. It was, to all intents and purposes, a second job, and I just couldn\u0027t stand the fact that it was \"second\", because I knew I enjoyed it way more than the \"first\". Time and time again I\u0027ve been thinking of changing course and doing what I really love doing. But I couldn\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe final straw came during my journey to Nottingham, UK, between July and October 2015. My University sent me there in order for me to work in a pharmacy lab and write my thesis.\u003cbr\u003eNow, if this was super exciting at first, as time passed, I\u0027ve also had some awful experiences and underwent mild depression and emotional breakdown. I told myself over and over that this wasn\u0027t what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and this mere thought made my stomach twist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, with graduation behind me, it\u0027s time to look for a job. Not an ordinary job, mind you: what I really, really want to do is to keep up with my projects, to make a job out of my art.\u003cbr\u003eAnd this is exactly where you guys can help, and make a difference in my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat, when and how\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBy supporting me on Patreon, \u003cem\u003eyou are giving me the chance of working on my comics full time\u003c/em\u003e. This is not only my goal here on this site, but my goal in life, too. You\u0027re probably sick of hearing it already, but I love drawing comics, and to be able to make them full time would be a dream come true, and the best dream ever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd working full time means more frequent updates! What I aim to is to bring you \u003cem\u003eboth my comics once a week\u003c/em\u003e. And in the meantime, I would shower you with tons of content and personalized rewards for your awesome and constant support, every month.\u003cbr\u003eAs the support increases, I will be able to bring even more content to Patreon, finally print my \u003cem\u003eAfrica\u003c/em\u003e comic, and why not, do a couple more things that have been in the back of my mind for a while, and that I\u0027ve finally decided to make public ;)\u003cbr\u003eYou choose the amount of money to donate, and I will do all the rest.\u003cbr\u003eAnd if the goal is reached, you will know that you made the life of one person complete.\u003cbr\u003eIf the goal is reached, you will know what it feels like to be a guardian angel. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, you will provide Rothwer with his daily dose of apples. Which is equally gratifying. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig01.deviantart.net/72b1/f/2015/356/f/0/why_can_t_i_hold_all_these_apples_by_arven92-d9l22k6.png\" style=\"text-align: left; width: 265px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
