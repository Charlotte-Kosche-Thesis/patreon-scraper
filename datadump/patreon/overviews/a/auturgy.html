     "about": "Hello and welcome to my Patreon page; my name is Michael Tangen. \u00a0Let me tell you a little bit about my music project, Auturgy. The word \u003cem\u003eauturgy\u003c/em\u003e has become long-forgotten in the English language \u2014 a term that means \"self-action, or independent activity\". For a number of years I \n\t\t\t\t\t\thave operated under the pseudonym \u003ca href=\"http://music.michaelmiles.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMichael Miles\u003c/a\u003e, but as of late I have had a stirring within me to start over, to \n\t\t\t\t\t\tdo something fresh and a bit bigger than I\u0027ve ever set out to do before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAUTURGY is a musical project that I\u0027ve put together for self-expression, both creating covers of artists that have long been influential in my music, as well as writing and recording \n\t\t\t\t\t\tsome brand new originals and leaving the old ones behind. When you hear my music, you\u0027ll hear clear rock tones, larger-than-life etherial soundscapes, a driving rhythm section, and \n\t\t\t\t\t\tvocals with a vast spectrum of intensity and color. At this time you won\u0027t see or hear the presence of any additional band members, but from time to time I will likely bring in some \n\t\t\t\t\t\tguest musicians to sit in with me and make some music together. Their presence will be duly noted with their credits and appearances in the YouTube videos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe format is pretty simple, really. I create music and videos of every song that\u0027s created, post them on YouTube, BandCamp, SoundCloud, and all the other social media outlets linked to \n\t\t\t\t\t\ton my site.  If you like what you hear, all I ask is that you share it with your friends. If you really like it, please either buy my music or become a \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/auturgy\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePatron\u003c/a\u003e and support me with a buck per song/video released. \u003cbr\u003e",
