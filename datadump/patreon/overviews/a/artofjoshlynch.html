    "summary": "Hello! My name is Josh Lynch and I am a Senior Texture Artist with over 7 years of industry experience. I have been fortunate to contribute to multiple AAA projects including Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, and Defiance.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very passionate about teaching and mentoring fellow artists. Recently, I have had the opportunity to give live demonstrations at Gnomon, GDC, and SIGGRAPH. As well, I have created online video tutorials focused on PBR material creation. Head on over to my ArtStation page to check out my personal and professional work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy email is\u00a0josh.a.lynch@gmail.com.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Doing This Mentorship?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are a couple of reasons I wanted to set up this Patreon. The first reason is that I love teaching and sharing with fellow artists. The second is that I am passionate about PBR material creation and I want to share that passion with you and help you grow in this discipline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to help artists grow their texture creation skills, critical eye for detail, and help put some story and character into the textures being created. I want to help you present your materials in a professional manner and help you with building your branding and web presence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho Is This Mentorship For?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am open to working with student, junior artists, or experienced industry artists. The main thing is that this mentorship is for motivated artists who are looking to improve their texture creation skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis mentorship is not for artists who are just opening up Photoshop, ZBrush, Substance Designer, etc. In other words, this is not a class or tutorial and you should already be creating art already. This is for artists who are skilled in content creation and are looking guidance in pushing themselves and their art forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am very excited to meet you and help you grow, but you will only get out of this what you want to put into it. If you don\u2019t do any art for a week and have nothing for me to give feedback on, that is on you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Can We Focus On?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of this month long mentorship you will have access to a Senior Texture Artist who is not only passionate about texture creation but is passionate about seeing you grow as an artist. Ultimately it is up to you what you want to focus on over this month long mentorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you looking to create a material from scratch? Do you have an existing material you want to improve? Are you looking for advice on lighting and presentation? Are you looking for advice on branding and web presence?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe can focus entirely on one of those aspects or a mix of a little bit of everything. It is entirely up to you, but whatever you choose I am excited to help you grow in that area!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow will it go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause this mentorship is for one month it is important that we maximize our time together. Please reach out to me via email so we can discuss your goals and go over any questions you may have and discuss what you want to get out of this mentorship.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach week you will submit an update and I will talk to you about what you are working on and provide you with one-on-one guidance via online communication, paint overs, and notes."
