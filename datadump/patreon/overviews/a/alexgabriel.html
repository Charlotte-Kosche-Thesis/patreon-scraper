I\u2019m hugely grateful to the people who support me here, and if you\u2019re reading this, you might be thinking about doing that. Here\u2019s everything you need to know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn case you just found me:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write regularly, mostly on \u003ca href=\"http://www.medium.com/@alexgabriel\"\u003eMedium\u003c/a\u003e but sometimes for other places. (I\u2019m also experimenting with photos and illustration.) My posts are about everything\u2014politics, art, abuse, mental illness, film and TV, religion, writing, queer identity\u2014and they\u2019re listed here and at the link above.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2015, I\u2019ve been without anywhere to live; after a year of depression and writer\u2019s block, publishing frequently with Patreon has helped me both financially and mentally. Being homeless is expensive, and what I now earn from writing makes finding meals and hostels easier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the upsides of my life right now is that I get to be mobile. From April 2017, I\u2019ll be backpacking in Berlin and writing a travel series about Brexit, austerity and the far right, paying my way with daily posts. Keep up with the series by subscribing to \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/goodbye-to-berlin/homeless-journalism-in-the-age-of-brexit-943a36f362f8\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoodbye to Berlin\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e on Medium.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow being a patron works\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you want to sign up, here\u2019s what to do\u2014and thanks. It means a lot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u2014Click \u2018Become a patron\u2019 and pledge an amount of your choice per post.\u003cbr\u003e\u2014Set a monthly limit so you never get billed more than you can afford.\u003cbr\u003e\u2014Select any rewards you want to claim. Details are on this page.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor example, if you pledge $3 per post up to $15 per month, you\u2019ll stop being charged if I write more than five posts. (You don\u2019t have to enter a maximum, but since I\u2019m always trying to post more, it\u2019s a good move!) Patrons are charged at the start of the month, and payment is automatic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOther ways you can help\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you want to support me but Patreon isn\u2019t right, there are other ways to back what I do. Firstly, come \u003ca href=\"http://medium.com/@alexgabriel\"\u003efollow me\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/goodbye-to-berlin/homeless-journalism-in-the-age-of-brexit-943a36f362f8\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eGoodbye to Berlin\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e on Medium. The more readers I have, the more help I get from the site algorithms, and the more motivation I have to keep publishing. (You can also \u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/alexgabriel\"\u003efollow me on Twitter\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly: I\u2019m hostelling in Berlin because I have nowhere to live, and because it\u2019s cheaper than in England. Right now that\u2019s where my writing income is going, but this summer I\u2019ll be looking for my own place. To do that I\u2019ll need to have had a healthy bank balance at least three months, so I\u2019m holding a housing fundraiser on \u003ca href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/help-house-a-homeless-writer\"\u003eGoFundMe\u003c/a\u003e. If instead of becoming a patron, you want to make a one-time donation, that\u2019s a good place\u2014and again, it would mean a lot. For full details, see the page.\u003cbr\u003e"
