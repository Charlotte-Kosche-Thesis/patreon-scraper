    "summary": "\u003ca href=\"https://adventuregamers.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAdventure Gamers\u003c/a\u003e\u00a0started as a humble fan site in 1998 but grew into one of the premier online\u00a0magazines of its kind and the largest English-language website devoted to the\u00a0adventure genre. We specialize in covering computer and video games that focus on puzzle\u00a0solving within a narrative framework, from the oldest text and graphic adventures (such as \u003cem\u003eZork\u003c/em\u003e,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eKing\u2019s Quest\u003c/em\u003e, and \u003cem\u003eMonkey Island\u003c/em\u003e) up through today\u2019s most recent releases (such as \u003cem\u003eThimbleweed Park, Kathy Rain \u003c/em\u003eand\u003cem\u003e Samoros\u003c/em\u003et). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith an audience of over 100,000 unique visitors every month, our goal is to be \u003cem\u003ethe\u003c/em\u003e trusted source for all international game news, previews, and reviews,\u00a0interviews with people involved in adventure game development, and feature coverage of\u00a0industry events such as the Game Developers Conference, E3, and gamescom. Our active\u00a0forums are home to a large community of adventure gamers from all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe\u0027ve been around for almost 20 years and want to be around for much longer, but if we\u2019re to\u00a0evolve, innovate, and continue to thrive in these challenging times for online magazines, we\u2019re\u00a0going to need your help.\u00a0We don\u2019t plan to reinvent the wheel, merely improve where\u00a0we can and expand in exciting new ways, whether it\u2019s providing extensive coverage in new\u00a0formats like video, increasing the efficiency with which we can cover new game releases, or\u00a0even exploring whether we can turn this into an actual physical magazine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are lots of ways we know we can be better, but upgrading costs money we simply don\u2019t\u00a0have. Our website design is quite outdated, as is our forum software, and we\u0027re looking to\u00a0provide options for readers to support us in our efforts to make Adventure Gamers a home for passionate genre fans that is going to be around for decades to come. Being privately funded unfortunately means that we are currently running at\u00a0a loss each month, which limits our abilities in what we can deliver. Having an actual budget to\u00a0work with will not only help us maintain daily operations\u00a0but to keep looking ahead, allowing us to redesign the\u00a0site, pursue physical magazine options, purchase proper video equipment for (regular)\u00a0interviews, look into a mobile app, create a physical Aggies statuette, visit more events and much more. It\u0027s our\u00a0dream to one day be able to work on Adventure Gamers full-time, instead of it being a side-project right now, largely driven by a team of passionate volunteers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdventure games tell us stories, present us with puzzles to solve, and give us new worlds to\u00a0explore that we could otherwise only imagine. We want to share our passion for such\u00a0experiences not only with like-minded gamers, but also introduce others who aren\u0027t aware of\u00a0adventure games to this genre we all hold so dear. We can\u2019t do this without you, so please\u00a0consider supporting us. Along with the satisfaction of knowing that your pledge is making an important\u00a0difference to the welfare of the site, we\u2019ll provide a number of tangible benefits offered only to\u00a0those making a monthly commitment, which we believe will make your Adventure Gamers\u00a0experience even more rewarding.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe don\u2019t like asking for money, and we wish we could go on being completely self-sufficient,\u00a0but the time has come to admit that we can\u2019t. Hopefully our reputation of honesty and integrity\u00a0speaks for itself, but rest assured that every dollar donated will be channeled into the operation\u00a0and advancement of the site, a goal that benefits everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe truly believe that a healthy Adventure Gamers contributes to a healthy adventure genre. The\u00a0success of any niche market is dependent on a dedicated grassroots community keeping the\u00a0faith. We\u2019ve been doing just that for nearly two decades now, and during that time the\u00a0genre has emerged from\u00a0its oft-proclaimed \u201cdeath\u201d throes to being flourishing at an\u00a0unprecedented level of independent\u00a0development. With your help, we can continue to lead the way in providing ongoing coverage of\u00a0this genre resurgence, but there\u2019s only one way that can happen: \u003cem\u003etogether\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e"
