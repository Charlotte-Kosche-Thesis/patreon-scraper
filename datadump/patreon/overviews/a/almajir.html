I\u0027ve been writing online about my football club Birmingham City and it\u0027s ownership travails since 2011. I have two websites -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.oftenpartisan.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eOften Partisan\u003c/a\u003e (which I retired in 2016) and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.almajir.net\"\u003ealmajir.net\u003c/a\u003e, and a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Haircuts-League-Cups-Carson-Yeung/dp/0992954908\"\u003ebook co-written with top Hong Kong solicitor Will Giles\u003c/a\u003e about the club. I survived five legal threats and was eventually a key part in hated club \"acting chairman\" Peter Pannu being forced out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWriting online is a job for me - but alas my job doesn\u0027t allow me to do what I really want to do. My club might have got rid of Yeung and Pannu but that doesn\u0027t mean the time for vigilance is over - the new titular owner has never been photographed online and there are rumours of shadowy businessmen taking control too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not just my own club either. All four of the football clubs in the West Midlands are now owned by Chinese businesses. It\u0027s very difficult to get information about these owners and what they are trying to do and as one of the few people in the UK media to get to grips with the Carson affair I think I have a lot to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith support from patrons, I can devote more time to investigating things. With extra resources it\u0027s possible to obtain documents and information that might not be ordinarily available - even if it means going to source. I\u0027m not looking for fame or fortune - more the chance to prove to myself that people value my work and to prove to everyone else that with a bit of backing, much is possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot only that, but with support from patrons it\u0027s easier for me to share my findings. The internet has come a long way since I launched Often Partisan with things like video hangouts increasingly popular. The more support I have, the more time I can spend responding to people and answering questions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making plans to write a second book, and as part of those plans I want to use Patreon to share the process. Rather than just ask people to put up money to receive a book in the future, I like the idea of people contributing a small amount and become a part of the whole project.\u003cbr\u003e"
