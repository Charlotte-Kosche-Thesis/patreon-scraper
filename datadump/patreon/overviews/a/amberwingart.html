While my animals look like the animals in our world, the world that I have created for them is one of safety and innocence. As a result, the animals that my artwork captures often\u00a0find themselves in situations and circumstances that they wouldn\u0027t in the harsh reality of our world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope my work gives people a deeper appreciation for and connection to the living beings around them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0My work has been collected in the US, Canada, and Europe.
