Below, I explain what patreon is, why I\u0027m doing it and how you can be a part of it. If we\u0027ve never met, please allow me introduce myself...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is a patreon page? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a\u00a0place where I can share my creations with my community while getting paid doing so. \u003cem\u003e(this might be the shortest explanation I\u0027ve had of anything ever)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! My name is Ashley Monical and I love writing. I have been writing songs, blogs and poetry for over a decade. I have a significant following on social media (and my blog) where I have always shared these creations. I LOVE to create. It brings so much joy to my spirit when I get to share it with you! It is incredible to receive positive feedback and connection from those who read my stuff, AND I\u0027ve gotta have an income to feed (literally and figuratively) what I love to do most!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never identified with the phrase \"starving artist.\" It doesn\u0027t sit well with me. I am a firm believer in abundance (in whatever form it takes) for everyone, especially if we are living from our hearts. I am very blessed to get to do what I love for a living. I look at my artistry as collaboration because when I share what I write, I get so much back from the people who read/hear it. It\u0027s like an, \"if a tree falls in the forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?\" type of thing. It creates a flow of inspiration for all involved and THAT is what life is all about! YES!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I write about?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI write about my life experience, relationships, self-love, courage, the unknown, spirituality, sobriety, authenticity and really any topic that comes pouring into the crown of my head and wells up inside of me until I start typing on the keys or connect the pen to the paper. You will likely find encouragement through my writings. They typically have a healthy dose of story and inspiration sprinkled at least a little humor. We all need more of the humor stuff!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little more about me in a few sentences... I was born in 1985. I have been sober since 2012. I used to be a touring singer-songwriter. I stopped performing at the end of 2015 because I was experiencing panic attacks on stage which led to depression. I got help (something I share about through a lot of my writing). I now do work in drug \u0026amp; alcohol treatment centers, running group workshops focusing on guided meditation, yoga, song healing and education on spirituality, self love and authenticity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the exchange here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn joining this community (tribe!), you will have access to the writings I share. Because I\u0027m not a fortune teller, I am not able to predict when a creation will flow through. It is never my intention to force this mystery. As a member of the tribe, you can choose what you would like to contribute for each writing I release. I\u0027ve always committed to sharing creations that serve the greatest good through my raw, honest self.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose $5 per writing and I put out 3 writings in a month, you will be contributing $15 a month (obviously I\u0027m really good at math). You can always change this to meet your comfortability too! I plan do create anywhere from 3 - 6 pieces a month (but this is subject to change depending on, well, me).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMoney is energy that reflects our time, effort and talents... However we spend our money is a reflection of our own self worth. My hope is that my enthusiasm for writing lends to your own personal growth in however that looks for your unique journey through this space/time continuum!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*I share the beginning of all writing pieces publicly on my social media and website blog. In order to read the rest of each piece, one will need to join this community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThank you so much for joining the tribe! I am really looking forward to continuing this journey with you! Your commitment to me is greeted with my commitment to creating, and for that, I am humbly grateful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSide note: one day I would love to write a book. Perhaps this conjoining of our powerful forces will be an integral part of that manifestation.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and blessings!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAshley\u003cbr\u003e"
