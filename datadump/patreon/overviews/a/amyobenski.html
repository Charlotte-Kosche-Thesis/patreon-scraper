     "about": "With a stark and hon\u00adest inten\u00adsity, Amy Obenski\u2019s rich, crys\u00adtalline voice cuts through the noise of every day life. She\u2019s a Cal\u00adi\u00adfor\u00adnia native. Raised in San Diego and now based in San Fran\u00adcisco, the sound of the far west is unmis\u00adtak\u00adably infused into her words and sound. She\u2019s toured the West Coast for ten years and even got her song \u201cCarousel\u201d into the Hol\u00adly\u00adwood scene when it was placed on the TV Show, Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2011 Amy went to Europe for the first time with a mind open to sur\u00adprises. This is where she met The Car\u00adbone Band from Nantes, France. They had a prac\u00adtice and two con\u00adcerts that week. The music was a col\u00adli\u00adsion of Amy\u2019s free \u201cCal\u00adi\u00adfor\u00adnia girl\u201d sound and the French\u2019s deep pas\u00adsion and inten\u00adsity. Their per\u00adson\u00adal\u00adi\u00adties and musi\u00adcal\u00adity imme\u00addi\u00adately clicked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwo days after her return to Cal\u00adi\u00adfor\u00adnia, Amy decided she was going back to France. She planned a four-month tour across the United States, the U.K. and France, where she reunited with The Car\u00adbone Band. They played sev\u00aderal con\u00adcerts and the music grew and became intensely pas\u00adsion\u00adate, grounded rock that sways as if float\u00ading on the breeze.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2013, Amy returned again and spent three months with The Car\u00adbone Band. They recorded an album and were artist in res\u00adi\u00addence at La Mai\u00adson des Arts in Saint Herblain. Her fifth album, Rest\u00adless, released in sum\u00admer of 2014. Rest\u00adless fea\u00adtures the dis\u00adtinc\u00adtive sound of The Car\u00adbone Band and also a string ensem\u00adble of stu\u00addents and asso\u00adciates of La Mai\u00adson des Arts. The Car\u00adbone Band is com\u00adprised of Philippe Cro\u00adchet on gui\u00adtar, Jos\u00adselin Sebille on bass and Mourad A\u00eft Abdel\u00admalek on the drums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmy\u2019s musi\u00adcal his\u00adtory stretches back to age five, when she began singing in her school choir. She took up piano at age six and has been study\u00ading music ever since. She finally picked up the gui\u00adtar when she began song\u00adwrit\u00ading at twenty-two.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn Santa Cruz, Cal\u00adi\u00adfor\u00adnia, she sup\u00adported local orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions through a series of ben\u00ade\u00adfit con\u00adcerts called Take Back Your For\u00adest. Col\u00adlec\u00adtively they raised six thou\u00adsand dol\u00adlars for the Sem\u00adper\u00advirens Fund, an orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtion that pur\u00adchases and pro\u00adtects red\u00adwood for\u00adest in the Santa Cruz Moun\u00adtains. She con\u00adtin\u00adues to sup\u00adport these types of orga\u00adni\u00adza\u00adtions as much as pos\u00adsi\u00adble. In 2012, her Car\u00adbon Con\u00adscious Tour raised aware\u00adness about the effects on cli\u00admate change from burn\u00ading rain\u00adfor\u00adest in South America.\u003cbr\u003e",
