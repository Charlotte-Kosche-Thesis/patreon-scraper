Until such time, however, we continue to work hard, releasing new screenshots weekly and a new in-game movie monthly. \u00a0Each and every time we pledge to demonstrate measurable forward progress, so you can see the results of our efforts. \u00a0Your support will go directly to the team, as well as hardware, software, and hosting costs. \u00a0Thank you for helping us make this dream a reality."

     "about": "Brad McQuaid has been involved in games development for over 15 years.  He was the original producer and co-designer of EverQuest, managing the development team from the project\u0027s inception until its launch. He then assumed the role of executive producer for the first few EverQuest expansions.  He also was a founder of Verant Interactive and its Vice President. After Verant\u0027s acquisition by Sony Online Entertainment, Brad served there as Vice President of Premium Games responsible for EverQuest, EverQuest 2, EverQuest Online Adventures, PlanetSide, and Star Wars: Galaxies. In addition, Brad was the company\u0027s Chief Creative Officer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter leaving SOE in October 2001, Brad took a short break and then co-founded Sigil Games Online.  There he took on the role of CEO and co-executive-producer.  The company began development of the massively multiplayer Vanguard: Saga of Heroes.  They made a development deal first with Microsoft and then later with Sony Online Entertainment. Over the next five years Sigil grew to over 100 employees and in January of 2007, Sigil and SOE launched Vanguard:  Saga of Heroes.  Later that year Sigil sold both the company and Vanguard to Sony Online Entertainment.After the sale, Brad decided to take an extended break from games development to pursue is his hobbies and to spend time with friends and family. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrad next co-founded in May of 2010 a new start-up in the San Diego area. The new game studio focused on next generation sophisticated casual and social games.  Unable to find the right amount of funding, but learning a lot about free-to-play gaming, Brad left the start-up in January 2012.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn February of 2012, Brad received an offer from John Smedley to return to SOE and work on a Vanguard re-launch.  Extremely excited that Vanguard was going to receive another chance at success, Brad accepted the offer and joined the team as a Senior Game Designer.  After a year on Vanguard, where he helped make the game F2P and revamped a number of regions, he was offered a position on EverQuest 1.  Excited about the opportunity to return to another title he was involved with, he accepted the role as EQ Senior Gamer Designer in February 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBrad left SOE in August 2013 as part of a huge RIF.  With so many jobless developers in the area and so many exciting game design ideas in his head, Brad formed a new company, Visionary Realms, in September 2013.  They immediately began development of a new, classic, challenging, group-focused MMO called Pantheon: Rise of the Fallen.  Visionary Realms has launched a comprehensive web site that also supports crowdfunding.  Brad has assumed the role of Chief Creative Officer at Visionary Realms and is also one of the Producers of Pantheon.\u003cbr\u003e",
