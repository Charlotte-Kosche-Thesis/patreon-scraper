    "summary": "I am Amber Galloway Gallego, the Music sign language interpreter. \u00a0Many people know me for the viral video of Kendrick Lamar\u0027s F@%king Problems, soon after that video surfaced I was featured on Jimmy Kimmel\u0027s Sign Language Rap Battle, Rollingstone, Vibe Magazine, Oprah Magazine and several online news programs. I have set Patreon up as a means of finanical support so that I can continue in the amazing journey of making music covers accessible. I have been an interpreter for over 17 years now. I was taught and made by the Deaf community. I am now very well rooted and firmly planted in the Deaf community as well as in the culture since my spell in 2002 of meningitis which has caused me to also have significant hearing loss. I am considered to now be Hard of Hearing. I was born hearing to hearing parents but luckily I had significant Deaf stars lead my way to my current journey and world. I am 100 percent dedicated to the fight for language and access equality. \u00a0I  have my Master\u0027s Degree in ASL/English Interpreting. My certifications are National Certification RID CT\u0026amp;CI, NIC, Texas BEI Level V, Oral Certified: Comprehensive. I CANNOT THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR SUPPORT TO ENSURE MUSIC IS ACCESSIBLE TO ALL!"
