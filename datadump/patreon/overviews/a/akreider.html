    "summary": "My name is Anna Kreider, and I\u0027m a game designer, illustrator, and writer. Mostly what I write these days are\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://peachpantspress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eroleplaying games\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://gomakemeasandwich.wordpress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eblog posts\u003c/a\u003e, but my first love was and always will be writing fiction. I desperately miss writing fiction, and would like to get back into it - but I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe goal of this project is to write a novel, albeit one that will be written and released a chapter at a time. I\u0027m hoping that I can attract enough support to make this a financially viable prospect.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProject Details\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn From the Cold is a novel that I have been planning for the last few months, based on a long-running tabletop campaign of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://apocalypse-world.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eApocalypse World\u003c/a\u003e set in the Canadian arctic - albeit with many liberties taken and changes made for the needs of a different format. While it\u0027s hard for me to precisely predict length, my target for average chapter length is 4-5000 words, and the story itself will take place over 14-16 chapters. My goal is to publish chapters approximately once per month.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://infromthecoldfiction.wordpress.com/2015/04/13/hello-world/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can read the first chapter for free here\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuality is something I take very seriously for this project. This novel has been meticulously planned; my detailed, annotated outline is just over 10,000 words. I also have an experienced editor on board who will be helping me do final rewrites on content before it is published to my patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also am committed to making each chapter an entertaining experience. Infodump chapters are one of genre fiction\u0027s cardinal sins, and I have put the work into planning to make sure that \u003cem\u003ethis doesn\u0027t happen\u003c/em\u003e. Each chapter will be able to stand on its own merits in terms of entertainment value. That is something I take very, very seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(\u003cstrong\u003eWait, go back. You mean this is fanfic?)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eTechnically speaking, yes? Though I certainly don\u0027t see that as a bad thing! Some of the most famous series in Fantasy started out as fanfic based on a tabletop roleplaying campaign - Terry Brooks\u0027 Shannara series and the Dragonlance Chronicles by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman being two very notable examples. Roleplaying has long been a rich and fruitful source of inspiration for writers of genre fiction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Do I Know This Will Be Worth Reading?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI have been writing seriously for nearly twenty years, but perhaps more importantly: I\u0027m an experienced writer with a lot of professional writing and publishing credits. I\u0027ve done freelance writing and design for various roleplaying publishers, including Onyx Path. I\u0027ve also been publishing my own games since 2008 through my games company Peach Pants Press and have done well enough that I\u0027ve funded two game-related crowdfunding projects.\u00a0Lastly, for more than a year now I\u0027ve been running a Patreon for my feminist gaming blog: Go Make Me a Sandwich. Through that Patreon I\u0027ve published more than fifty paid posts as well as a semi-regular stream of unpaid content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short,\u00a0I have the experience, ability, and discipline to commit to large creative projects and see them through to completion while still maintaining high levels of quality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027m not asking you to take this on faith. So the first chapter of In From The Cold is being\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/creation?hid=2145131\"\u003eposted freely here as a creation\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Do I Know if This Isn\u0027t For Me?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn From the Cold is explicitly a work of genre fiction, straddling the messy line between sci-fi and weird post-apocalyptic-future-fantasy. There is also cursing, and damaged, complicated people trying to make tough decisions while retaining their humanity. Lastly, this story pretty explicitly features gender fuckery. So if genre fiction, post-apocalypses, cursing, or queer characters aren\u0027t you thing? Maybe this isn\u0027t the project for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut if, on the other hand, you love post apocalypses and genre fiction and would love to read about grey morality in the post-apocalypse with a side of gender queerness? Then I think I\u0027ve got you covered.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you for your support!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
