My work is for the women of our culture. The queens of our generations past and present. For those cast aside and undermined at every turn by society to give you a sense of beauty otherwise overlooked but at the same time appropriated. \u003cbr\u003eI create and replicate this beauty of yours. The sense of capturing you as beautiful as you are and ensnaring the emotion and expression of your daily struggle with hopes of embedding you with a sense of pride in your hair, skin, and curves. That pride of an educated woman filled with the understanding that our history goes beyond what they teach us in schools. The understanding of your royal ancestry and the knowledge that we were more than slaves. Our roots deeper than the purples and greens of your skin. And souls as rich as crimsons. \u003cbr\u003eThese pieces are a testament to the woman who has struggled and worked twice as hard to solidify herself in society. I thank you for being our support system. Our mothers who birth us, our sisters, our wives.\u003cbr\u003eThis is for you. The roses that do not wither or die and only grow more vibrant with age. The wild sunflower--growing in concrete jungles constantly reaching for the sun. You are the bee that does not fit in, the worker bee that does not stop moving, and the queen bee that guides us all. I want you to see your metamorphosis. The African butterfly in all its allure. The delicate and coveted wings you use to maneuver through a white washed world.  I present to you the strength you hold inside. The strength to continue living after heartbreak. The bravery of trusting again and the determination to never allow us to fail. \u003cbr\u003eYou, queen, hold the wisdom needed to move us forward: my educator, my tutor, and my mentor. I look to you for guidance when my mind is cluttered. I look to you when my doubts won\u0027t let me decide. You are my muse. My biggest critic. My audience. \u003cbr\u003eI do this for you in hopes that you love what my hands create, in hopes that I paint your essence. From skin tones to hair texture, I continue to strive for greatness in your eyes. I capture your expression so you can relate and have a sense of familiarity with my work. The look in your eyes. The subtle sense of confidence when others see no expression. \u003cbr\u003e I present to you, you as seen by a man who worships, adores, and genuinely cares. An artist who sees your daily struggles in the workplace, on overlooked raises. I see how they take your style yet consider you less.  I witness men undervalue you. I see your adversity. I see the challenges you face. I see you radiate through it all. \u003cbr\u003eI was raised by you. I was taught by you. I was saved by you. I love you. \u003cbr\u003eThis is my statement. \u003cbr\u003eMy art is for my Black Queen.\u003cbr\u003e"
