    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHey, everyone! Welcome to my Patreon page.\u003c/strong\u003e This may be a little different than what you\u0027re used to seeing from me. So, keep that in mind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d1a0n9gptf7ayu.cloudfront.net/cache/40/b1/40b1bf882555cdf982d1f2a1aa073bf7.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBefore there were any photos to speak of, and long before I was so much as removing a shoe, \u003cem\u003eI was writing\u003c/em\u003e. Actually, technically, photos have existed since the early 1800s, and I probably removed my own shoe accidentally years before I could write. Stop being so nit-picky. ;]\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve amassed ten or so physical journals, but then also digital entries both on- and off-line numbering in the hundreds or into the thousands, by now. That\u0027s not impressive, by now, so much as it\u0027s just a symptom of getting older in the digital age, and having a very strange life. I didn\u0027t, however, have any clue how things would pan out as I wrote them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still don\u0027t, I suppose. But I continue. And I continue to be intrigued and caught off guard by my own story, so I suppose that\u0027s a positive.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have pushed this off for years, partially because I never thought anyone would have interest in what I had to say. At all. After my last three years in Florida, though, and the ways the plot has curved, plunged, seemed to disappear, thickened, I feel that I have to at least try for myself. The other reason was just the sheer magnitude of starting something I\u0027ve never done before. I struggle to begin the weekly article review I have to do for my international relations class, and that\u0027s a single paragraph. And, I mean, I \u003cem\u003estruggle \u003c/em\u003eto begin. So, how was I to sit and write a book?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created this Patreon some number of months ago, and it took maybe six months of zero activity before I put a word down. If you\u0027re contributing and cheering me on, understand that I\u0027m on the other side of the keyboard, muscles tense, probably fingers wrapped through my hair, stressing. But that I\u0027m incredibly thankful.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePart of what motivates me\u003c/strong\u003e is JUST the act of sharing my work, of hitting \"submit\" and then hearing back from people who enjoy it, or derive some kind of meaning or motivation from it. And part of what stalls me is feeling that I\u0027m just working in a vacuum, and also working against a clock, while I\u0027m also juggling a full work schedule, and school. While I feel that this is absolutely a worthwhile project, .. the \"worthwhile\" part will mostly come when I can actually close the last chapter, feel that it is whole, that I am happy, and that I can kind of throw it out into the world and see if anyone cares. Until then, I feel that I am just .. shifting papers around in the dark, and ignoring other things that I should be doing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor instance, a little about me [and somewhat related]: \u003c/strong\u003esome of you know that I am beginning to be involved in some charity work, and that I am also in school for social work. I\u0027m wrapping up my junior year [all of the moving has really put a dent in my progress, which, when you read more, you\u0027ll understand] but I\u0027m excited to work with some organizations in the meantime that play a huge role locally, helping victims of domestic violence, helping homeless children and families, etc. So, the more successful things like this are, the more I\u0027m able to balance doing things like that, which is a personal need derived directly from the experiences in this book / collection!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAhh, it all comes full circle.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTherefore, I figure if this is something you guys are interested in, I can sort of try to make this a living, breathing thing, proportional to people\u0027s interest! The more people are interested, the more I\u0027ll be driven to work on it, and the faster it should come together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, this way, you\u0027ll totally have a hand in it and be able to take credit.*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e*Worst bragging rights ever.\u003c/em\u003e"
