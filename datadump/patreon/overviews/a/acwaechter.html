While I do that, I would love to share \u003cem\u003eRaven \u0026amp; Bone\u003c/em\u003e with you as a piece of serial fiction to help support writing further novels and help me buy tea (for me) and cat food (for my cat,\u00a0Neville).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY I\u0027M ON PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo put it simply? I need some help to keep my writing afloat and I\u0027ve had \u003cem\u003eRaven \u0026amp; Bone\u003c/em\u003e in my back pocket for over a year. R\u0026amp;B was a contestant in the Geek and Sundry Inshares writing contest in 2016, and because I entered late I didn\u0027t make it as far as I would have liked, but R\u0026amp;B did have quite a few backers and we did well in the contest overall. There\u0027s more of the story to tell and this is a good way for all of us to get what we want! More story, more writing, more sharing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DOES THIS PATREON WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ePatreon can work a lot of ways, but for my purposes it\u0027ll work like this:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery month around the full moon I\u0027ll make new chapters of \u003cem\u003eRaven \u0026amp; Bone\u003c/em\u003e and some special extras available for my patrons. There are three levels of support and you can choose what kind of content you\u0027d like to receive. For less than a cuppa at your local joint, you can cuddle up with R\u0026amp;B once a month and immerse yourself in my characters\u0027 worlds... For a little bit more you can find out more about the characters, my process and get an in-depth view into my writing process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll you have to do is sign up!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eABOUT RAVEN \u0026amp; BONE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho put Bella in the wych elm?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWords and sigils, scrawled in blood across walls and miles and time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho put Bella in the wych elm?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnowing the answer requires a journey across worlds and into the darkest of hearts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWho put Bella in the wych elm?\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAva thought she had forever to find out.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAva Aurildis has been running and hiding for a very long time, but at least she has her friends. Lex and Viv have been at her side for decades-- they\u2019re more than friends, they\u2019re her heart\u2019s family. When Viv is brutally murdered, and Lex is rendered incapable of helping, Ava must unravel the mystery that\u2019s haunted them on her own. If she wants any chance of putting her family back together she\u2019ll have to confront her past before time, or something worse, catches up with her.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFIND ME ELSEWHERE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to connect on social media, or see my other digital artwork, screenprinting, etc. please visit my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.allisoncarrwaechter.com/\"\u003ewebsite\u003c/a\u003e or follow me on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/acwaechter/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e to keep in touch.
