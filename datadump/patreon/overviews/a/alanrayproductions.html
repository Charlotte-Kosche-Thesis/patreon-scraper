    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHEY THANKS! Welcome to our Patreon! We love when people take interest in what we are doing and come to support us. We hope you join us in our Patreon community and that you can take something away from the projects that we create.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho Are We?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are a husband and wife production team. One of us is Alan Dickens and the other is Rayanna Dickens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi! \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m Alan\u003c/strong\u003e; I have college degrees in film theory, writing, and Spanish. While in school I started and directed my own film festival with nearly 400 submissions from across the world. I also interned with the documentary services branch of my college. I have worked on many independent and student films starting as an assistant and stage hand, working my way up to writing, directing, and producing my own projects (some of which have won me and others awards.) This past summer I was the Director of Photography as well as an actor in an independent, feature film. While in school, I was also an active member of University\u2019s Film Club/Team and held several leadership positions including President and Event-Coordinator, leading projects and providing advice and resources to those whenever they needed it. I hope to push the art of film making through narrative works, and I also hope to meet and better understand interesting stories via documentary work with unique and interesting people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey! \u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m Rayanna\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027m pursuing a degree in Interdisciplinary Studies Self Design major program. I have been studying writing in several mediums for the past 8 years and am currently focusing on honing my skills in screenplay. I consider my work to be dramatic, literary and experimental. I also have a passion for music beginning from my history in both ballet and theater and am currently writing and storyboarding a cover music video to \"The Boatman\u0027s Call\" by Nick Cave and The Bad Seeds. I\u0027ve been involved in App State Film Club since my freshman year, working mainly as a makeup artists for several short films as well as a for a feature this past summer. In my second semester at App I wrote, filmed and directed an experimental documentary called \"The Painted Doll Speaks\", an exploration of gender politics, a common theme in my work. My goal with my art is to expand both my mind and the minds of those my art reaches and I hope to learn a bit more about the world and myself in the process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTogether we\u2019ve worked on our freelance video and photography business for the past year. We are both passionate about filmmaking and storytelling. We have also honed on our skills after years of study and practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do we offer/do?:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eShort Films: Entertaining shorts with varied styles and genres.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDocumentaries: Exploring individuals, stories, locations, ideas, concepts and many more to learn and expand our minds.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePhotography/Photo-editing: Capture photography of beautiful environments, models, locations, and more.
