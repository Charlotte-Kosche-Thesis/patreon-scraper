    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you and why\nshould I get involved?\u003c/strong\u003e My name is Ayron Jones and I\u2019m a musician based out\nof Seattle, WA. I tour all over the nation and I\u0027m currently\nworking on my follow-up album, which is being produced by Barrett Martin\n(Screaming Trees/Mad Season) and mixed by Jack Endino (Nirvana). This album is\ngoing to feature many guest musicians, some that have worked with Macklemore,\nmembers of Pearl Jam, Guns n\u0027 Roses, and many more we can\u2019t quite announce yet.\nWe want to spread the word about this album all over the world. Constant\ntouring and song sales are paying many of the bills, but to keep up at a\nprofessional level, we need a little more help to elevate what we do. Having the assurance that certain expenses would be covered every month would be great for our budgeting and planning, and take away a lot of stress and concerns.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is this?\u003c/strong\u003e\nPatreon is a crowdsourcing platform that allows a fan to support an artist on\nan ongoing basis. The fan also has the option to change their pledge amount or\ncancel it whenever they want. They get billed at the end of each month during\ntheir pledged commitment. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo it\u2019s like\nKickstarter?\u003c/strong\u003e Not quite. For example, Kickstarter and Indiegogo are platforms that\ntypically only run for 30-45 days, and it\u2019s a one-time only pledge from a fan.\nPlus with Kickstarter, if a minimum goal isn\u2019t met, then the artist doesn\u2019t get\nany of the funding. With Patreon, funding is ongoing and a fan can support for\nas little as $1/month for 10 years if they feel like it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWait, didn\u2019t you do a\nKickstarter campaign already?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes! And it was a huge success that we\u2019re\ngrateful for. That paid for all of our goals listed back then and some more.\nThe problem is that we have new bills to pay and all of those past goals are\ncompleted. Plus, we\u2019ve nearly doubled our fanbase since that Kickstarter\ncampaign and many new fans have said they wished they would have known us back then\nso they could have contributed. This is an opportunity for all of the new fans, and future fans, to get involved!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will this money\ngo towards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m not signed to a record label, so we fund everything\nourselves.  Helping us fund the album\nwill be one use for the funds. For example, it costs us about $800+ for every\nsong we create to write it (rehearsal space), record it, engineer it, mix it\nand then master the song. Then there are cd duplication, artwork and PR costs\nlater down the line. Once this album is finished, we intend to use much of the\nfunding towards tour support. We believe in making the highest quality music videos possible,\nand those can sometimes cost us several thousand dollars each, so portions of\nthis funding will go towards the costs of making great videos! \u003cbr\u003e"
