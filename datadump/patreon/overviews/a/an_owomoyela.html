My work can be found in numerous venues online, as well as a number of Year\u0027s Best compilations.\u00a0 You can \u003ca href=\"http://an.owomoyela.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eread more at my site\u003c/a\u003e, and \u003ca href=\"http://an.owomoyela.net/fiction\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebrowse some of the stories I\u0027ve already written\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do my best to keep my fiction freely available online. In my idealistic view of things, money should be used to facilitate the creation of work, not to get access to it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy High Ideals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2005, I\u0027ve been publishing short stories professionally.\u00a0 Since 2012, I\u0027ve been editing them professionally.\u00a0 And while I think that traditional publishing offers a lot of benefits, I think that newer funding models offer a lot of different ones.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eParticularly, as an artist, I think that people can benefit from seeing their own realities \u2013 of race, culture, experience, ability, gender, sexuality, and all the many diverse facets of identity \u2013 reflected in fiction. And while a great many dialogues roil about the writing world on how to improve these, a more direct connection with people who want their story told and don\u0027t have a way to tell it isn\u0027t a problem that traditional publishing is poised to solve.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of the things I would love to do is to work with my patrons to bring more of the stories they want to see into the world. I won\u0027t be able to work with everyone, nor take on every task (and, of course, I reserve the right to pick and choose what I want to work on), but heroic journies aren\u0027t nearly as fun if the challenges are easily-surmountable.\u00a0 :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow This Patreon Thing Works\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou sign up to give me a certain amount of money for each thing I create and release. (If you want to make sure you don\u0027t go over-budget, you can set a maximum: say, you want to give me $5 per work, but don\u0027t want to spend more than $15 on me per month. Set up a maximum, and even if I write ten things that month, you won\u0027t get overcharged.)\u00a0 Then, I dance \u2013 er, write \u2013 for your amusement.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQuestions and Their Answers\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e What is a work? How do I know I\u0027m getting my money\u0027s worth, if I support you?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cb\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e For the purposes of releasing content through Patreon, I define a work as a complete (for what it is \u2013 a short story will be the entire story, whereas a chapter of a novel will be a complete chapter but \u003cem\u003enot\u003c/em\u003e the complete novel) piece of prose writing \u003cem\u003eno shorter than\u003c/em\u003e 4,000 words long. In reality, I tend to write short stories most frequently at lengths between 5,500 and 11,000 words \u2013 I often joke that I couldn\u0027t write a properly \u003cem\u003eshort\u003c/em\u003e short story to save my life.\u00a0 If, especially in the case of novel chapters, I write something that falls below the 4,000 word minimum, I\u0027ll post it along with another piece of content so that I\u0027m not skimping you on words.\u00a0 So, there may be content releases which consist of two short chapters, or several pieces of flash fiction.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: \u003c/strong\u003eBut don\u0027t you also publish professionally?\u00a0 Why are you here?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I do publish professionally, and I plan to continue doing so. I\u0027m here because I think that alternate publishing models are really interesting, and because I think they can fill some of the needs that traditional publishing can\u0027t.\u00a0 My approach to balancing them will be this: sometimes, I\u0027ll feel that a certain story will be better-suited for a traditional market. If it gets accepted there, that\u0027s where it\u0027ll go.\u00a0 And because many of the professional markets these days are free to read online, that\u0027s some bonus free fiction for you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(I\u0027ll never release content through Patreon if it\u0027s been published elsewhere.\u00a0 The work\u0027s already been paid for, and all of you deserve nice things for sticking with me anyway.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther times, a story might not find a match with an editor\u0027s tastes, or I\u0027ll be writing stories specifically for you guys.\u00a0 Then, it goes here, and I\u0027m working for you.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ:\u003c/strong\u003e Do I have to be a patron to read your stuff?\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Nope! None of the fiction I create for and release through Patreon will be backers-only.\u00a0 I\u0027m invested in keeping my fiction free to read, and I know these are tough times for a lot of people. I may offer other work or merchandise which you can buy, and of course I hope that people will like what I\u0027m doing enough to support me or tip me... but if all you can spend on fiction is the time it takes to read it, I still know you\u0027ve spent something, and I appreciate the gift. :)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e"
