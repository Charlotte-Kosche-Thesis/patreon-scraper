Duchamp, claimed that since he was an artist, he had the right to decide what was \u201cART\u201d and thus, conceptual art was born\u2026\u2026\u2026..  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlmost a hundred years later, one man walked into an airplane toilet, and decided that, while that toilet was certainly a toilet, it could also become, for a brief period of time, a theatre\u2026\u2026and thus, the work of the \u003ca href=\"http://www.tonypenultimate.co.uk/attc/\"\u003eAirline Toilets Theatre Company\u003c/a\u003e (ATTC) began.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet me explain\u2026\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work as a professional musician with a band called the Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain, and we play all over the world. Travelling on planes is pretty boring and uncomfortable, especially when you\u2019re as tall as I am (6\u20198\u201d/2.05m) and so you need to keep yourself occupied.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe little film you\u0027ve just watched is the latest in a \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYYosftqFreuw4ca9C8JwtyXzW3xb-y9S\"\u003eseries of films\u003c/a\u003e I started making on areoplanes last year, and put up online over Christmas as a fundraising exercise, and guess what, people liked it and I hit my target! So I \u2018retired\u2019 for a while, but the temptation was too strong not to go back into those toilets and keep on working!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then I thought, maybe there are other folks out there on Planet Internet who might want to join the party, and I immediately thought of Patreon.......\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is your way to join in the fun!  \u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not asking you to pay for my flight - that\u0027s paid for\u2026\u2026\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not asking you to pay for my hotel room - that\u0027s paid for too\u2026\u2026  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut, while I might have raised $1000 for \u003ca href=\"https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/peter-brooke-turner1\"\u003ehomeless people\u003c/a\u003e with my last bunch of films, I also had to pay out big bucks on props, costumes, lenses and video editing etc, and I felt that somewhere, someone, might be keen for me to carry on......\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I\u2019m sticking my hand out online and asking for your support in return for exclusive access to my forthcoming projects and all the \u0027behind the scenes\u0027 action.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince this is my second season of films, I\u2019ve upped my game and will be making three/four films per year - you can pledge towards each project as you like. This season will be more exciting as I\u0027ve started using make up and I\u0027ve got some studio lights as well!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u2019ll get the real lowdown with demo recordings, story boards, script ideas and much more as I continue to make music videos in the toilets of commercial airliners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\u003ch2\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e"
