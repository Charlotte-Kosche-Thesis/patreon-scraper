Anne, Alberta, currently living in Edmonton. I am a full-time grad student at the Faculty of Native Studies at the University of Alberta, looking at developing some best practices for scaffolding Cree language literacy resources. I am also working full time, supporting our family of 4 while being unreasonably pregnant (due in May!).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I blog on a variety of\n Indigenous issues at \u003ca href=\"http://apihtawikosisan.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u00e2pihtawikosis\u00e2n.com\u003c/a\u003e, I co-host the Indigenous sci-fi podcast \u003ca href=\"http://metisinspace.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eM\u00e9tis In Space\u003c/a\u003e (which you can find on the \u003ca href=\"http://www.indianandcowboy.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIndian and Cowboy Media Network\u003c/a\u003e), I produce and host the \u003ca href=\"http://apihtawikosisan.com/language-links-2/cree-podcast/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eUnsettling Your Language podcast\u003c/a\u003e, and I run the \u003ca href=\"http://apihtawikosisan.com/indigenousxca/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e@IndigenousXca\u003c/a\u003e twitter account, which features a new Indigenous host each week!

I am also trying to work on a collection of M\u00e9tis-centric speculative fiction short stories that I\u0027d love to eventually get published sometime next year. I just have to get my pesky MA thesis out of the way :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n don\u0027t get paid to do any of these things, and in fact the cost to \ncontinue writing, podcasting and developing other resources for \non-and-offline Indigenous communities, is fairly high. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n If you make use of the content I create, and you\u0027d like to see more of \nit, I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll pledge a small amount (or large if you\u0027re \nmega-rich) every month to keep things going!

These books would also be provided in an optional \"blank\" format for people to translate the text into their own Cree dialect, or into their own Indigenous language, and I could purchase a little more space on the sakihitowinlearning website to host these user-created resources for others to use!\u003cbr\u003e",

Some of those s\u00f4niyaws would obviously be for covering our living costs, but the rest would continue to go towards hiring Indigenous graphic artists to help create Cree-language leveled literacy books, and towards whatever costs there may be associated with literally getting paid to create as much Indigenous educational content as humanly possible, each month! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t really expect to ever hit this goal, but I thought I\u0027d let you know what it would take, in case one of you happens to be a thrillionaire who wants me to dedicate my every waking moment to Indigenous language revitalization LIKE AN OKIM\u00c2W!!!!\u003cbr\u003e",
