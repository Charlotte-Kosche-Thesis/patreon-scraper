    "summary": "Welcome, potential patron-person!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m an author, journalist, columnist and failed indie rock star. I live and work in Adelaide, Australia, although when I first wrote this bit \"Adelaide\" was spelled \"Sydney\", and I\u0027ve written two books on politics and one on music, as well as writing for the Sydney Morning Herald, the Guardian, the ABC, Rolling Stone, Cosmos, the Monthly, Time Out, NME, Elle, and pretty much anyone else with a freelance budget, and I\u0027m also the co-host of\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/the-double-disillusionists/id1113159799?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe Double Disillusionists podcast with Dom Knight\u003c/a\u003e. There\u0027s\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://andrewpstreet.com/\"\u003emore information at m\u0027website\u003c/a\u003e, should you need it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith the release of my new book\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.booktopia.com.au/the-long-and-winding-way-to-the-top-andrew-p-street/prod9781760293727.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Long and Winding Way To The Top: Fifty (or so) Songs That Made Australia\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ve drifted predominantly back into writing about music, at least for the time being. But a part of my heart belongs to the noble art of getting snarky about politics, as befits my first two books -\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.booktopia.com.au/the-short-and-excruciatingly-embarrassing-reign-of-captain-abbott-andrew-p-street/prod9781760290542.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Short \u0026amp; Excruciatingly Embarrassing Reign of Captain Abbott\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.booktopia.com.au/the-curious-story-of-malcolm-turnbull-the-incredible-shrinking-man-in-the-top-hat-andrew-p-street/prod9781760294885.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Curious Story of Malcolm Turnbull: the Incredible Shrinking Man in the Top Hat\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil the mid-2017 cutsapolooza of both staff and contributors at Fairfax I had a column in the SMH called View from the Street, which was essentially a left-leaning rant about Australian politics written by someone that likes people, likes Australia, and feels like Australia could be doing a hell of a lot better a job at looking after people generally. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd you know what? I miss it. And according to the emails and messages I get, other people miss it too. And in these often grim times when it seems that conservative voices control the public narrative, sometimes it\u0027s good to yell through the darkness and, hopefully, give some clues to a better and more equitable way of doing things.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have reinvented it - or at least something sort of like it - as a subscriber-only thrice-weekly newsletter-slash-column for a mere $3 a month. (That\u0027s US$3, just to be clear.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere may well be swears. There will almost certainly be embedded Guided by Voices videos. There may be photos of my baby son being adorable, because by thunder, he\u0027s the freakin\u0027 cutest thing in the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you thought View from the Street was informative and funny and gave you a skerrick of hope for the future of Australian politics, then that\u0027s very much the model. If you didn\u0027t\u2026 um, this might not be the Patreon for you. But thanks for popping by.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you, dear potential and current patrons. By signing up to this you\u0027re helping to get some ranty, lefty screeds out into the universe, and I\u0027m deeply flattered and insanely grateful."
