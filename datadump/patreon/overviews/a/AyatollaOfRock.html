    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Ayatolla, and I make erotic images of popular video game characters in Valve\u0027s Source Filmmaker. Check out my blog at ayatollaofrock.tumblr.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started on a forum called DigitalEro, following tutorials on how to pose and using the ever-popular Mass Effect models to practice. I started experimenting with comics, first was the lesbian story of Kasumi Goto in \u0027New Memories\u0027, set in the Mass Effect universe. Sticking with the Mass Effect universe, I started a comic called \u0027Samantha\u0027s Dreams\u0027. This followed the character Samantha Traynor and her sexually fuelled dreams of her co-workers and beyond. I found it to be a fun way to expand from Mass Effect, and kept it light hearted with genuine comedy. This comic saw some success, which lead me to try a longer-form comic, trying to tell a cohesive story across multiple characters, called \u0027The Blockade\u0027. While The Blockade was a helpful experiment, it wasn\u0027t nearly as fun or successful as I\u0027d have liked.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut then I tried my hand at running a Tumblr blog. DigitalEro was generally a great place for me to share my work, but Tumblr provided more freedom, a wider audience base, and a site that didn\u0027t go down based on the whims of admins (the fault of any forum, not just DE specifically). With the switch to tumblr I also decided to focus on single images, rather than comics. I also generally kept things soft core. This set of switches moved this niche hobby which maybe got 3 replies on a niche forum to 2,500+ followers on my blog in the space of 6 months. That was a fun time, creatively I grew and experimented.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIdeally I\u0027d like to devote more time to SFM (and beyond!), but maintaining the balance between SFM, University, and working to pay for the essentials is difficult, and is the primary reason I make the amount of content I do. The less I have to work, the more content I can make.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis last point is to state that my Patreon is open ONLY if people want to donate money to help me put more time into SFM. I also keep my posts to Tumblr, so there\u0027s no Patron-only content (yet, if there\u0027s interest I\u0027d look into it). Please only donate if you understand what I mean, I don\u0027t want to get messages in 3 months complaining I\u0027m not posting or anything.\u003cbr\u003e"
