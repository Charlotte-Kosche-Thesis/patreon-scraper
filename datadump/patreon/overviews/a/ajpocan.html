    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eThe reason I am on Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason I am on Patreon is simple: YouTube has changed its policies in concern to smaller channels like mine. It no longer wants to support us and our creative talents. I no longer wish to support them as much as before due to the company not supporting us; here is where things change: while I will continue to upload to my channel on YouTube, it will be just enough to keep it active (once a month) to not let my 2,000 Subscribers down. Over 7 years of hard work and with over 2 million total views from 120 different videos, it is time to venture out to see what other opportunities I have to share my music with others. This is where Patreon comes into play; Patreon is the perfect platform for smaller musicians like myself; it gives me a chance to grow and find new ways to share my passion in life, which is creating music. I have many plans for Patreon (highlighted in the rewards section), though my main priority is to learn new music and to cover songs I love, as well as sharing my own music on a more consistent basis, which will be available anytime you want to listen to, with patron exclusive downloads. To see more of my plans, please visit my rewards section. For anyone willing to support and view my content, I appreciate you more than you could ever know. Here is a short bio of who I am and where I come from:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHello!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey guys my name is A.J, I am your average 21 year old that lives in Spokane, Washington; originally from Missoula, Montana; thanks for visiting my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been playing piano since I was about 11 years old.\n\nMy top inspiration in music is the band Coldplay. I hope to one day be in a band where I can travel all over the world, or maybe go on a solo tour and just enjoy playing my music.\n\nI dream of touring with a band basically every free moment I have, and really want to make my career in music. Now this does not mean making millions of dollars, and or becoming famous; I would just love to have people support me in my dream of making music for a living. If you wish to support me, I thank you.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently attend Spokane Falls Community College in Spokane, WA, finishing my A.A.S in Audio Engineering. With this skill set obtained, I hope to flourish in my music making abilities in the near future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI play almost all songs by ear, but can read sheet music; I just don\u0027t prefer it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you or someone you know has business proposals, Media Inquiries, Collaboration requests (basically anything) or something similar, please feel free to contact me anytime via my email: pianocovers.atothej@gmail.com"
