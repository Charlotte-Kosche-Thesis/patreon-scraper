You\u2019ll be the first to hear my new recordings, and there\u2019s perks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\"Perks, you say?\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy, yes, I \u003cem\u003edo\u003c/em\u003e say! For just $1, you get access to new recordings as I make them, immediate access to mp3 tracks as they are released, song previews \u0026amp; tour announcements available here first, and I\u2019ll thank you for being my patron on my website. You want to give me more than $1? Then scroll down for your rewards, my friend!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA bit more about me - I\u2019ve been a full-time professional musician since 2010, playing mainly Renaissance festivals and SCA events, with the occasional Con thrown in for flavor. I love discovering music from different countries, and I play a ton of instruments - hurdy gurdy, bowed psaltery, flute, pennywhistle, piano, Pianonomicon (my toy piano-thing),  bodhran, and bones - and I sing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\"What is Patreon, anyway?\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is for artists looking to fund a steady stream of their work on a small scale. I\u2019m asking you to contribute as little as $1 (or as much as you\u2019d like) per month, which will help me with recording, recording equipment, instrument repair, vehicle repair, food\u2026you know, the basics.  Patreon allows you to set a month maximum, if you like, and you can cancel or suspend your contributions at any time and we\u2019ll still be friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\"What all are you planning to do?\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is writing and recording a geek music album (tentatively called \"One Nerdy Knight\"). I\u0027ll be posting all of the song lyrics here as I write them, and also posting the recordings here first. \u00a0For 2017, I made a musical Thing A Week for many weeks (it got the best of me, but I\u0027m proud of what I made!) Those videos are on YouTube, but you can see all my outtakes here. \u00a0As far as albums go, I\u0027ve currently got two: \u201cAllons-y! Time Traveler\u2019s Tunes\u201d (what the Doctor might have heard while traveling through time) and \"Dance The Knight Away\" (SCA Renaissance and Medieval dance tune favorites). \u00a0After I\u0027m done with the geek album, I\u0027m planning my take on Hildegard von Bingen\u2019s gorgeous music, the Cantigas de Amigo (Songs of my Boyfriend), and the music of the trobairitz (female troubadours of the 12th and 13th centuries). Girl Power! \u00a0I\u0027ve also had an idea (thanks to the LORE podcast) to make a holiday album about historical monsters (like Krampus, La Bivana, and so on.) That one is going to be fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I\u2019m also planning on doing some live streaming web concerts. Won\u0027t you join me?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(31,73,125);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255,255,255);\"\u003e\"That\u2019s great, but I have this idea for you\u2026\"\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAwesome! Just as Renaissance patrons had input into the creative processes of their musicians, I would love for you, my patron, to suggest things for me to record. My plethora of instruments and I are at your disposal!\u003cbr\u003e"
