(For example: we would love to hire a copy editor and be\nable to afford a small stipend so that we could establish monthly guest\ncuratorships; long-term we would like this to become our day job so that we can\npursue various creative projects in the time that was previously earmarked for\nthis.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAcetylene Eyes seeks your support in helping transform\nthis project into some serious next-level shit."
