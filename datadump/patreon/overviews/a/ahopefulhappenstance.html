    "summary": "I\u0027ve been so blessed to be able to stay home with my tiny human and spend so much time with her in these early years! It\u0027s not always easy or fun but it is always a blessing. Somewhere along the way I went nuts and started a blog. I think everyone thought it was silly and I kind of did too at first. But I love writing and I love the platform and all the doors it could open in the future.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t quite know where it will take me yet. That\u0027s both incredibly frustrating and insanely exciting. But I do know that God can take anything small and turn into into something I never imagined. So I wait, pray, brainstorm, and listen to hear what\u0027s coming around the corner. And until then I\u0027ll press on, keep creating, keep sharing, keep loving my kiddo, keep loving my readers, keep trying to infuse a bit of honest, hope, and help into the lives of those who chose to come along with me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI plan to keep creating but it takes so much time to do the basics of keeping up with the site which made using this platform sound so intriguing. My supporters and readers are amazing and so incredibly engaged with me and I could never ask for more than that. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, if you love the stuff I produce and bring to share with you and you just want to support me in some way I wanted to put this out there just for you. Your support will enable me to reach so many goals so much faster than I ever could alone and I\u0027ll be eternally grateful for that; especially on the long, sleepy, there\u0027s pee on the floor and cheerios in my hair kinds of days. I\u0027ll think of you when I clean up those messes then I\u0027ll jump on here and tell you all about it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading this far; a round of applause for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany Blessings,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePayton Foeller, A Hopeful Happenstance\u003cbr\u003e"

This has been one of my goals all along - she LOVES \u0027school\u0027 - she constantly talks about all her friends there from when we send her on occasion and she has soo much fun. Some socialization is surely great for her - and I know that extra time to work and relax is great for me (and subsequently everyone else on the earth). I can\u0027t wait to proudly say I can cover this cost!",

I think all SAHM\u0027s need something to do that requires some brain power and for me this has been a wonderful outlet. Hitting this goal would mean that I would have enough resources to invest some back into the website to help us grow it and reach more people.

But enough to pay some bills and bring home some bacon. Hitting this goal would make me incredibly proud to be able to, not just actively, but significantly pitch in with our bills and expenses and for that I would be enternally grateful to all of my supporters!",
