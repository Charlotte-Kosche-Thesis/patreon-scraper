Since 2013, we have grown into an important resource for anyone interested in the diverse and vital range of experimental and emerging practices taking place at the intersection of art, music and internet culture. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough regular editorial programming, we provide a space for a wide network of contributing artists and writers, supporting critical thought around online culture, structural inequality in the industry and promoting underrepresented voices. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt a time when public funding is increasingly difficult to obtain, we guarantee the continuation of AQNB.com by working on a volunteer basis to provide editorial support, as well as paying for server costs and a developer to look after the site. However, we still need to raise a monthly budget to pay our contributors for their excellent work. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the coming months we will be developing this Patreon account, opening it up to our wider readership. But for now, we are asking you \u2013 the galleries, venues, festivals and labels we like and who have an existing relationship with AQNB \u2013 for your help and encouragement by way of a monthly donation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support us in our goal, we will support you. Awards for donations are geared towards promoting your work to the AQNB community through advertising banners, events listings and social media shout outs. We have limited the number available to ensure that sponsored content will get the best possible coverage. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll funds raised will go directly to pay editorial fees. So, if you like AQNB.com, think it should stick around and want to be part of it, you can make a big difference by signing up for as little as $1 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much and watch this space\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3 \u003cbr\u003eCaroline, HP and JK\u003cbr\u003e"
