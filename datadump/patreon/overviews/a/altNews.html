    "summary": "altNews.com is going to become the go-to website for reliably reported alternative news and information. We deliver the news the mainstream media is ignoring, without the hyperbole and conjecture found elsewhere in the alternative media. altNews is a multi-media brand, producing original articles at altNews.com, podcasting on iTunes \u0026amp; SoundCloud and broadcasting a syndicated live show three days a week on YouTube \u0026amp; Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are trying something a bit revolutionary with altNews. \u003cstrong\u003eWe intend to deliver the altNews experience completely ad and sponsor free.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0No ads on the website, no ads during the show.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn an advertiser-based model, there is going to be a bias towards producing content which is \"hot\" or \"controversial\" simply for the resulting clicks, taking away from coverage of more important issues. By relying on our audience for support, our only incentive is to create the most value for our fans, regardless of what is currently trending on Facebook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe didn\u2019t join this fight for the money (obviously!), but we believe in the value we provide our audience and intend to show that a model focused on the listener instead of the advertiser is financially viable. We want to break the mold while leaving a blueprint for other watchmen to follow in our footsteps.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo pledge support to this channel is to put yourself right on the front lines of this war and, we propose, on the right side of history. We don\u2019t sell t-shirts or coffee mugs (yet), so you can be sure every dollar you contribute will go directly towards producing the news you can\u2019t find anywhere else."

Information has never been more important and I\u0027m an information addict, looking to give a fix to other junkies out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was selling exotic cars in the SF Bay Area in late 2015 when I first learned about the deception of 9/11 and then quickly learned of other hoaxes and false flags our government has been involved with and the media has helped to cover up over the years. I received most of my education on YouTube, but in the process I found that something was missing for me from the conversation. I was looking for a calm, reasoned and rational voice pointing out legitimate problems with the official story but staying away from conjecture and hyperbole. Not having any luck in my search, I finally got up the courage to show some of my own research and posted my first video to my new YouTube channel,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eLift the Veil,\u003c/em\u003e on December 1, 2015, covering the events from Paris and the Bataclan Theater. The San Bernardino attacks, which I ended up covering extensively, happened the next day and 2 days later I was laid off from my job. That unlikely sequence of events gave me the time to focus on my videos and I suddenly found myself learning how to make compelling videos and building a small but devoted following. I was hooked and, after a short time at a new dealership, I decided selling cars wasn\u0027t going to do it for me anymore and I decided to devote myself full time to bringing people the truth.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love my audience and I truly appreciate having your support on this ambitious project.\u003cbr\u003e",
