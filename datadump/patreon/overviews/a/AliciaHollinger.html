The first one will be sci-fi called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eCHEESECAKE GALACTICA!\u003c/span\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eThen I\u0027d like to do more themes, like Steampunk, fairies, angels, elves, hot girls and cars, hot girls and motorcycles and lingerie pin-ups and if anyone has any other ideas, please let me know! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNext is the one I\u0027m really excited about as a lover of sci-fi and quantum physics! It\u0027s a graphic novel/transmedia project called \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eQUANTUM PARTY GIRLS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e that I describe as TMZ meets Stargate.\u00a0 (I will explain later where the concept came from!) It will have extra content on the web that will reveal what is really going on in the heads of the main characters in their individual blogs and have other content that will only be found on that separate site. It will be cool for fans to get to know the characters better outside of the comic. I may charge a monthly fee for this after a month free trial to try to get fans hooked. I am then hoping to create an app, and then a second one in VR! Any app developers out there who would like to partner with me? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003eQUANTUM PARTY GIRLS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e will be a fun satire of Hollywood combined with \nsci-fi that is now starting to become sci-FACT! Wormholes, travels to \nother planets and dimensions. Yes, people have fictionally gone where \nnobody has gone before, but LA girls never have. Are there VIP sections \non those worlds? Part humor and satire, part real sci-fi adventure, there will be something for everyone here. This is something that females can enjoy as much as males. This will not be adult really, nothing that couldn\u0027t be shown on network TV, well, maybe HBO or Netflix...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, my ultimate goal is to have it made into a TV or movie project. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also looking for product placement for within the comic itself. The lead characters are LA beautiful girls who attend the top VIP parties in Hollywood. Sponsors may want them to be seen drinking their brand of alcohol or soft drinks, authors may want them to read their book, artist might like their art on the walls of the home of the girls (a mansion!) or at restaurants and nightclubs. A DJ could announce someone\u0027s song or the girls could be shown checking out an an artist\u0027s CD. The characters could talk about an upcoming actor and people can even become characters in the comic. If anyone is interested in this aspect, please let me know. We can do a one time fee for you to have product placement. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ssXbgPl.jpg\" style=\"width: 269px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbove is the prototype for one of the characters, Londyn Banks. She is a wealthy heiress who has been there, done that and gets bored ridiculously easily.

However, \nthe young aliens were determined to find a loophole so they could \nexperience Earth fun for themselves. Even aliens have their geeks and \none smart young alien with the specialized knowledge of generating \n\"Quantum Portals,\" experiments in creating an interdimensional wormhole \nthat can transport them to L.A. to visit their hot new crush, \ncelebutante Londyn Banks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe three young Greys are successful \nin their endeavors and are thrilled to visit Londyn\u0027s Hollywood Hills \nMansion and peep in on the stunning redhead and her two new housemates, \nMadison and Candi. They accidentally leave a key piece of technology in \nLondyn\u0027s home, allowing the girls to activate the portal themselves. The\n three adventurous girls venture through the portal believing they must \nbe dreaming, this would never happen in REAL life...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat happens once through the portal? Stay tuned... :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHE MAIN CHARACTERS:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMADISON:\n A glamorous brunette, freelance entertainment reporter for \"Hollywood \nPop\" magazine. Born in Manhattan, NY, she attended the best upper East \nSide prep schools and went on to graduate with honors from Harvard. \nMadison loves to learn about everything, experience everything, meet \neverybody. To her, life is one big amusement park and she wants to try \nall the rides. She loves going to parties, but is not a bimbo. She loves\n talking about everything from quantum physics to art and philosophy and\n is a bit of a geek magnet, but most of the parties she goes to have \nmore celebrities than geeks. She has coined herself the \u201cover-educated \nparty girl.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCANDI: A beautiful bubbly blonde and yes, her boobs \nand lips are real, although no one believes they are. People pay plastic\n surgeons thousands of dollars to look the way Candi looks naturally. \nFrom a small town in Illinois, she was always the pretty popular girl. \nShe skipped college and moved to L.A. to become a swimwear and lingerie \nmodel. Candi always has a smile on her face, a giggle in her voice and \ncan have fun anywhere. Men fall to their knees at the sight of her and \nlove to help her in any way they can. She especially attracts wealthy \nmen who love to shower her with expensive gifts and money.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLONDYN:\n A stunning redhead celebutante, daughter of Real Estate mogul Richard \nBanks, Londyn gets paid millions of dollars just to attend parties most \npeople would kill to go to. She\u2019s been there, done that, gets bored \neasily and refuses to go anywhere that doesn\u2019t have a VIP section. She \nhas everything she could possibly want but feels empty inside, always \nlooking for something to amuse her, fulfill her, but never finds it. \nWith a very short attention span, as soon as she arrives a one party, \nshe\u2019s ready to move on to the next. Always looking for the bigger, \nbetter, most exclusive party, nothing is ever good enough.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \nthree girls seem to lead charmed lives, but there is more going on than \nothers know. They will have separate blogs for their stories. Their connection to \nthe three Greys alter their lives in innumerable ways, and it soon \nbecomes clear that \u201creality\u201d is not at all what they thought it was\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSTAY TUNED for the adventures of the QUANTUM PARTY GIRLS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, so the idea for Quantum Party Girls actually came to me while waiting in the co-ed line for the bathroom at the Playboy Mansion. It was a \"sleepwear\" party, meaning lingerie for girls and mostly robes for guys... But it was really cold, yes, it gets cold in LA in the winter, and the party was outdoors under tents, but still cold. So, I was wearing this long black coat that covered me from neck to foot, covering the lingerie under it. All the girls around me were blondes with boob jobs with the skimpiest lingerie possible and some were even naked with spray painted clothes, apparently oblivious to the cold or suffering to be sexy... While in line, for some reason I blurted out something about quantum physics (not sure where that came from!) and immediately all the guys gathered around me to discuss quantum physics. The poor boob job girls were not used to being ignored and kept trying to join in the conversation but were promptly dismissed by the guys (obviously regulars to the mansions, their excitement over the Playmates having waned...) And that\u0027s where I had an epiphany, what if you mixed hot girls WITH quantum physics. Both guys and girls like seeing beauty, face it, and I can mix my knowledge of Hollywood parties and VIP sections and add some fun satire and combine it with my love of sci-fi and quantum physics!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor sci-fi, comic \u0026amp; video game lovers, have a favorite sci-fi or fantasy character you\u0027d like for me to create?

     "description": "Hi everyone,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alicia Hollinger and this is a relaunch of my Patreon site!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m focusing mostly here on sci-fi, fantasy, comic, gaming, pop culture and all types of PINUP ART! My goals here are to create more art for prints and galleries, a second Pinup Art book, this time focusing specifically on sci-fi called CHEESECAKE GALACTICA (and later more themed books like fantasy, Steampunk, lingerie, retro, girls and cars and more!) I\u0027ll be posting all different genres here, so let me know what your favorites are!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next goal is a graphic novel/transmedia project described elsewhere on this site, a VR project, I\u0027m obsessed with VR! And an app, a game, an animated or live action TV series based on the graphic novels and... And... And I can dream, right?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also would like to hire a publicist to help get the word out about my work. I really hate tooting my own horn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mRYKIav.jpg\" style=\"width: 423px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art was featured in Heavy Metal Magazine, in a group art book published by Heavy Metal, on comic book covers, magazine, book, CD covers, and movie posters. I have my first (of I hope several!) pinup art book on Amazon \u003ca href=\"http://bit.ly/AliciaPinup1\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen life happened and now I\u0027m working to get back on my feet again. My real first goal is just making rent and expenses after the horror that started in 2013...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot to sound like a sob story, but the truth is, the last four years of my life have been hell... I am an only child and have never lived farther than 15 minutes from my parents and was very close to them, maybe a bit co-dependent LOL... But hell began when my mother had a stroke and after her return from the rehab hospital, my father and I took care of her, and without going into details, it was pretty horrific. Finally my father hired a caregiver but on weekends we took over but my mother was a whole other person and taking care of her was to say the least, extremely harrowing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen I incurred a bad knee injury and was on crutches for months, then a knee brace for many months after that. Just as I was getting better, my mother went to the hospital for a small thing, caught a bad infection there and died...\u00a0 Shortly before her death, my father fell and injured his back badly and we kept the caregiver for him and on weekends I took over, and spent a good portion of my time helping take him to numerous doctors, do errands etc... because he couldn\u0027t be left alone. He had other big medical problems, but this is just getting too depressing, so I\u0027ll move on...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMore fun times--another fluke accident caused ME to fracture my right shoulder. Couldn\u0027t do a thing during that time, I had to have nurses come to help me shower! Finally recovered then had to move my father to a nursing home, clean out decades of belongings from their apartment and store in storage that I\u0027m now paying for. Anyone want to buy antiques??? Seriously, hit me up if you do...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this leads to the worse part... My father caught pneumonia in the nursing home and went to the ER. The doctors said, don\u0027t worry, the antibiotics are working, he\u0027ll be fine. He wasn\u0027t. He died....\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs an only child who never lived farther than 15 minutes away from my parents this was devastating and it put me into a big depression for quite a while... Then, just as I thought things were getting better, my foot was run over and crushed as a morbidly obese woman on a very heavy motorized wheelchair ran over my sandaled foot at Comic-Con! And she saw me! She said \"I said wheelchair coming, but you didn\u0027t move!\" Obviously, if I had heard her, I would have moved! So more time on crutches, then a big boot, six months of foot therapy, healing took forever.... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBUT, now I\u0027m BACK!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e A Phoenix risen from the ashes! I did create some new art during even the horror period and will post it here first for patrons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first goal is to enhance, improve and update some older art to make it the best I can and post it on my art sale site \u003ca href=\"https://alicia-hollinger.pixels.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e. All paid patrons will get varying degrees of discounts on all art purchased there (wrapped canvas, art prints, even shower curtains, duvets, phone covers, mugs, greeting cards and more!) And all patrons will get a first look at all new and improved art and I would love for your opinions, let me know what you think! Which do you like better, what do you want to see in the future? Higher end patrons get custom art, and at the highest level, have full rights and can make T-shirts or whatever they want with it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the detailed perks at different tiers are described in the patron tier sections. So I really hope you can join my Patreon team and I DEEPLY appreciate any and all help!\u003cbr\u003e",
