Who are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe\u2019re Heather and Cyrus, two lovebirds who happened to share a passion for adventurous or \u003cem\u003eless than traditional\u003c/em\u003e eating. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe started our Arousing Appetites journey in 2013 with a super rookie website as a way to keep ourselves honest about what we were trying out in the kitchen. It was basically our way of keeping track of the hodgepodge of recipes we were cooking.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOver time, we\u2019ve gotten a lot better at developing thoughtful, healthy recipes from all sorts of cuisines around the world. A woo-worthy fish and rice noodle soup from Burma? No sweat. A Tahitian ceviche salad to go with a refreshing watermelon Tongan drink? Piece of (Australian lamington) cake!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eArousing Appetites has become a truly concerted effort to recreate recipes from around the world in a way that\u2019s:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e1) Super healthy\u003cbr\u003e2) Quick\u003cbr\u003e3) Affordable\u003cbr\u003e4) DELICIOUS\u003cbr\u003e5) And easy, so someone of any cooking skill level can enjoy from the confines of their kitchen\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd as self-professed history geeks, we also dedicate a part of each post to uncover and share with you fun histories and traditions that make the recipes so special in the local cuisine today.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, so why this Patreon campaign?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere\u2019s a couple of things we\u2019ve come to realize in our time building up this blog:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1) There\u2019s a lot of love going around for Arousing Appetites\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eYes, we absolutely love researching, writing, photographing and preparing everything on Arousing Appetites. And we are delighted that you seem to like it too! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eOver the course of exploring cuisines from ~80 countries over the past year+, we\u2019ve developed an amazing fanbase of enthusiastic readers and fellow cooks like you. We love the feedback you send us about our weekly posts and newsletters, and we really love the out-of-the-blue \u201cTHANK YOU\u201d emails\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBUT\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2) Running the blog is an \u003cem\u003eintense commitment\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s pretty much become a full-time gig for the both of us to create the type of high-quality content you deserve, and it costs thousands of dollars a month simply to sustain it.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhich brings us to\u2026\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3) To make Arousing Appetites work (and grow), it needs to become self-sustaining\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThrough what you might call Arousing Appetites\u2019s \u201cAct One,\u201d we\u2019ve been funding its growth with our own savings, which has only worked \u003cem\u003epretty okay\u003c/em\u003e to this point.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, it has only been able to take us so far, and it\u2019s not a sustainable way to ensure that we can keep Arousing Appetites on the air for very long. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe need to find a way to let Arousing Appetites run on its own in a healthy, sustainable way, so we can work on improving the blog and delivering even better, more interactive content to you!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhich Brings Us to Patreon\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAt this point, now would be a good point to talk about ads... we don\u2019t like them and don\u0027t use them. We know other blogs can make a good income by putting ads on their sites, but it\u2019s really not for us.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe want you to have an ad-free and \u003cem\u003eclean\u003c/em\u003e reading experience every time you visit to Arousing Appetites, even if it means foregoing what you might call the \u201ceasy money\u201d of ads. It\u2019s more worth it to us that you have the best possible experience with our Arousing Appetites, than it is for us to make a quick buck.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThat means, though, that our work depends on the generous support of people like you. And if you\u2019ve made it this far down this page, you seem to have a soft spot in your heart for Arousing Appetites (which we love and appreciate you for).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo if you find any joy or stimulation from the recipes and discussions we provide, please consider offering a modest donation to help us keep Arousing Appetites ad-free and going strong.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat The Money Goes To\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf we hit our funding goal, we strongly believe it can help us keep Arousing Appetites going strong for a long, long time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy that particular amount, though? \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWe thought about this one long and hard, and here\u2019s a few \u201cbuckets\u201d into which we\u2019d make dedicated use of the funds:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRegular Blog Expenses\u003c/strong\u003e. Probably the biggest bucket of all\u2026 This is stuff like web hosting, monthly software subscription costs, groceries (we are a food blog, after all), social media promotion, cooking and kitchen equipment, food props, and a lot of other unsexy things like this. Not only could we use the help in covering expenses, but we could also use a massive upgrade in things like hosting\u2026 which costs a pretty penny.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHelping Hands\u003c/strong\u003e. This is probably the most \u003cem\u003eexciting\u003c/em\u003e one of all. We have so many opportunities and ideas for how we can improve the overall Arousing Appetites experience. For one\u2026 VIDEO! Maybe you were a little confused by our text directions on how to fold and make Mongolian Buuz (dumplings)? We wouldn\u2019t be surprised, and we\u2019d have loved to make a video for you if we had the resources for it. The minute we can budget in things like video production or more website development (we\u2019re not coders), that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re going to do.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUs Needing to Live. \u003c/strong\u003eAs ironic as it sounds coming from a pair of food bloggers, we need to make sure we eat too. We\u2019re pretty low maintenance and don\u2019t need a lot to keep up our standard of living, but if we\u2019re to continue dedicating all this time and effort into Arousing Appetites, we do need a little bit to cover ourselves too.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\nThose three primary areas are pretty much it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo to recap, if we can:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e1) Cover existing expenses, \u003cbr\u003e\n2) Have a little cushion to grow and improve the blog, and\u003cbr\u003e\n3) Occasionally feed and cloth ourselves\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e...then Arousing Appetites lives on forever!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we can somehow surpass our funding goal (which would be so awesome), everything still gets used to build and grow Arousing Appetites into a greater experience. We\u2019d love to test interactive videos, physical cookbooks, apps, etc\u2026 but that\u2019s only once we know we can keep things going stong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please consider a modest donation. Even something as modest as $1/month - especially when it comes from the heart - is the type of gesture that makes all the difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you in advance, and be well\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCyrus and Heather\u003cbr\u003e"
