Plus I could then do things like\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003ethemed cover\u00a0albums, an original EP, \u003c/strong\u003eand maybe even \u003cstrong\u003eplay live/go on tour\u003c/strong\u003e in the future.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTHANK YOU for your support. \u0026lt;3\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve noticed a majority of people think the harp only does one thing: \u003cem\u003etinkly fairy music\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eIf you\u0027ve come here from my YouTube channel, you know it can be\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eso much more\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0than that. I am on a mission to show the world that the harp is a\u00a0\u003cem\u003eversatile and virtuosic\u003c/em\u003e instrument, and can be a \u003cstrong\u003econtemporary instrument\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0as readily as any other\u003cstrong\u003e.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0And I\u0027m asking you to join me in making that possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrently I make a living performing at weddings, but I also upload at least \u003cstrong\u003eone video per month to YouTube\u003c/strong\u003e, and that\u0027s what I really love doing. Weddings have been an amazing testing ground, but now I want to bring all that work to \u003cstrong\u003eyou.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0That means I need to spend more time and resources on arranging/shooting videos and less time on my event clients.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a pretty sizeable pool of great arrangements that I just haven\u0027t had time to share with you. I have even more ideas that I haven\u0027t arranged yet, and that list keeps getting longer. There are so many genres that are important to me and I want to cover them all, more \u003cstrong\u003eclassical, rock, pop and metal, film music, video game music\u003c/strong\u003e, and beyond. I\u0027ve even got some unhatched plans for full cover albums, and at the forefront of that list is a \u003cstrong\u003eLegend of\u00a0Zelda Album.\u003c/strong\u003e I am just dying for a chance to bring something like that to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut wait, there\u0027s more! I have also had \u003cstrong\u003eoriginal material\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0on the backburner for a few years, and haven\u0027t yet had the opportunity to give it the attention it deserves. Your support would not only allow me to keep a stream of covers coming, but could give me the space I need to deliver \u003cstrong\u003ean EP of\u00a0my own songs\u003c/strong\u003e, and then who knows where I can go from there. If I can make playing for you into my full time job, I could even consider \u003cstrong\u003etouring\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eplaying live\u003c/strong\u003e, which for a long time has been something I have only dreamed of being able to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out my page, and remember - the harp is for everyone, not just for fairies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmy x\u003cbr\u003e"
