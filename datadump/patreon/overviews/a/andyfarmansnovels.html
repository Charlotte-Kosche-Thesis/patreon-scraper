    "summary": "Who am ? I am English, quite ordinary, and from a middle-class family. As a boy I read a phenomenal amount of biographies, histories, and fiction. E.E Doc Smith, Robert A. Heinlein, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Asimov, Bradbury, Louis L\u0027amour,\u00a0 J.T Edson, James Webb, Desmond Bagley, George MacDonald Fraser, Alistair MacLean, to name but a few, so I was well read as regard Science Fiction, Westerns, War Stories, Spy Thrillers, and action and adventure, in general.\u003cbr\u003eSomewhat to my parents despair, I preferred reading all of the above to that of school books, given that my parents are practical, hard working people, believers in education and duty, who brought up their children to believe in those qualities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have delivered newspapers in the rain, sleet, and snow in order to supplement my pocket money, which I also had to do chores to earn. I have waited tables, served behind a pub bar, served my country on operations wearing camouflage gear, directed traffic in rain, sleet, and snow, while wearing police blue, and carried out surveillance on drug dealers, street robber, and suspected killers, whilst posing as a vagrant. I have organised the policing of royal events, prime ministerial visits, the largest Latin American carnival parade in Europe, and the tiniest carnival parades for the smallest kindergartens in town. I wore several hats at once and somewhere in all of that, I was also the contingency planner for major disasters that may befall a large piece of London, and also enjoyed the excellent, free of charge, outside catering supplied by the Film and TV industry, as the police liaison for six years. Fortunately, I also did distance running, so the calories did not protrude over my belt.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn those final six years of my service I wrote an awful lot operation plans and contingency protocols, but these days I write fiction, all action and adventure based. \u003cbr\u003eMy second book series began as a short story, one that was written during an extremely boring meeting at Buckingham Palace in 2005, and it stayed a short story until after I had completed the writing of the alternative history series,\u00a0\u003cem\u003e\u0027Armageddon\u0027s Song\u0027,\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eall 669k+ words of it, in 2015.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027Armageddon\u0027s Song\u0027\u003c/em\u003e, is about World War 3 at the turn of the millennium, and it took two and a half years to write all five volumes. \u003cbr\u003eVolume 4, \u003cem\u003e\u0027The Longest Night\u0027, \u003c/em\u003eand Volume 5, \u003cem\u003e\u0027Crossing the Rubicon\u0027\u003c/em\u003e, were Amazon best sellers in Australia and the UK.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-H-YO39cHToI/WqJxySt7jNI/AAAAAAAACDg/OEVEisA0zFkoV1929dYS5ea-2ln-SutRgCLcBGAs/s640/AS%2BBanner.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-d_UiHrIXEsY/UbdRvxDK61I/AAAAAAAAAFg/dzUbBDSVPT4/s1600/Blogitem01.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Cover: \u0027Stand-To\u0027, by Andy Farman)\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u00a0Unlike Tom Clancy\u0027s excellent Red Storm Rising, \u003cem\u003eArmageddon\u0027s Song\u003c/em\u003e is a tale of a truly global war, and one where the central characters are not just American, they come from many NATO countries as well as Australia, Pakistan, and The Philippines. \u003cbr\u003eBecause, \u0027The Other Side\u0027, is also made up of ordinary men and women who are doing their duty, the story also follows the fortunes of characters in the resurgent Warsaw Pact, and their allies, The People\u0027s Republic of China. \u003cbr\u003eCharacters are the core of a story.
