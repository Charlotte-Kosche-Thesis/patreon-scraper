No one believes their lies anymore. The Internet leveled the playing field. It allowed small independent truth-seeking media, like Activist Post, to compete in the marketplace of ideas. Turns out, peace and freedom are popular. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey lost their grip on reality and they want it back. Although the establishment media\u0027s attempt to label their competiton as \"fake news\" totally backfired in the public, they were able to convince Google, Facebook and others to take action through censorship and de-monetization.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs many of you know, we have been on every ridiculous \"fake news\" list, including some that accused us of being Russian propaganda (which we jokingly\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.activistpost.com/2016/11/activist-post-admits-russian-propaganda.html\"\u003eadmit to here\u003c/a\u003e).

Both of which we had been using for some time. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eRevenue from those sources is off by 60%.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGoogle:\u003cbr\u003eThe rep\u00a0said our \"domain is no longer approved by Google ad exchange.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom Amazon: \u003cbr\u003e\"After careful review, we have decided not to approve your website activistpost.com for the Amazon CPM Ads program as it does not meet the terms of the Associates Program Operating Agreement. As a result, we will not serve ads from Amazon CPM Ads on this website. Any earnings you\u2019ve accrued for Amazon CPM Ads served to this site will be paid in accordance with the terms of the Associates Program Operating Agreement.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe pride ourselves on being self-sustaining with voluntary ads because begging for donations is not our style. Sticking to principles and offering massive value is our style. Yet as they reduce ways to make money, we need your support more than ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are the reason we exist.
