In the past i have been doing commissions on an unregular basis due to the fact that i simply dont have the free time to offer commissions on a regular basis. Your pledge will help to push me to produce more and better artwork than ever. \u003cbr\u003eThe money collected from these pledges will also be used to commission other talented artists for more great artwork for all of us to enjoy as well as helping to aquire new hardware and software to enhance my efficiency and the quality of my artwork and streams.\u003cbr\u003eThe frequency of new art uploads will still highly depend on the ammount of free time at hand, but i will aim to on average produce one complete piece of art per month at least.\u003cbr\u003e"
