Right now, I pay my living expenses with animation work, commissions \u00a0advertising and freelance jobs. Each one of those eats up a huge chunk of my life. That\u0027s time I could be using to make more comics and other free content for you lovely people. More is better I\u0027m told. More cake is always better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter working in the animation industry for over 6 years I felt the need to create something that was truly of my mind and share it with the world (I\u0027m sorry).\u00a0I started ARG! in may of 2011 as a semi autobiographical experiment. It then snowballed into the nerd humor comic about a couple facing their impending adulthood and all the nerdy hilarity and horror that ensues. It\u0027s been the main creative focus in my life for the last 4 years and it\u0027s all thanks to a tremendously awesome group of readers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy becoming a patron you\u0027ll be making it easier for me to shift my focus into making more \u003cstrong\u003efree content for all.\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027ve had projects lined up and ready to go for years now and this is the opportunity to see them born.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on your contribution you\u0027ll be given exclusive access to pre-production sketches, unused comics, first in line for special merchandise offers, access to a monthly drink and draw stream, commissions and various other works. These are things very few people get to see and I\u0027m opening it up to patrons. I really want to make my Patreon feed the best place to get all the extra content I create and create a space where I can bounce ideas and showcase new things to you good looking folks.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eSo I have to pay to read the comic now?\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0 No no no. Fear not!\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eARG! as it is today, will always be free and updated.\u003c/strong\u003e I just want to make more free stuff and offer some incentives to those that wish help me out.\u00a0I hope that with your help we can make ARG and all the other things I create even better. Thank you for considering becoming a patron. CHEERS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
