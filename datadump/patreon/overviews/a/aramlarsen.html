I begin by honing in on the form, finding the lines that express its volume, its particular curves, its movement and gesture.

We seem to carry the seed of all these things in us and art is my way of considering this commonality and tapping in to the sense of unity we gain from that vision.\u003c/em\u003e\"\u003cbr\u003e"

He has been at the canvas since age sixteen, exploring abstract composition with his mentor, Grass Valley, CA painter Menlo Macfarlane. He continues to study perspective and the science of color with friend and collaborator, Reese Sutfin. His figurative work is often from imagination or loosely based on figure drawings from modeling sessions. The human form remains Larsen\u2019s natural point of entry into his investigation of the homologous bodies of humans and animals. Larsen has had solo and group shows in San Francisco, Santa Fe and Vancouver and lives in Nevada City, California and Vancouver, BC.",
