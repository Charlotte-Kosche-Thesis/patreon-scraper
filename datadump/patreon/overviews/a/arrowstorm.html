    "summary": "Arrowstorm Entertainment has built it\u0027s name on independently produced feature films, primarily in the fantasy and scifi genres. We have made 13 films over the past 3 years, and are the world leaders in filmed fantasy content. Our past films include: \u003cem\u003eDawn of the Dragonslayer, The Crown and the Dragon, Osombie, Orc Wars, The Shadow Cabal, Survivor, Zombie Hunter\u003c/em\u003e and the \u003cem\u003eMythica\u003c/em\u003e series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.arrowstormentertainment.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i58.tinypic.com/w8qia9.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the medium is changing... people\u0027s viewing habits are changing, the way we consume media is changing, the devices we watch media on are changing, and the way we tell stories can change to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what we at Arrowstorm want to do, is tell our unique stories in a new kind of way. We have been successful in the past at building interesting world\u0027s and compelling characters - and that\u0027s not going to change... but the format will. We want to tell those same compelling character stories in about 3 minute segments - vignettes that tell an overarching story week by week, but come in bite-sized chunks perfect for mobile devices, and consuming on the go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example of a short we made in the past, which so inspired us that we made a feature version. This is the kind of story we want to continue telling, and your support can make it possible:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/y3UA-rBiJt8\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo -- follow us into this brave new world :) We\u0027ll still keep making films, of course. And television. But this short form story-telling is an exciting new venture, and true to our indie roots, we won\u0027t shy from the challenge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY WE NEED YOU\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur films are expensive to make... they feature high-end costumes, art, and effects, all created from scratch by the artists we employ to help bring our vision to life. While indie feature films have a market-place, and can sometimes recoup their costs, short content generally doesn\u0027t. It is made purely out of passion for the story, characters and medium... That\u0027s why we need your support to allow us to pursue this dream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW DOES PATREON WORK?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e - You pledge an amount of money that you will be charged per video (eg. $1)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0- That money is not charged, unless we release a video to you... For instance, we might give you an exclusive look at a scene from the upcoming Mythica films.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0- When we have enough backers to reach a goal (eg. $2,000 per video worth of backers), we will produce one of our goal videos... eg. a new scifi or fantasy series.\u003cbr\u003e - If you hate our videos, or just can\u0027t afford it anymore, you can cancel your pledge at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u0027s a few answers to possible FAQ\u0027s:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. We will try to release 2 to 4 videos per month... no more, so don\u0027t worry about being inundated with charges.\u003cbr\u003e2. We will only release new and exciting content as \"paid\" Patreon-supported videos. This may include scenes from unreleased films, new short-format stories (the real purpose of this site) and exclusive Behind-The-Scenes content.\u003cbr\u003e3. We will continue to release a bunch of videos to the public, as per usual.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCheck out our website for more info on us, and our past work:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.arrowstormentertainment.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.arrowstormentertainment.com\u003c/a\u003e"
