    "summary": "I am Alekz Londos, owner of Advanced Disaster Relief. I live near the ocean in Santa Cruz,\nCalifornia in the USA. I have 16 years of experience as a photojournalist.\nAfter being a witness to so much destruction, death, mass suffering, and failed\nhumanitarian responses, I was driven to make a difference and became involved\nin emergency services. I have independently provided international disaster\nrelief support and immediate medical care to critical areas before the military\nand multinational organizations arrived. I have done search and rescue, body\nrecovery, psychological debriefing, debris removal, risk mitigation, and\nrebuilt infrastructures. I focus my mission objectives on benefitting humanity\nand our environment. I then write inspiring stories and utilize mass media to\nhelp raise awareness and compassion towards tragic events.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI began my career working for major TV news stations in Reno,\nNevada before becoming an independent, freelance photojournalist in 2002. My\nimages have been featured on CNN, NBC, CBS, FOX, ABC, KSBW, Associated Press\n(AP), World News (WN), Philippine National News, and many other news outlets. I\nhave been published in newspapers 34 times: The Huffington Post, San Francisco\nChronicle, LA Times, Aptos Times, Santa Cruz Sentinel, Mercury News, Reno\nGazette Journal, Santa Cruz Good Times, and Reno News \u0026amp; Review. I have been\ninterviewed by Anonymous (the international cyber hacking group) as well as\nKSCO, KTOK, and KRXA radio stations.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI took a variety of courses at Cabrillo College in 2008 and\nyears later had accumulated 81 units. I mostly studied emergency medical\ntraining, environmental science, horticulture, sustainability, and renewable\nenergy and resources, all of which I could apply to my career. I completed the\nRed Cross course in Santa Cruz and become a disaster relief volunteer in 2009.\nI also completed the Community Emergency Response Teams (CERT) course at the\nFelton Fire Station in 2010. I now consider myself a hybrid photojournalist,\nenvironmentalist, humanitarian, and activist.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI self-deployed to hazmat cleanups, lightning storms,\nwildfires, floods, sinkholes, landslides, snowstorms, car accidents, and a\ncommuter train crash. I was in New Orleans during the aftermath of Hurricane\nKatrina and the Philippines during the aftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan. I\nhave been through three other hurricanes as well: Gustav in 2008, as well as\nIsaac and Sandy in 2013. I also went tornado chasing in Oklahoma in 2013. I was\nin Ghana during the peak of the Ebola Outbreak in 2014. I volunteered in Nepal\nduring the earthquake aftermath of 2015. I lived in the epicenter for a month\non my own while treating medical patients and helping the community recover. I\nwent to Erbil, Iraq in 2016, where I brought supplies to the Peshmerga\nmilitary, distributed medical aid to the clinics, and volunteered in Syrian\nrefugee camps.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThroughout my missions, I have been a witness to the\nunimaginable, widespread destruction of catastrophic man-made and natural\ndisasters. I\u2019ve seen things from a perspective that most people have not. I am\nextremely saddened by the egotism, greed, and lack of compassion by both people\nand corrupt corporations that are contributing to the destructive impact of\nindustrialized nations. In this moment, we are all witnessing the rapid\ndisruption and alteration of our planet\u2019s biosphere and we are still carelessly\nwasting resources and destroying the Earth\u0027s fragile ecosystems. The exponential\nrate of man-made climate change is the collective result of our selfish,\nrepetitive actions, our over-consuming society, and profit-based, consumerist\nworld economy wasting resources and destroying our Earth\u0027s fragile ecosystems.\nInherently, we have the responsibility to take initiative in being accepting\nand supportive of our transition towards an ecologically-sustainable global\nsociety.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI began writing my book \"Resource Guide to Solve Urgent\nGlobal Issues\" in 2008, when immediate global action became apparent. This\nis an educational text of my knowledge, experience and yet another desperate\nattempt of mine to present society with compelling solutions to the challenges\nwe all face. This document details a wide range of subjects that will not only\nbenefit those working in emergency services and government-appointed positions,\nbut also the general public. The document is decipherable in 91 written\nlanguages on the website page with a built-in English audiobook reader. The English\nMP3 and English PDF download is also available. The 6X9 inch paperback book is 200 pages with 167\ncharts, graphs and extraordinary color pictures. \u003ca href=\"http://advanceddisasterrelief.com/resource-guide.html\"\u003ehttp://advanceddisasterrelief.com/resource-guide....\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome past accomplishments:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I have given speech presentations to groups, clubs, middle\nschool, and college classes in efforts of further inspiring people.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I have co-organized a March Against Monsanto protest and\nbeach cleanup projects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I am the founder of the controversial event \u201cSanta Cruz\nChalked-Up,\u201d which distributed thousands of sticks of side-walk chalk downtown\nfor activist, artistic, and community interaction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I am the designer of two legendary bike parks in Capitola,\nCalifornia: Oz and Brommer Street Bike Jump Park.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I released a documentary in 2000 that had taken me seven\nyears to film, edit, direct, and produce. It is called PSYCHOSiiS Version 2.4.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I summited Mount Whitney in 2007. The summit elevation is 14,505\nfeet above sea level.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I organized a holiday toy drive at a popular music venue in\n2008. I had contracted ten major sponsors that each made large contributions.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I established my company, Advanced Disaster Relief, in 2013.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I independently organized a \u201cMass Tire Removal Project\u201d in\n2013 after discovering hundreds of illegally dumped (deteriorating) tires. They\nwere located in a creek ravine in the Santa Cruz Redwood Forest. I acquired\npermission from the county and recruited 30 amazing volunteers through\nFacebook. Together we removed over 1000 tires (within only 5 days) to be\ndisposed of correctly. We later found out they had been there for 35 years.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I was involved with the production of an inspiring music\nvideo in 2015. It was produced to thank the world for their help during the\naftermath of Super Typhoon Haiyan. It was written, sung, and produced by Jim\nParedes. The images used in the video were all of what I had captured while\nvolunteering in the Philippines. It has 105k Facebook shares with millions of\nviews!! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 I filmed, edited, directed, and produced a 9-minute\nenvironmental public service announcement in 2016. It covers consumerism,\npollution, fire prevention, and global warming. It is uploaded to my Facebook\npage, my YouTube page, and often airs on community TV.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI would love to reach $1000 per month. This will further support my international\nhumanitarian missions and creative environmental project ideas!!\u003ca href=\"http://advanceddisasterrelief.com/resource-guide.html\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://advanceddisasterrelief.com/resource-guide.html\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"

Thank you! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI created this Patreon page for those who continue to value what I offer society and would like to further support my work. Like most people, the only thing limiting my full potential\u2026 is money. This page allows members to donate $1 or more monthly. This will help me offset community outreach project expenses: equipment, supplies, educational materials, travel costs, etc. There are many musicians, artists and authors that receive over $25,000 a month on this site and I\u0027m here trying to save the human race. If I reach $1000 per month, I can then focus my full attention on helping both people and the environment rather than wasting away my life making money to do these projects. \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/AlekzLondos\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/AlekzLondos\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour monthly donation is greatly appreciated.
