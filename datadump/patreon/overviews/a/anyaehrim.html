At least, that is the personality complex of Lee Raywick, the white-haired, divined child of pastor Lucas Williams\u0027 new-age religion, Reunificationism. Born within the Raywick Church\u0027s walls, he is raised both sheltered and caged while being abusively conditioned into believing he is the reincarnation of Christ, or, as Lucas coins him, the Re-un (ending up being said as Rune by followers nationwide). As Lee ages, memorizes the Bible front to back for recitations and sermons, he learns of the world outside the church which he is told he can never touch or know. Lee senses a disconnection between him and his teachings; who is a savior who has no idea what he\u0027s saving others from? Why can\u0027t he go outside? Lucas says it would taint his soul, and so he stays, bored, malnourished, and dying for knowledge so to become the truth of what he preaches from the pulpit--that he truly is God.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eBut it is a lie.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tLee feels like a lie.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAlone and unloved, the pastor\u0027s attention the only source of guidance in his life which he tries to live up to, Lee tries repeatedly, in vain, to be the Rune of the Church of Raywick so to feel purpose, and satisfaction of which both are impossible to obtain without experience. Lee subconsciously knows this, and he feels he is failing, always, but his insistence and doubts go unheard and untolerated by the pastor, leaving Lee bruised, indignant, and self-insecure of his own intuition.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tConcept of love, the very thing he preaches others to feel yet unable to feel himself, is thrust upon him one day by a generous and caring nun. The confusion of such sentimentality toward Lee as a child, and not Rune as the resurrection of God, begins to unravel his self-awareness revealing that both his mental and physical realities are warped out of his control.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eHe finds both time and space are not on his side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI joined Patreon to take \u003cstrong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/scottsantens\"\u003eScott Santens\u0027s\u003c/a\u003e Patreon Pledge\u003c/strong\u003e. If I earn more than $1000/per month, I have pledged to put excess earnings toward other patrons - likely other struggling artists and environmentalists taking the same pledge. To be honest, I think $12,000/year is more than enough to live. $12,000/year would also be sufficient to supplement my fiance\u0027s income, and give him more time to do his own artwork, which is metalwork/blacksmithing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv\u003e\n\tScott Santens himself is a very proactive writer, and a prominent, well-learned figure in the Basic Income movement. He\u0027s already over his pledge goal, so he\u0027s already diverting his excess to the Pledgers. He is my first and longest. I feel guilty and proud about it, and often post his content on my Facebook. You should go check him out. You\u0027d help him so much by carrying him along his journey and supporting his Pledge experiment here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eAs far as Basic Income\u003c/strong\u003e, it is about providing every individual, regardless of status or earnings, a structural financial foothold. He recently \u003ca href=\"http://www.scottsantens.com/how-to-reform-welfare-and-taxes-to-provide-every-american-citizen-a-basic-income\"\u003ewent into staggering depth on how to pay for it\u003c/a\u003e. For me, I\u0027d just be glad if no one is ever forced into destitution anymore. I\u0027ve seen and felt the precipice far too well to know it is terrifying and should be avoided at all costs if we truly want a stable society in the environmentally-threatened technological age.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
