Scherman, and I am an animator, and illustrator residing in Southern California. \u00a0Currently I\u0027m focusing on maintaining studio employment as a character designer and storyboard artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a generous handful of personal dream projects that I\u0027d LOVE to get off the ground, including a graphic novel/webcomic, getting an art book of sketches and illustrations published, and a musical solo project as well. \u00a0I plan on integrating each of these into one solid concept. \u00a0The comic that I have been developing itself, is an epic fantasy story in the vein of Jim Henson, Jeff Smith, French comics, 80\u0027s sword and sorcery, and early Don Bluth films, which blends sweeping, whimsical fantasy with classical animated appeal. \u00a0I plan on composing a score as a companion piece to it. \u00a0I also plan on producing full, hand drawn 2-D animation for it as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve fallen on some hard times lately, and the dream of making these projects is becoming more distant each day. \u00a0Affording rent, groceries, paying off school loans, and keeping consistent work in my career is a full time commitment, and my free time is swallowed up as a result. \u00a0Your support can help me bring my world and ideas to life, and use what little time I have to make this dream a reality. \u00a0fans of old school fantasy and classic animation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re fans of old school fantasy with tons of heart, as well as classical, full animation, this is the perfect opportunity for you to help make it happen! \u00a0I look forward to you guys being a part of this! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Andy",
