    "summary": "Thank you so much for listening to my podcast! \u00a0And thank you even more for checking out this page! \u00a0I\u2019m so excited to launch the Lead Singer Syndrome ALL ACCESS CLUB.  When I started this podcast a year ago, I knew it was something I was passionate about - bringing these incredible backstage conversations I\u2019ve had for over a decade to music fans all over the world.  But what I underestimated at that time was the passion of my future listeners.  My \u201cSynners\u201d have become so immersed in this podcast with me week after week, they want to talk to me about the guests, they want to give me ideas for the show, and they want to talk about the show with other fans.  And for so many fans of the show, with the long commutes, work days and other times they have to listen to LSS, once episode per week and a couple posts on social media just isn\u2019t enough for them. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSo enter the ALL ACCESS CLUB.  Now, for a low monthly fee you can have access to more content, more interaction with me, and also interaction with other fans of the show just like you.  Also, only ALL ACCESS CLUB members will have access to Lead Singer Syndrome merchandise.  I want to make the club as special and as unique as the podcast is.  I want it to be a place for friends to meet, interact and talk about music, performing, and current events.  I\u2019m excited to bring you bonus content not available anywhere else, share my personal story with my fans, and also interact with you guys via video chats and message boards.  I want members to get excited when they get their new patch every 3 months in the mail, and I want everyone to have the opportunity to attend a live Lead Singer Syndrome event. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eBy starting this club, more and more time can be dedicated to the show and it can continue growing getting bigger and bigger and more interesting guests, and more and more additional content, and better produced and better sounding shows.  When I started this a year ago I never thought so many people would stand in solidarity with me and be as passionate about this as I am.  Now a year later, it\u2019s just beginning.  So please, support the show for a small monthly contribution and be a part of this with me.  Thank you so much for listening to this show week after week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeace and Love,\u003cbr\u003eShane Told"
