    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eSo, who am I, and why are we both here?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI always find written introductions a little awkward, which may sound ironic coming from a writer. My name is Glenda Jane Grande, but I have been using the pen name \u003cem\u003eangellusion\u003c/em\u003e since 2006. It has been mostly associated with my poetry, and I first launched my own website in 2009, then later published my first chapbook, \"A Beginning Within An End\" in 2012.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward to 2018 and here we are! I was introduced to the idea of Patreon through an acquaintance. Here, I plan to share my poetry in new ways by incorporating technology with the delivery of my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe dream, goal, and vision\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eLike many writers, the \u003cem\u003edream\u003c/em\u003e is to make a living off writing. However, I am not yet at the stage where I am able to do that. For now, the \u003cem\u003egoal\u003c/em\u003e is share my writing with a wider community while putting money towards publishing my next writing project. This includes hiring an editor, finding someone to shoot the front cover, marketing, and of course, a bit towards my own labour. In addition to the goals listed, this is what your patronage will be going towards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond all this, my \u003cem\u003evision\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0is to create poetry that reminds people that it is perfectly acceptable to raw, vulnerable, and emotional. Our emotions teach us so many lessons, and is often our soul trying to communicate with us. However, with the hustle and bustle of our lives, majority tend to forget to listen to the little whispers in their hearts. My poetry seeks to remind people to connect to themselves once again through several stories and scenarios.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eApart from the tier rewards, I will be updating with regular poems, and also lyric video versions of selected work, which will be read by yours truly. There will also be a few prose pieces occasionally.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will also have the privilege of voting for their favourite literary pieces to be included in my next poetry chapbook.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat else is left to say?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA huge \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to everyone! All of this is possible because of you. I will do my best to think of ways to provide benefits to my patrons, and you are always welcome to contact me with suggestions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
