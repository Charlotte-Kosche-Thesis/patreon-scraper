Thanks for finding me here in this wonderful online community for creatives. I am hoping to use this platform to develop and publish \u003cstrong\u003eart books\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Andr\u00e9 Lichtenberg, an artist / photographer born in Brazil and based in the UK. I live with my family in Brighton on the south coast of England.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI find it difficult to pin point exactly what I do, The best way to describe it is as a sort of visual poetry. I like to experiment with the medium of photography and combine it with other art forms such a digital drawing and painting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.photoandre.com/application/files/8115/2603/8332/16.11.hove_beach-1000.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work primarily focuses on contemporary representations of the environment and architecture. I often photograph under the moonlight, I like the peacefulness of creating at night, it helps me to stay connected and see the world under a different light.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy process of creation relates back to my childhood memories. I used to spend many hours a day drawing as a child, creating aerial views of imaginary cities, architecture and landscapes. These days I see my little boy doing the same with dragons \u0026amp; dinosaurs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.photoandre.com/application/files/9915/2536/8442/1-12am-untitled_2-1000.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.photoandre.com/files/4415/0055/6911/W-NY-Rockefeller-1000.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been involved in the industry for the last 25 years. I have a first class degree in Photographic Science and a Masters in Photographic Studies. I spent many years working in travel, editorial and architectural commissions for international clients before focusing in art photography. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2012, I have been developing large scale artworks constructed from hundreds of photographs. The process is unique, personal and very slow, each artwork takes at least a month to be completed. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work has been successful in several international awards, exhibited in many galleries, museums and art fairs and is collected internationally. So far, I have been able to create my work because of the support of amazing collectors, \ngalleries, institutions, art grants and friends.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, the journey of an artist is not as easy as it may look. So I\u0027m asking for your help!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOver the last 10 years, I also kept a two days a week paid work to support the development of my art and my family. Initially I lectured in photography at the University of Westminster in London. Then my role changed to curating / editing / marketing for a UK film company with studios near my home in Brighton. This job finished recently. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, this is why I am here creating a page at Patreon, I\u0027m hoping that with your support I might be able to transform this turning point into an amazing opportunity to develop my art full-time and \u003cstrong\u003estart creating art books\u003c/strong\u003e. I want to keep working on new projects and promote my art to reach the next level to inspire an even wider audience. Hopefully it may lead to a new exhibition somewhere near you, so you can see the large scale pieces in the flesh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMORE ABOUT THE BOOKS\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eSo what will the art books will look like? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell...\u00a0 In one ideal world I would like to create a gorgeous \u003cstrong\u003elimited edition art book\u003c/strong\u003e (between 200 to 500 copies) about my large scale constructed artworks. I would love to collaborate with a designer, invite a prominent author / art commentator to write the introduction, I\u0027ll also write a short essay about the artistic process and have the images be printed in a heavy paper stock with amazing quality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, that is a long shot. More realistically I want to start using this platform to edit and document the many cross sections of my work: images involving moonlight, architecture, rain, landscapes, poetical narratives, etc in smaller experimental and beautiful art books. I\u0027ll intend to invite authors / curators to write the introductions, so that we can create gorgeous physical books that you can collect and I can start approaching and showing to publishers. The plan is to print a new book every 6 months. \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAny help from you will be extremely appreciated. \u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.photoandre.com/application/files/8915/2690/3323/Paris_Nord-1000.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.photoandre.com/files/4014/1051/7933/London-victoria.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n WHAT YOUR SUPPORT MEANS TO ME \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eA very large part of my daily life is spent in money related issues.
