    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a jack of all trades, basically. I\u0027ve embedded myself deep into popular culture now for about 20 years. I\u0027m a cosplayer/costumer, artist, writer, and creator, and a Navy wife. I recently completed my MA in history, and I\u0027m in the process of applying my degree to the field. I feel that keeping history in the realm of prose and graphic fiction, is a way to continue a support of both the liberal and fine arts, and instill a passion for the subject for future generations, despite cuts to education.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn lieu of academic releases that I\u0027m currently working on, including some research on cotton cultivation in Medieval Anatolia (riveting, I know), I am finally completing the sequel to my first book, \u003cem\u003eOf Summer and Winter,\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0now that my education is complete. I\u0027m also working with a friend of mine, Richard Lockett, on creating a new online comic by the name of \u003cem\u003eLucid, \u003c/em\u003e(more on that later!), and, more excitedly, drafting the beginning plans to transform the\u003cem\u003e Alexiad \u003c/em\u003eby Anna Komnene into a series of floppies and graphic novels based on events within the book. Some preliminary artwork of that has already been done.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe biggest hurdle I have right now is that I am magnficently underemployed, as silly as that sounds. And while employment is within grasp, the US Navy currently has other plans for my husband and I, which is making it difficult for us to put down real roots so I can obtain proper employment in my field. A museum professional is not \u00a0a \"portable career\" according to the Department of Defense standard, therefore, finding support for employment is difficult while we\u0027re going to be bounced from port to port for the next few years. This wasn\u0027t our choice, this is a result of the needs of the Navy, and is entirely out of my husband\u0027s control. While we aren\u0027t starving, or really in desperate need of money, it has put a minor financial burden on us while my student loans have gone into repayment, and I\u0027ve started a rigorous post-graduate certificate at one of the local universities that I have to pay out of pocket for, but is necessary to ensure I stay qualified when I can finally get my foot in the door at a museum.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe pledges from this page will be providing me wiggle room financially to ensure that these projects, and more, can be completed. The sequel to my book had a successful Kickstarter campaign, and those funds are being directly used to support that project, this is just a way to make sure my supplies are paid for, and my tech stays operational, while \u00a0we wait on orders for the next big adventure.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut in reality, you\u0027ll probably just be supporting my coffee habit."
