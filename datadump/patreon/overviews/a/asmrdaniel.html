    "summary": "Hey There! I\u0027m Daniel, I\u0027m 20 years old, and am an ASMRtist on Youtube! Welcome to my Patreon! I create some amazing ASMR content, ranging from trigger assortments to unboxings, and even to specialist sounds designed to make you relax, and to give you some ASMR tingles! The reason I have a patreon is purely to develop better quality and new ASMR on a regular basis! Any money I make from Patreon will go directly into buying new equipment, whether that be microphones, cameras, props, or items to make sounds with, the money will be going directly into the channel, and it is the only reason I have started up a patreon! The page is here so that you guys can join me on an amazing ASMR journey, and get some personalised ASMR content whilst you\u0027re at it!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll the reward tiers are based on my favourite triggers, the higher the reward tier the more I LOVE that trigger sound! Maybe you agree! All rewards will be given once the first months payment has been taken and you have been pledged for that month. All items in the reward columns which are in bold are new to that tier, and were not in the lower tier before it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis page is also here so that you guys can all give me some more ideas and suggestions for sounds and videos to bring to the channel! I love to experiment with new relaxing sounds and items, and so I welcome any suggestions or thoughts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love making the content that I do, and I want to make sure that everybody who watches my content enjoys it too. I couldn\u0027t make the videos I do without all the support you guys give me, and I will forever be in your debt. Relaxing videos are the least I could do for all your love and generosity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Daniel \u0026lt;3"
