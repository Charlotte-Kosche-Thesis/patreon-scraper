Ever since I was little I was always a natural at art, but was never encouraged to follow those dreams at a young age. As I grew up I learned that I can make a living doing what I loved and did whatever I could to become a full-time artist. With the support of my loved once, I know I\u0027ll persevere, and I want to thank everyone who believed in me along the way.\u003cbr\u003eI eventually want to continue doing this in Washington, though at the moment I don\u0027t have the funds for it, so hopefully this will help get me where I want to be.",
