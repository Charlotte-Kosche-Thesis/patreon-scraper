I\u0027m currently best known for my young adult series, the award winning\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.jessowen.com/test-1/#new-page-44\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSummer King Chronicles\u003c/a\u003e (let\u0027s call it SKC from here on out), and I am working on more stories set in that world . . . and beyond. My short fiction has appeared in Cricket Magazine for young readers, as well as various anthologies. I\u0027m a proud member of Authors of the Flathead, the Society for Children\u0027s Book Writers and Illustrators, and the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Are You on Patreon, Jess?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIn 2012, I chose to self-publish my novels for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is creative control. It has been an amazing experience! It does come with some financial challenges, however. Traditionally published authors frequently see an advance to give them some monetary cushion while they work on their next project--indie authors have to get creative while they wait for book royalties.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have run four successful campaigns on Kickstarter to fund hardback print runs of my debut series, and I enjoy the crowdfunding atmosphere, interaction, and community mindset. I love making things that enrich the story world for my readers--it\u0027s some of the most rewarding work I do. That said, my ideas outrun my budget and my time to be able to do all the things I want to do. Patreon is a wonderful way for the community to help me create lots of new exciting content while still paying for little things like a mortgage and dog food. (Sparks thanks you. You can see his doofy appreciation and adventures\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/authorjessowen\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eon my Instagram\u003c/a\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are You Offering Patrons?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eCurrently, the monthly content will be fun posts from me, sneak peaks at the graphic novel we\u0027re funding, writing tips and prompts, dog pictures, and other delightful randomness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope as this grows I\u0027ll be able to commit more time to the Patreon community, offering writing critique or little tutorial and workshop packages. That\u0027s all up to you, the Patrons! If I have enough income to let go some hours at work, I can put that time to work for you. Let\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is An Experiment!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eRemember too that sometimes the only way to find out if something works is to try it. I\u0027m going to try different types of reward tiers and different content. I\u0027ll see what\u0027s actually do-able, or if it takes too much of my time from writing books. Hopefully this will give you a chance to get extra stories and art, and give me a chance to maybe take a few hours away from the day job every week to be more productive creatively.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFinally, I tried to anticipate some questions you might have:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat The Heck is Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThink of it like a subscription . . . to me! You pay monthly, whatever amount you\u0027d like, to have access to all the fun things I hope to offer.
