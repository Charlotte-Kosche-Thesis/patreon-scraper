I am a freelance translator/editor/podcaster/webmaster living in Kyushu, Japan with my wife and 2 kids.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started this site with the idea of helping ALTs in Japan have more fun. Initially, my focus was on specific ways that ALTs can make the most of their time in Japan, doing things like staying out of the Teacher\u2019s Room, and using some lessons and games I\u2019d put together in my previous ALT experience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, over the three years of the site\u2019s life and my own career changes, I\u2019ve expanded to cover every aspect of living and working in Japan. I\u2019ve added a weekly podcast, webinars, a JET Facebook Group, and a working-in-Japan Discord server to the ALT Insider suite of offerings.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.altinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/dIzkqGq.jpg\"\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe vast majority of the content on ALTInsider.com is free, and will continue to be free. The podcasts, the articles, the 3-point SOP reviews, the discord, the webinars, these will always be completely free of charge, forever.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, as my life commitments have increased, the time I need to spend generating income has also increased. This means that my focus gets yanked away from ALTInsider.com and into less exciting, more profitable translation work.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEvery dollar you donate will allow me to scale back on my translation work, so that I can spend more time on the many avenues I mentioned above to continue to help people working in Japan have fun.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want this site to be a place where everyone, no matter where they are in their life, can get timely support and advice, whether it be from a podcast interview, a webinar, a chat on discord, or just an email.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading and remember, have more fun.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.altinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hTyTnUi.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"http://www.altinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hTyTnUi.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e"
