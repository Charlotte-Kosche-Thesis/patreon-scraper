    "summary": "I am getting a start in the music world as a teacher and a pianist. I have been a performer my whole life and am a believer that good music needs to be shared. Patreon is a great way for me to connect more with other musicians and enthusiasts alike and use those connections as part of my inspiration for creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u0027t know what Patreon is or how it works check out there FAQ page. Otherwise here\u0027s a brief description of what I do and how you can help me do what I love. The short story of Patreon is that it is a website that allows you to support your favorite artists and musicians and others who choose to work independently. It basically allows you to pay your favorite creator to continue doing what they love. For me, I joined Patreon and YouTube because for where I live it is an opportunity to put my music out into the Internet void. Also where I live, it\u0027s not exactly easy to busk with a piano or keyboard so this is one way that I have found to get music out and to connect with other creators\u003cbr\u003eI think I\u0027ve said this before but on this page you will find various covers of songs from movies, the radio, Broadway, as well as old church hymns and choruses. I have various tiers set up on the side that you can browse through and find the one that fits your budget. You can also back out of it at any time so there\u0027s no pressure. How great is that?!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by my page and enjoy the music!\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Hello!\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon page! I\u0027m so glad you\u0027ve stopped in. I am a pianist and teacher currently residing in Canada. I\u0027ve been playing music since the age of 4 and am constantly figuring out new ways to share my love of music with others. I have a strong religious background and that has heavily influenced my style of music and playing. I\u0027m also classically trained (why I did not major in music in university is a mystery to me; maybe I\u0027ll do that for the second degree...). Anyway. On this page you will find updates on what I\u0027m doing musically both locally in my current hometown and on the web. I don\u0027t know if I can describe my musical style but you will likely here evidence of the classical as well as the stereotypical \"church music chord\" progressions (usually 1,4,5,6,1 progression) or some variation. The page is currently undergoing some changes so stay tuned and thanks for reading. :)\u003cbr\u003eIn my spare time I\u0027m usually practicing...or sewing/knitting, baking/cooking, or doing any number of outdoorsy things like biking or skating, etc...\u003cbr\u003eCheck out some of the adventures on Instagram: alissamusic321 :)",
