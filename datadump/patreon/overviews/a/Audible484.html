I\u0027ve had lots of ups and downs in my online career and i\u0027ve learned alot. Now with more time and energy being put into making better and more frequent content I am hoping to finally accomplish my dream of supporting my family with my art. This video goes into a lot more detail:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gdjn4UYg1ZI\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo a little about me. I\u0027m from Southern California, born and raised. I\u0027m 26 years old and a proud father of 2 little girls and husband to 1 lovely lady. I have a YouTube channel with everything from stories about past drug experiences and what I learned to my music which is a big passion of mine to mini-documentary style videos about interesting topics to so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal on YouTube is to be honest about things even when they\u0027re ugly in hopes that someone can learn from it and make better decisions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy what I do and would love to make it a full time career. I\u0027m hoping with your help I can do what I love and also support my family while also creating great and frequent content for you guys. I\u0027m just figuring this Patreon thing all out as of now but I will definitely be learning as much as I can. I appreciate you.
