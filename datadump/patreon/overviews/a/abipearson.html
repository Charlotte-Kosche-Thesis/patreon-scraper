    "summary": "To put it simply I\u0027m a writer and poet.  I spend my time stringing words together trying change the world little by little with what I say. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been writing since I was 10 years old, but it wasn\u0027t until high school that I really fell in love with writing. I was homeschooled all my life and my family moved around a lot; because of this writing quickly became my outlet and a way to express myself. In 2016 I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and mild depression. Recovering and learning how to live my life has been a process, but it was then that I decided to jump wholeheartedly into my writing.\u00a0 Writing, storytelling, music and art, all of these have made my life worth living. They make me smile and get up in the morning.\u00a0 Making a living off of writing is now a dream of mine, and through Patreon hopefully that dream will come true.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I\u0027ve written\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/What-All-Means-Red-Collection/dp/151719072X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books\u0026amp;ie=UTF8\u0026amp;qid=1454963601\u0026amp;sr=1-1\u0026amp;keywords=what+it+all+means+-+the+red+collection\"\u003ea short story collection\u003c/a\u003e with my partner around the themes of life and death, love and hate, guilt, regret, honor, and loss.

The downside is he will be unable to work as much as he usually does and I have yet to find a job outside the home. Being able to make $575 through patreon will allow us to pay rent and stay in our apartment and it will greatly ease my anxiety.\u00a0",
