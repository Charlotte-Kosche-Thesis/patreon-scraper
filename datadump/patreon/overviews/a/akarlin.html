It is therefore perhaps high time for them to stop and ponder, as the shelf life of every new Russophobe meme seems to decrease month by month. Arguably, there has been no\u00a0greater need for the sort of detailed, data-centered Russia analysis that I offer since the 1980s. This year, I will focus on writing\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eDark Lord of the Kremlin\u003c/strong\u003e, which seeks to analyze and deconstruct the most common Western media myths about Russia.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://akarlin.com/russophile/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThough I began as a Russia blogger, my interests soon extended well beyond the Eurasian carapace, into topics such as geopolitics, human biodiversity (HBD), psychometrics, and futurism/transhumanism.

Since then, the exponentially growing body of evidence for those positions, including the publication of high profile books by \u201crespectable\u201d authors such as Nicholas Wade and Garett Jones, has vindicated my arguments.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://akarlin.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/karlin-psychometric-research-300x296.jpg\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eSince then I have made several significant contributions to the debate, including uncovering the (remarkably good) scores for mainland China in PISA 2009 and detailed regional data for Russia.

Or to put it another way, this project will fuse Charles Murray\u2019s insights on the centrality of IQ to social and economic success within the US, and Garrett Jones\u2019 analogous observations as concerns international development, and extend it into the deep past as well as the 21st century.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere are two articles from the past couple of years I which I outline the main ideas of the book:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.unz.com/akarlin/intro-apollos-ascent/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eIntroduction to Apollo\u2019s Ascent\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.unz.com/akarlin/ancient-greeks-not-geniuses/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Ancient Greeks Weren\u2019t All Geniuses\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a very largescale and ambitious overtaking, but understanding the role intelligence plays in economic and technological progress \u2013 and stagnation \u2013 has never been more vital in light of current developments in CRISPR and the genetics of IQ that will make \u201ctest tube\u201d eugenics feasible in as little as a decade, as well as mounting concerns over the prospect of AI \u201csuperintelligence.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e"
