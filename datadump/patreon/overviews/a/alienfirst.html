I live in the Pacific Northwest, making art and drinking coffee.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do a good many art related things, from personal work, to art for conventions, Bunday (a bunny for your Sunday), teaching art to teenagers, and most recently, developing two different webcomics. I adore creating interesting characters and beasties, along with drawing cute to creepy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSupporting this Patreon will get you, primarily, access to work I won\u0027t be posting anywhere else. \u00a0Things that could be coming your way:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAccess to supporter only posts containing sneak peaks at current projects, concept work for comics and/or illustration pieces, and written pieces of lore for a currently unnamed comic (lore bits written by my husband, Steven Glover, and occasionally accompanied by small illustrations by me).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSketches and concepts only available to supporters.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEarly posts of comic pages and Bundays.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePersonal sketch requests on a monthly basis.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThe money made through Patreon will help me continue to create art for a living, \u00a0pursue more opportunities for conventions and potential product to sell, as well as to finally get two long standing comic projects from the concept phase to the actual \"comic\" phase (with the additional help from my husband who is the key lore maker and writer for one of those projects).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHere\u0027s a breakdown for what gets posted (reiterated in the rewards side panel):\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFree (just for following and visiting): General art posts.

The only difference for $10 and $25 Patrons is the monthly requests. I have thoughts for making things a bit more special for my $10+ Patrons, but those are still stewing!"
