I strive to add some of that truth and beauty to the world, every day. \u00a0My goal when composing is to touch a person\u0027s spirit, to move them emotionally, to create an effect and start a ripple.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027ve composed for the great majority of my life and consider it to be my highest calling. While I have primarily composed for piano, my works so far include music for film and theater as well as music for a wide variety of solo instruments and ensembles, small and large. \u00a0I very much prefer to compose music with the intention of it being performed by live musicians, rather than being produced by a computer.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow Do I Make A Composition \u003cem\u003ePersonal\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://arthurbreur.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/AHOV-grid-1.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a technique I\u0027ve used for years when I want to compose a piece and make it especially personal: \u003cstrong\u003eI write a word or a name into the music\u003c/strong\u003e, using the letters of that word or name to create the pattern of notes that becomes the melody.
