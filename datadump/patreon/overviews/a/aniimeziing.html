    "summary": "Yo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy name is Jack, or Aniimeziing, and before I do anything else I want to thank you for even considering\nchecking out my page - truly, it means so much that you would be willing to sit\nhere and read my mumbo jumbo so thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically I write, if you want the short version. The longer\nversion if that I have written under the name Aniimeziing on the website\nFanfiction.net for the past 2 years and have been working on a wide variety of\nstories from several different franchises during that time. During this time, I\nhave advanced and grown so much as a writer due to all the feedback I have\nreceived from all those who choose to follow my stories and now I finally feel\nconfident enough to take the next step forwards: to... whatever that next step\nis. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFanfiction is a free service and I will never charge for the\nwork I do or provide on there, this is purely a secondary source. Yes, my\nFanfiction and my interests in Fanfiction will be discussed on my Patreon, but\nnothing will be walled off from those who normally read on Fanfiction.net for\nfree. So, if not that, then why have I made a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, a few reasons. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eFor one, I\u0027m a college student and\ncollege not only sucks up all your time and effort, but it also serves to completely\ndrain you of whatever cash you minghtfind yourself owning whether that be for\nequipment or food or whatever. Currently, I\u0027m stuck with sub-par equipment that\nbarely helps me with that, so writing Fanfiction or my own personal stuff is\ntruly very difficult (my laptop no longer works without being plugged in\nso...). First and foremost, any money I make will be going there, to me buying\nnew equipment so I\u0027ll be able to write more and to a higher quality, as I have\nquite a bit of free time that goes spoilt due to my terrible equipment. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSecond, I want to write as much as I can as often as I can.\nWith Patreon, this can become a source of income for me throughout the year,\nmeaning I do not have to venture to unknown pastures looking for things to\nentertain or find money. It means I can dedicated a larger portion of my free\ntime into actually writing which would just be good for... well everyone at\nthis point. \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThird, I aspire to become a writer in the future. Yea I\nknow, sappy sob story or whatever, but writing is one of the only things I\u0027m\nreally good at and so I want to capitalise on that. I want to not only continue\nto grow and adapt as a Fanfiction writer, but also as a writer of my own stuff,\nof my own stories and novels that I can publish, and that people can\nenjoy. Honestly, that is my dream and with Patreon, I can take a few bounds\nforward towards that dream.\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nNow of course, donating actually requires giving me money...\nwhich is a massive deal. Like insane. So, you would not go home empty handed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor what I plan to offer in return, it ranges: from regular\nwriting tips and guidelines to how I tackle characters or world building or\neven simple symbolism and phrasing, to fully commissioned pieces of writing\nranging from a minimum of 250-2500 words to brainstorming sessions where your\nstory ideas or writing can be discussed 1-to-1 or in a collective chat. My aim\nwith these rewards is to give back to everyone who helps and to give them an\noutlet where they can seek advice or help, just as they are helping me. By\ndonating too you\u0027ll get updates on chapters or stories, giving background\ninformation on any personal ideas I have for stories and the steady progression\nthat has alongside the progression of my Fanfiction and of your own stories. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, thank you once again for reading this, even if you do\nnot donate. Thank you for checking out my page. I hope that you check out some\nof my stuff if you haven\u0027t already, but on that note, I will bid you all adieu.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThanks once more. See ya!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n-Jack\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.fanfiction.net/u/6064531/Aniimeziing\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAniimeziing Fanfiction Account\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
