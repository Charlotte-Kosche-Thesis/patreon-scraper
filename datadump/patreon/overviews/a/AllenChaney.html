    "summary": "Hi! My name is Allen Chaney. Most people know me from my previous work on the Dawn Somewhere youtube channel as a voice actor and creator of \u0027The Allen Hour\u0027 and my current work as a co-host on \u0027Undercooked Analysis\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been taking my cues from a pool of talented horror writers and narrators and branching off on my own to start doing my own original horror. \u00a0My channel \u0027Ignis Purgamentum\u0027 is where I post my own horror work and i\u0027ve been glad to see it is connecting with a few people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat being said, I\u0027d like to be doing more. A LOT more. There are so many projects I have planned and abandoned due to issues of time, equipment, but mostly just generally not having enough money. I\u0027d like to resurrect my podcast \u0027Coffee and Pie\u0027 to release monthly episodes as well as start a new video series that would focus on comedy similar to my previous \u0027Allen Hour\u0027 exploits. I have another series in the works as well, a humorous review series tentatively titled \u0027Things Allen Does and Doesn\u0027t Like\u0027 which I think would be a lot of fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my goal in the next five years to make enough as a creator to leave my day job, this is where you come in. You and your money. Your sweet delicious money. I need new audio equipment. I need a nicer camera. I\u0027m considering taking some classes at JuCo to help me with video and audio editting. I\u0027d like to pay talented artists for logos. I very specifically will NOT blow all this money on alcohol.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, for the first month of this Patreon (And possibly after. We\u0027ll see how this goes) ANYONE who donates me at least 5 bucks will join me in co-writing a story. Not with a group of other people either. You and I will talk one-on-one and I\u0027ll listen to your idea and we\u0027ll work together on forming a coherent story with it. \u00a0Let\u0027s do this! Woo!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMajor props to CF Comer for the banner art. Check out more rad art at\u00a0http://c-f-comer.tumblr.com"
