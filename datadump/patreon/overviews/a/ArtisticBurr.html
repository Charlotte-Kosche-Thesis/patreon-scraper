    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi ! My name is Luis , I\u0027m from Mexico ! and Im \u00a0a silly 15 years old cartoonist bear that loves drawing and dreams to be an animator and cartoonist ! ^^; recently arrived to Patreon ! and also can sell my drawings cause beside the things I like like making Fnaf fanart and any other videogames I like drawing paw and tickle related content , and also get commissioned by other people ! cause I really like the SFW tickling and paw stuff ^^\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ecare to commission me ? O.O Here\u0027s my price sheet ! :\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eI\u0027m aware I updated my prices last month, but thing is: I noticed a few flaws concerning a few commission types. So...since things seem to be going pretty slow right now (I\u0027ve only done 3 in this month), I\u0027ll take the chance to edit and remove some stuff:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Lineart commissions are gone until further notice, as no one has really asked for them.\u003cbr\u003e-Headshots will be replaced with a new commission type: Icons. Why? Because now I\u0027ll be drawing paws as well =3\u003cbr\u003e-The NSFW Content is no longer a category. Instead, I\u0027ll be charging a fee. More about that below.\u003cbr\u003e-Comic Prices had been increased because...they ended up being cheaper than regular commissions, even though the comics involve more work \u0026gt;_\u0026lt;\u003cbr\u003eAll these updates will affect any new commissions I get from now on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. My Rules: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. What I will draw: Clean art, any of the following fetish content: paws, tickling. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. What I might draw: Mature and Adult art, Gore, fetish art that I don\u0027t mind. NSFW art in particular HAS to be discussed. I Will not make \u0027em if they\u0027re THAT gruesomely graphic scene! That can be sort of disgusting to the sight! No violent kinks such as masoquism or rough and rude domination! *Sweating a little...*\u003cbr\u003e(All NSFW content will be uploaded to E621 with my same name ^^ and maybe at Tumblr too if it doesnt got banned out there \u0026gt;_\u0026gt;; )\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. There are 3 commission types available right now. How these work will be explained in section B. \"Commission Types \u0026amp; Prices\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Icons\u003cbr\u003e-Full-Body/Regular Commissions\u003cbr\u003e-Comic Pages\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. All of them share some concepts which concern the coloring of the pic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Flat Colors: Pic has a clean lineart and colors with no shading.\u003cbr\u003e-Shading: Same as before, but this time featuring some basic shading.\u003cbr\u003e-Epic Shading (Shortened as \"Epic\"): Here the shading gets more complex, as I use gradients and highlights to make the transition between lights and shadow more smooth and realistic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Now I\u0027m also bringing up something new into play: Fees. Don\u0027t worry! They aren\u0027t too big \u0026gt;.\u0026lt; It\u0027s just that I wanted to have a set price to add stuff to the pics, instead of having to adapt said price to each level of coloring x_X I think this will make things way more simple~\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Extra Character = $3 per character.\u003cbr\u003e-NSFW = $2 per character involved.\u003cbr\u003e-Background = $3-5. Depends on commmission type how much it is.\u003cbr\u003e-Extra panels = $1 per extra panel. Depends on commission type how many can be added.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eB. Commission Types \u0026amp; Prices: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Full body/Regular Commission\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Flat = $5 for a single character\u003cbr\u003e-Shaded = $8 for a single character\u003cbr\u003e-Epic = $11 for a single character\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*The name says everything!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*How the fees work in this commission type: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Extra characters: You can add up to 5 characters, but this can change based on how much work I have at the time.\u003cbr\u003e-NSFW: You pay $2 per character involved in the kinky stuff.\u003cbr\u003e-Extra panels: You can add up to 6 panels o3o However, these panels can only contain close-ins of the actions you want me to include.\u003cbr\u003e-Backgrounds: You can pay $3 to make me draw a background :o (Eek)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. *NEW* Comics Pages! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Flat = $12\u003cbr\u003e-Shaded = $15\u003cbr\u003e-Epic = $18\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Each page features 2 characters by default, and you get a max of 8 panels to tell your story.\u003cbr\u003e*You can order as many pages as you want per time, just don\u0027t cross the line with a motherfucking novel XD Other people might want to commission me as well!\u003cbr\u003e*Concerning the format: you can also choose the shape of the panels, and how they are placed in the picture while it\u0027s still a WIP.\u003cbr\u003e*How the fees work in this commission type:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Extra characters: You can add up to 4 in the comic, but keep in mind: More characters mean less screentime for each, so you might need more pages.\u003cbr\u003e-NSFW: CURRENTLY not available. Will update the journal when this changes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Extra panels: You can add up 4 more panels before having to buy a new page, so you can increase the length of the page from 8 up to 12 panels =O\u003cbr\u003e-Background: As the background here is constantly changing in each panel, here I charge $5 instead of the usual $3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Icons = $3\u003cbr\u003e*Can feature either the character\u0027s head or their paws.\u003cbr\u003e*It can be flat colored or shaded.\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s all for now! =3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e:Heart: I wuv yu all ! ~\u003c/i\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you can signal boost this journal it would mean alot to me, I hope you guys understand, and thanks in advance uwu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf interested just go ahead and note me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat brought me here ?
