    "summary": "Hello, my name is Robert and I\u0027m an artist. It started with crayons but soon I was moving onto pencils and paints and before too long I had access to cameras and editing facilities. We all know that it\u0027s just a short step from there to creating album covers for industrial bands and abstract videos. I\u0027ve tried to quit but I\u0027ve come to accept that the compulsion is never going away. Please help me with my addiction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI create art (and craft) in a range of styles (it could be said \"disparate\") using a selection of mediums. I mostly address themes of isolation, depression, nature, anxiety, contrast and balance. Sometimes I draw pictures of irritable cartoon animals for light relief. At the moment I am working mostly with photography, montage and digital art but also work with ink, watercolour, video, generative art, electronics, audio, spoken word and whatever else I feel fits. I\u0027m fascinated by and work with texture, geometry, symmetry and minimalism (although not necessarily all at the same time). A lot of my work right now is centered round natural organic forms, mostly photographed in forests and then manipulated and contrasted against geometric shapes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am fascinated by the creative process as much as the outcome and will be sharing and discussing this as much as finished pieces. I will also be experimenting with new mediums and techniques as much as time and resource allows. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAlong with this confusing but tasty creative smorgasbord I also practice more traditional photography (nature mostly) and write blogs about living with anxiety and depression.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhere am I right now?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI am currently trapped by the evil capitalist system (and the desire to eat, wear clothing and live somewhere) in a fairly high stress, time intensive job in a \"creative\u0026#8221; (not very creative) industry. I have been trying to tunnel out under the desk but I\u0027ve only access to a plastic spork and the floor is made of concrete. I find time to work on my own creative projects in between commercial projects and bouts of screaming into the void. I\u0027d quite like to move away from commercial work so as to spend more time on my art and void screaming.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I want?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMore time, less screaming, less being beaten to death by the blunt weapon of indifferent commerce. My goal right now is to slowly and gently peel the crusty barnacle of myself away from the rigid hull of corporate life so that I may swim free in the clear blue sea of creative freedom. I\u0027d like to start making more time for my own creative output by cutting down my work hours. It would be marvelous to give up the day job entirely but a balance between corporate work and art would be pretty peachy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s next?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs I can free up more time as well as making more artwork I will be working on a series of podcasts discussing living with anxiety, increasing my blogging output and working towards some more involved art projects which I just cannot do with the time I have available right now. I will also be looking to collaborate with other artists.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I going to do?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAs well as appealing to you lovely people I will be actively expanding my merchandise ranges, looking for artists to collaborate with and finding whatever creative opportunities I can to help to propel myself in the right direction.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are the risks?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I ever manage to consciously uncouple entirely from the corporate world I may end up drawing happy kittens all day. While I appreciate no-one wants this I feel it\u0027s worth the risk.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo come along, it will be fun (within a certain definition of the word \u0027fun\u0027).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSome links.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eYou can read my existing blog here. \u003ca href=\"http://www.anxioussilence.co.uk/blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.anxioussilence.co.uk/blog/\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have merchandise available at the following lovely outlets:\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSociety6 - \n\u003ca href=\"https://society6.com/anxioussilence\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://society6.com/anxioussilence\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMoreTVicar - \n\u003ca href=\"http://www.moretvicar.com/vendor/anxious-silence\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.moretvicar.com/vendor/anxious-silence\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nEtsy - \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/AnxiousSilence\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.etsy.com/shop/AnxiousSilence\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nYou can see some of my work on:\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFlickr - \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/anxious_silence/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/anxious_silence/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nInstagram - \n\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anxioussilence/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.instagram.com/anxioussilence/\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cblockquote style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\"Dwell as near as possible to the channel in which your life flows.\u0026#8221;\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\n\tHenry David Thoreau\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e"
