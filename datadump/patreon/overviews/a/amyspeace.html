My intention in beginning this was\u00a0\u00a0CONNECTING more regularly with my friends and fans and sharing with you new songs, old songs that I haven\u0027t put on records, blogs, interviews, practically anything that I can find to share that hasn\u0027t seen the light of morning. \u00a0As well, since I\u0027ve begun this page, Jamey and I have started the journey towards having a family (whoo hoo). I\u0027m pregnant, y\u0027all and I\u0027m due on March 21st. \u00a0For the past 15 years, I\u0027ve made my living entirely from being away from home: shows, festivals, teaching, etc. and now that I\u0027m creating a different kind of space in my life for our son, I\u0027m looking towards other means of sharing my work with you that can involve me staying home. \u00a0Not that I won\u0027t tour: I will (despite all the fear about how to do this with baby in tow!). \u00a0But for now, I\u0027m pulling back a bit. \u00a0As well, I\u0027m starting on the next record, which I hope to have for release in late Summer 2018 so I\u0027ve been sharing all the new songs with all of you this year as I write them. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo this has been a Grand Experiment. \u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003ePatreon is not about a single project\u003c/strong\u003e.

To you. And you can pay whatever you feel like paying PER MONTH to read/hear/see all this stuff. You can pay $1 and get everything to see and hear. Or you can pay $100 and actually be able to download it and own it and also get fun things like postcards from me and CD\u0027s I\u0027ll mail you. You can be the Pope of Patronage and pledge $1000 and I\u0027ll call you and you and I can talk shop for an hour, or you can talk to Flo my dog via Skype and maybe help me train her to listen to me and you can come to all my shows for free and be my bestie forever.

I\u0027m currently working on material and ideas for my next album to be recorded late 2017. I\u0027m creatively restless, I write every day, songs and stories and blogs and blog-rambles and I\u0027m endlessly hunting for new ways of describing the familiar interiors and exteriors of our walks together and alone.\u00a0",
