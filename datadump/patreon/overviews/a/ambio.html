    "summary": "Hello and welcome to the American Biography Patreon Page! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmerican Biography is a podcast that seeks to chart the history of the United States by following the course of human events and examining the lives of important and influential - if less often discussed - Americans.\u00a0 In doing so we try to evaluate the whole person;\u00a0their hopes and fears, their flaws and foibles, their brilliance and their boneheadedness, in the hopes of telling the American story through American\u0027s stories.\u00a0 \u003cstrong\u003eBelow please read more about out supporter rewards!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/e/2PACX-1vT98O7-EdF7PV2PAwPl3_T30ONB1Qqal69jM8AqBmQHlb-RNAgxndfNpwBsy9etocK8rdz7x8edsJyi/pub?w=1440\u0026amp;h=1080\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, the way I look at it - If you financially support American Biography you\u2019re a winner in my book but as the old maxim says: to the victors go the spoils.  I don\u2019t want donators or patrons to - for one second - think that I\u2019m going to forget the people who help this podcast keep running.  So I\u2019m please to announce our new supporter rewards program -\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SPOILS SYSTEM\u003c/strong\u003e.  As Podcaster-in-Chief of American Biography I have the ideal means at my disposal by which to thank these supporters and it\u0027s as old as America democracy itself... patronage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have under my power a virtually unlimited number of low to no responsibility, politically insulated, do-nothing jobs that need to be filled in order to ensure the bureaucracy runs smoothly and it\u2019s imperative that these positions are staffed by people who are unquestionably loyal\u2026 er um, I mean, are staffed by meritorious public servants, like yourselves, that I can trust....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo while the spoils system will continue to be updated and improved I can begin to roll out some of the framework now and I\u2019m happy to announce that from here on out those \u003cstrong\u003esupporters who pledge at the $2 per episode level or more on Patreon will not only get access to additional bonus content but will also be in line to get themselves an impressive title along with some cushy government work.  \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow while these jobs come with no salary or discernible benefits, but if say, while I\u2019m not looking, chances arose for you to line your pockets through some influence peddling or just some good old fashion graft, who\u2019s going to be the wiser, if you take my meaning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what jobs are we talking about you may ask?  Well if you\u2019re creative and ambitious enough, you are free to come up with your own snarky, ironic or funny job title or government department to lead and - so long as it fits the bounds of common decency - I\u2019ll appoint you to it!\u00a0 If though you can\u0027t come up with something, don\u0027t worry, I\u2019m happy to find a position for you where your talents will be put to best use.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNeed some inspiration?\u00a0 Well, friend of the show and donor Matt, who\u2019s an avid outdoorsman recently accepted an appointment as the Deputy to the Assistant Director of the Biological Survey Bureau and Fish and Wildlife Coordinator.\u00a0 Through your support of the podcast you too could be kicking back with kickbacks in no time with plum jobs such as the Collector of Customs at the Port of Guernsey, Wyoming or as Postmaster General of Nowhere, Oklahoma. Or perhaps you\u2019d rather bask in the glory of the unalloyed power of being a ranking member of the U.S. Board of Tea Appeals? The sky is the limit!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you\u2019ve been confirmed in your appointment I\u2019ll be happy to announce it in a podcast episode and it will also be emblazoned on the website for all to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for supporting American Biography and remember to the victors go the spoils!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
