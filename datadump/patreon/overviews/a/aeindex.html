    "summary": "Hi there. I\u0027m Scott VanderPloeg and I like comics. And charcuterie, and technology, but we\u0027re here for the comics. In 2010 I started writing about them at Comic Book Daily and continue today, with over 1000 posts and going strong.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround 2013 I realized this new Artist\u0027s Edition (AE) format, printing pages of scanned original comic art at full size, was an exciting way for fans and collectors alike to experience something unique. In 2014 I started a page at Comic Book Daily called\u00a0Artist\u2019s Edition | Gallery Edition | Original Art Archives | Index, listing all AE books in print and everything that was solicited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy collection grew as I committed to reviewing every AE format book as they were published. I realized The Artist\u0027s Edition Index couldn\u0027t be contained and needed its own website, so\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://aeindex.org\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Artist\u0027s Edition Index\u003c/a\u003e was launched in 2017. It\u0027s a one man band, with me doing everything, beholden to no one.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings have been going great, with more and more press and links to my reviews. So why start a Patreon, you may ask? These books are pricey, and I buy them all myself. 2017 saw 19 AE format books published, with a combined cover price of $2495. Yikes! That\u0027s my main expense, along with hosting the site. I have affiliate links on the site, but they don\u0027t generate much income.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScott Dunbier\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/scott.dunbier/posts/10156097252621252\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esays it much better than I do\u003c/a\u003e:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eHey, are you a fan of IDW (or other publishers) Artist\u0027s Edition type books? Then you might want to check this out and become a Patreon backer. This site is a true labor of love, there is no reason for the proprietor to put all this energy, time, and incredible detail into this project except for the pure love of these books. If you can spare a buck or two or 10, this truly is worth it. Updates regularly, all books are reviewed, a terrific podcast... Okay, I\u0027m gushing, but I really appreciate what Scott VanderPloeg does\u2014and if you love AE books, you will too!\u003c/em\u003e"
