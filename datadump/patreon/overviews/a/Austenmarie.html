I live in Los Angeles with my two cats, and \u00a0wonderful roommate- and hey, I like making art. A lot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo much so I started making a webcomic that I\u0027ve been planning to make for about 9 years now all with the help of patreon! I\u0027m also making sketches, proper illustrations, youtube content all on top of the Twitch content! I figured I\u0027d make my Patreon cover ALL THE CREATIVE THINGS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoul On Hold\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.webtoons.com/en/challenge/soul-on-hold/list?title_no=127378\"\u003eSoul On Hold\u003c/a\u003e is a comic based around death, loss, and really- really bad mistakes. BUT THAT BEING SAID, it\u0027s a dark comedy with a lot of cute moments, action, supernatural elements, and romance.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt follows two characters, Ayden and Maggie, both very different sides of the coin personality-wise, as they try and figure out what in the hell is happening to them- and the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/Ad8Zin8.jpg\" style=\"width: 495px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s been a brain baby of mine for about nine years now and I\u0027m finally ready to jump into it. Since this is my first comic project solo, I am absolutely terrified and excited at the same time.\u003cbr\u003eThis format is all new for me, and I\u0027ll be working on it in a process. I\u0027m so excited for you all to join me in this! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYOUTUBE + TWITCH\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY YOUTUBE CONTENT! Getting back on the grind with art videos, Vlogs, Q+A\u0027s and even some secret things that will be showing up *hopefully* soon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIdeally would love to do more tutorials and work on speedpaints that go into traditional mediums as well!\u003cbr\u003eYoutube is all a work in progress, and will change as I figure out my steps there! Also Twitch is still going Monday-Friday at 10AM PST, and will continue to be artwork and variety. If you want to support my twitch here, please feel free to as I get far more of a cut than I would on Twitch!

I would like to branch out into more how-tos and share processes plus high res images.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNSFW? Yes! I want to dabble in drawing erotica, nothing crazy explicit, but cute sexy fun stuff- so keep an eye out! I\u0027ll be making a separate pledge section once I gather the MATERIALS. (I.e. draw fun things)\u003cbr\u003eI would also love Patrons to be able to vote on WIP pieces to be finished, either on stream or privately and recorded.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings will be added as this goes on and evolves, but this is now a catch all for all things creative!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU ALL SO MUCH!\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
