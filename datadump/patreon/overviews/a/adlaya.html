    "summary": "Hello, world of Patreon! Thanks for coming to visit my page, I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re here! I\u2019m a little unsure of what exactly to put here, so I\u2019ll start off by answering a few questions: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho are you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m a self-taught artist that loves to sketch, paint, and draw lots of fun things. I have a pet portrait business, where I create commissioned portraits of animals (and sometimes other things) in ink, watercolour, and pencil. You can visit my website here: \u003ca href=\"https://adlayasart.wordpress.com/\"\u003ehttps://adlayasart.wordpress.com/\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut\u2026 you already charge for commissions. Why do you need patrons? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nGood question! Although I do charge for my animal commissions, there\u2019s a lot of other art that I love to do. But earning a living comes first, so often that kind of thing gets pushed aside in favour of a commission. I love the work I do, and drawing people\u2019s pets is very rewarding, but my goal is to grow as an artist and explore different styles, mediums, and genres. Your donation will help fund my artistic experiments! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay, that makes sense! So what else do work on? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u2019m a big fan of anime and manga, so I will often draw characters from my favourite series. Video games are another source of inspiration for me; two of my favourites are Pokemon and The World Ends With You. Subject matter isn\u2019t the only thing I experiment with \u2014 I love trying out new styles. In the past few months, I\u2019ve started working with charcoal, pastels, and watercolour pencils, all things I haven\u2019t tried since I was a kid. Another big, scary genre for me is digital art. I bought a very old used Wacom tablet this year, and have been practicing with it as much as time allows. I love the look of digital art, and would absolutely love to get better at it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo you do anything besides art?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes! I also have an animal blog, where I talk about different species of animal each week, and what makes them amazing. I\u0027ve written over 400 posts, and have recently started drawing each animal I write about. This has been a labour of love for me for the past four years, and I don\u0027t plan on stopping anytime soon. That being said, if you would like to support my blog, any and all patronage helps! You can check out my blog here:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://adlayasanimals.wordpress.com/\"\u003ehttps://adlayasanimals.wordpress.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
