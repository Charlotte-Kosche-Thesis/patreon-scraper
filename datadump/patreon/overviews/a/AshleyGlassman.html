    "summary": "Hi Friends! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have suggested I start a Patreon account for my YouTube channel over the last year, and I\u2019ve been STAUNCHLY opposed. \u00a0(Yes, I\u2019m stubborn. \ud83d\ude09) \u00a0I created my plant channel to share my love and knowledge of plants, and sharing enriches my life so very much! \u00a0I am truly passionate about plants and all things horticulturally related, and sharing my knowledge with others is just a natural extension of that. \u00a0I didn\u2019t think when I started the channel anyone would find it, because I never shared links or even told my closest friends and family about it! \u00a0I was just doing videos to practice talking to the camera, in case SOMEDAY I decided to do an actual plant channel. \u00a0But somehow people found me none the less, and what was meant to be practice turned into the actual project! \u00a0And I\u2019m SO incredibly blessed that it did, because it\u2019s been a blast! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year I am doing so many things differently in my life, and one of those is letting myself receive love from others. \u00a0I enjoy giving, but receiving has always made me VERY uncomfortable. \u00a0It has felt wrong somehow... \u00a0like I\u2019m taking something from others without properly earning it. \u00a0So for 2018 my goal is to be open to giving AND receiving. \u00a0And to rest in the knowledge that just as it brings me joy to give, it also brings others that same joy to give to me. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo when I again stated getting suggestions in the beginning of Jan to start a Patreon account so people could contribute to my plant videos etc, if desired; as much as I reacted internally with \u201cHECK NO! \u00a0I\u2019m not doing this to make money I\u2019m doing this because I love it! \u00a0And if people see a Patreon link they will think I\u2019m just trying to start a business, not that this is truly my love and I WANT to share freely!\u201d \u00a0After the initial reaction died down, my internal voice of guidance said quietly \u201cBut what if they WANT to share with you and help you? \u00a0Is what you want (not to be viewed as trying to get money) so much more important than what other people want? \u00a0And if they want to share isn\u2019t that beautiful? \u00a0Why would you want to stop that?\u201d\u003cbr\u003eSo even though it scares me, and I never want anyone to feel obligated, I am choosing to believe that only those who really want to share will, and that through their sharing something beautiful will happen! \u00a0I will use any funds to enrich my video content. \u00a0Either by purchasing books to review etc., products to review, plants to discuss, etc. \u00a0And am entirely open to ideas on how to use any funds donated here, and am incredibly humbled that people even asked if they could help in some way! \u00a0This journey is taking me in directions I never expected, but it\u2019s beautiful and exciting! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI hope soon to have some special content for donators, which may take a little time. \u00a0But in the meantime I will continue to put out content on YouTube for everyone as I am able!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for visiting this page, and being a viewer on YouTube! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBlessed by love,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAshley\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. For those of you like me, who are not familiar with Patreon; \u00a0you do NOT have to make a monthly contribution you can make a one time contribution if you would like to! \u00a0I\u2019m not into monthly stuff myself, I just like to donate what I feel like right then. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThey have this set up a little confusing. \u00a0When you go to donate it will say you are committing to donate $1.00 every month. After you click \u201cok\u201d or \u201cdonate\u201d you will be taken to a page where you can adjust the amount. \u00a0But it will still say you are committing monthly.\u003cbr\u003eIn order to donate only once, you just need to put in the amount you wish to donate, and then proceed with the transaction as if you were committing to that much every month. \u00a0After you complete the process, you just have to wait till your first \u201cmonths\u201d donation is processed (and you will get an email telling you that has happened) at which point you just cancel your \u201csubscription\u201d or commitment, at which point no other charges in future months will take place. \u00a0I understand Patreon is trying to get people to commit to ongoing support for artists and creators, but I really think a one time option would be helpful. \u00a0But for now, this works well, and a lot of people only do one time contributions, not monthly. \u00a0I personally have supported others on Patreon even though I never used it for myself, and it worked quite well just doing a one time payment and then canceling. \u00a0But since I don\u2019t doing like ongoing monthly donations, I thought I would mention this. \ud83d\ude09"
