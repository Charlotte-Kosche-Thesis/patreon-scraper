My alternate\nhistory work most often focuses on steampunk, but I am also drawn to the early\n20th century and the future (by which I mean space, and probably more robots).\nYou can find out more about my published work on \u003ca href=\"http://www.allimartin.com/home/books/\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAside from authoring my own works, I am passionate about\nhelping other authors bring out the full potential in their writing. I have an\nMFA in Fiction from the University of Central Florida and have developed an eye\nnot only for identifying the strengths and weaknesses of in-progress work, but\nfor helping authors develop their vision. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.allimartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Patreon_WhyPatreon.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a career in educational publishing spanning eleven\nyears, I decided to cut ties with traditional employment and pursue a new\ncareer in which I could be in charge of my creative hours and output. As I\npursue traditional publishing, I am making ends meet through a collection of\npursuits including freelance editing, teaching writing workshops, and Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI can schedule writing workshops in advance, but editing jobs\ncome as they\u0027re available, which means Patreon will provide a steady source of\nincome throughout the year. Revenue will go toward everything from keeping my\nwebsite running to allowing me to travel to writing group, workshops, and\nconferences to paying for hardware and software. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhether you want to get access to my creative work or are a\nwriter interested in the writing resources I have to offer, I hope you\u0027ll enjoy\nwhat I share here and find something you can carry with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.allimartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Patreon_Writer-Resources.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting communities and support are important to me. In\naddition to being a freelance editor, I am a Municipal Liaison for the NaNoWriMo Orlando Region and run\nthe writing group Central Florida Inklings.\nI am active in other Orlando\nwriting communities, including the MFA\nprogram at UCF, Writer\u0027s\nAtelier, and the Orlando\nPublic Library. I love talking to writers about writing and helping writers\ndevelop.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSome of my Patreon rewards are geared specifically toward supporting\nwriters. These tiers include editorial consultations, supplemental writing\nresources, and opportunities for you to ask questions. Not sure how to\npunctuate a sentence you\u0027ve written? Never got the hang of semi-colons? I\u0027ve\ngot you covered. There are also tiers where you\u0027ll have access to recorded workshops\nand presentations. (For questions about editorial consultations, please see the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/18556783\"\u003eFAQ\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u0027re here more as a writer than as a reader, don\u0027t be\nshy. I\u0027m as eager to help you with your writing as I am to find readers of my\nown.\u003cbr\u003e"
