So I am trying to save to buy video equipment for the same.\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me you\u0027ll get insights into my creative process, my artworks, among other things. I do hope that my works bring joy to people and supporting me means that I am able to spend more time making art!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch4\u003eMy Dream\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003eIts my dream to explore visual beauty through art, to go into a state of a deep sense of abandon, inspiration and awe through colors, light and shadows and forms. In a way, imitating the creator in my own tiny, silly way. And in making that happen, your small support could make a lot of difference.\u003c/h4\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003cem\u003eBy supporting me you are helping me open doors and explore possibilities where there were none before! I don\u0027t want to hold back, you could release the artist in me.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIf you love what I do - and you\u0027d like to see more of it, consider becoming my patron. Every tiny bit helps keep me pushing, painting, creating and lightening up the world around me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI don\u0027t hold myself to any standards or compare to other artists - I want you to fund me because \u003cem\u003eyou want to fund me. \u003c/em\u003eI do not want to gate off my work, hold it to ransom, or otherwise batter you into opening a wallet. While I will obviously need to raise awareness of this Patreon, I will not litter my posts, videos and social media with constant calls for funding. I\u0027ll do \u003cem\u003esome \u003c/em\u003epromotion, because that makes sense, but I\u0027ll work hard so that it isn\u0027t obnoxious. You wanna watch and enjoy my art, not be advertised to!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo access my content, you need only access it. Pay as much or as little as you want. Pay nothing if you don\u0027t believe you should. I have one milestone goal which would cover production costs as well as support for my family. Anything above that would be incredible, and allow me even more freedom to do stuff. I want to keep this simple though. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eClearly, I\u0027ll need to be able to make a living off this in order to keep doing it, but it\u0027s your decision as to whether or not I do. I\u0027ve gone back and forth on the idea of crowdfunding. I\u0027ve been scared to do it, sometimes critical of it, and I\u0027ve always wanted to make stuff first and get paid later. But this is a chance to strike for true independence and artistic freedom, and after much soul-searching, I think this could actually work. I sincerely, truly hope it works. I want to be able to make more and more art, videos and also tutorials in future on my own terms now, and to directly serve you, my fans. And I don\u0027t want to do it while hawking some bloody corn snack products. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem style=\"background-color: initial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;\"\u003eJoin me in this.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0Share just a little bit of love and see how it grows.
