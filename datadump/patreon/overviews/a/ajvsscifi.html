    "summary": "Jeremy and Alan are both educators and Science Fiction fans.\nWe both felt that interest literature and reading were not emphasized enough in\nour culture. We also realized that there were a lot of great short Science\nFiction stories out there not getting the attention they deserved. So, to try\nemphasize the importance of literature in our culture and short fiction in SF,\nwe decided to invite guests from different walks of life to come and discuss science\nfiction and how it reflects on their careers and life experiences.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe result is freewheeling conversations that allow the listeners to feel like\nthey\u2019re eavesdropping on lively conversations among friends. We want to learn\nabout our guests, our world, and literature in that way. We\u2019re finding that\neveryone we talk to has something genuinely interesting and insightful to\ncontribute to the conversation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEssentially split into two segments \u2013 a discussion of a sci-fi short story and\nan exploration of a related idea or theme \u2013 our podcast covers classic stories\nby well-known science fiction authors like Ray Bradbury and William Gibson to\ncomparably newer voices like Zhang Ran and Mary Robinette Kowal. Our guests\ninclude musicians, scientists, entrepreneurs, authors, editors, artists, and\nlovers of genre fiction. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the end, we are most interested in having provocative\ndiscussions about our favorite genre with interesting people. We\u2019re a\ncouple of unapologetic sci-fi geeks who know a thing or two about literary\nstudies.\u003cbr\u003e"
