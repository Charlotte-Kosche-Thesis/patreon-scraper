    "summary": "Hey page viewer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Acheroth, and I\u0027m a professional animator in the games industry. In my spare time I Like to make furry animations, typically (but not exclusively) macro or growth related. It takes a long arsed time to make even a short animation; and when I work full time (and sometimes crunch hours) in my day job, its not always easy to justify the amount of time I invest in such projects. This is hopefully where you can come in ^^.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what I do, and are willing and able, then feel free to help support me as I create free content for like minded peeps. My longer term dream is to be able to produce such content on a part time or even full time basis, hand hopefully this patreon account can help me on that path :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo start of with, I am aiming to have one animation released every four to six months.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn terms of rewards, I have offered various nik nax which you might find appealing. And I\u0027m always open to feedback and suggestions, so please send me your ideas as I build this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe big rewards I am offering, however, will be voting privileges and nomination rights.\u003cbr\u003eI will always be running at least one animation project. When I have finished an animation, I will open up a vote as for my next animation. I will list four or five potential projects, with an explanation of each. Contributors will be able to commit their votes to their preferred project, and which ever has the most amount of votes, will be the project I work on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSometimes there will be additional votes, such as a vote on what species or sex a character will be in the chosen animation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNomination rights are granted to significant and long term contributors. When a contributor has amassed 6 nomination rights, they may spend these rights on opting to have their own concept put up for animation in the next vote. HOWEVER; I reserve the right to reject the chosen nomination. There are certain animation concepts I do not want to touch, and some concepts may be too big for me to develop and animate for, so please check with me if your concept is acceptable before committing to such levels of contribution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for considering supporting me! Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions!\u003cbr\u003e"
