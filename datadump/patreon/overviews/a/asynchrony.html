    "summary": "Well hi there. Suppose you want to know a little bit about us. Well, to get started, you should probably know what we think about the state of the narrative craft in today\u0027s contemporary culture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s lame as fuck, basically. Mostly just a bunch of watered down, accessible, feel-good, designed by committee, IP, content, DLC, we\u0027ll-patch-it-later, this-didn\u0027t-test-well, fucking garbage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe here at Asynchrony, are not into that. We believe in telling great stories. With copious use of the word fuck and more adult oriented themes than you can shake a dildo-armed robot at. Our personal perspective, is that commerce has taken to much control of narrative. Stories are built in vacuums, crafted by stakeholders and fearful market watchdogs, and alternatives aren\u0027t provided for fear of dissenting opinion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe tried to collaborate with filmmakers in the real world, but in general, they were mostly dicks too. Always looking for a payout instead of focusing on what we could make together. So we turned to the jolly-ol internet. Where we can make whatever the fuck we want and maybe find some kindred spirits. We hope you are one of those kindred spirits, and that you take hold of our shaky, somewhat clammy hand, and march into the dark forest of creativity with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you do decide to fork over cash it will be used to help develop the show. There is a solid line item for hookers and cocaine, and that\u0027s not up for debate, but most of it will go into labor, equipment, and R\u0026amp;D. Just wait till you see motion-capture combined with dildo physics. It\u0027s glorious.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt will tickle you. Tickled us, that\u0027s for sure, but that may have been all the exploding pillows. Pillow fights never end the way the movies seem to imply. Ours had a lot more gunfire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo. Give us cash. We won\u0027t spend ALL of it on vices, and all the great collaborators you\u0027ve come to know and love will finally make some fucking skrill. With the extra skrill, we will now be able to afford really excellent talent, as we no longer have to start off every e-mail with \"We have no money, and we say fuck a lot, also our premise is mostly about sexual innuendo, drug use, and violence. How\u0027s about it?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe love characters, we love stories, we want to tell ones that matter, that make people laugh, that challenge your assumptions. We want to take you out of your life and plunge you back into feeling like a fucking boss. Help us make that dream happen... or Benny will rip your fucking arms off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u0026lt;3\u00a0"
