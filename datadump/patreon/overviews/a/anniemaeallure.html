Thank you for visiting my Patreon page!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a model, performance artist, and producer based in Kansas City, specializing in burlesque and vaudeville style performances.  I\u0027ve been fortunate enough to not only perform internationally, but to bring other internationally known performers to Kansas City\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope that you will consider becoming a patron. Your contributions would allow me to create new solo acts, produce higher quality shows with new headliners, provide classes and workshops to those wishing to learn, and advertise to bring new audience members to the world of burlesque. Most importantly, your contributions will allow me to pay the amazingly talented performers a fair rate to be in my productions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I plan on producing one show a month. Odd months will bring you the Rude Revue and Burly Q, giving local talent a place to showcase their abilities and you the chance to have an entertaining evening out at an affordable cost. If I can gain enough patrons, I hope to also produce a themed show in every even month of the year that will feature local and INTERNATIONAL acts, performing routines you won\u0027t be able to see anywhere else.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t afford to pledge right now? You can still help out by attending my productions and sharing the events with your friends. No matter how you help, know that you are appreciated. My fans are my friends and I am so blessed to have you!"
