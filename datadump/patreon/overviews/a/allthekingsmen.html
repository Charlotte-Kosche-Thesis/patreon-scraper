We appreciate any support you are willing to give. Rook and I have long done commissions and artwork within the furry fandom. We\u0027ve been around the block for almost a decade. Though we enjoy working with others and doing artwork for our fans, our true passion is comics and story telling. Years ago a comic auction lead to the creation of \u0027All the King\u0027s Men\u0027, a cosplay role-playing comic which was released some time ago. We ended up loving the concept and after some brainstorming we came up with a story and world with a lot of rich lore and interesting characters. We also decided we wanted to keep the project community oriented, so fans and commissioners can participate and even star in stories we write as the comic expands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find more of our work here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/lavenderpandy/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/lavenderpandy/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.furaffinity.net/user/theblackrook\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.furaffinity.net/user/theblackrook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eWhat is All the King\u2019s Men?_____________\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eATKM is a community driven comic project set in the fictional world of Elcrest. The story revolves around the many adventures of the titular King\u2019s men, and of course women, the fabled \u0027Raven Knights\u0027. These erotic fantasy stories range from humorous to thought provoking all while maintaining a central narrative that ties into the main plot.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eThe Plot\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e_____________\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIt is the year 255 AC (After Cataclysm) on the planet of Elcrest, a world inhabited by anthropomorphic creatures known as kinlings. The continent of Theria is thought to be the only one in the entire world to have survived an extinction level event called the Baptism of Fire. The Baptism was a great war that began when four celestial dragons descended upon the world in order to punish the hubris and audacity of the godlike beings known as \u0027Eternians\u0027 and the furkins they showed favor to. The Dragon\u0027s of the Four Corners, great beast born of a mighty eidolon named Salamus, uplifted and empowered the lizardkin of Elcrest. With the lizardkin in their thrall, they waged a bloody campaign to cleanse the world in dragon fire. They very nearly succeeded if not for the bravery and sacrifices of brave heroes of the furkin races. Though time has passed and Theria is recovering, there are scars left behind by the great inferno in the lands and it\u2019s various peoples. These scars are deep and drive a wedge between the all the kinlings of Elcrest. Now, a dark intent shadows the land and the anxieties, fears and animosities of its various races are rising. The children of the Age of Fire stand at the dawn of a new peril, unaware and unprepared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the center of this growing conflict is Lioncourt Kingdom. The legacy of the legendary, \u0027Queen of Hearts\u0027, Alanzia de Lioncourt who united the furkin races in order to end the madness that was the baptism. Lioncourt stands as one of the Kingdoms still whole after the cataclysm. There, among it\u2019s Knighthood are a special group of men and women known as the Order of Raven Knights. Entrusted with the \u0027Eldeidan\u0027, magical weapons of tremendous power, they are tasked with the defense of the realm and protection of the lands of Theria from all things extraordinary and supernatural. To stand against creatures like the \u0027Dragons of the Four Corners\u0027, elderians, beasts of mana and mages made with power. They are sworn to protect against the corruption and blight these forces can cause. Their\u0027s is a history that is respected across the lands of Theria. All the King\u2019s Men refers specifically to them, King Eriol\u2019s Raven Knights. We follow their various adventures as their lives and duties place them square in the middle of the rising danger that is threatening the lands."
