Their human potential.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a space for all who feel and intense aversion to \u2018normal\u2019 life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a space for those who have spent their entire lives - or a good chunk of their lives - feeling completely incapable of being or doing what was expected. For those who have tried with all their might to live as family, friends and society have dictated - always winding up getting burnt out, broken, depressed, lost having to regroup and restart over and over again.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a space for those who know there\u2019s more. More to life. More to themselves. More to the experience we are capable of having here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a space for all who have felt the call to something deeper - who have been pulled into dark emotional turmoil, who have faced the fear of knowing they couldn\u2019t live how everyone else was living, but who had no idea how to live any other way. This is a space for those who are DONE with the limits of society, and are ready to take full responsibility for their lives and the outcomes of their lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is for those who\u2019s bodies and minds won\u2019t cooperate with normal life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is for those who have seen and touched God, and want to know how to make this a way of LIFE - not a come and go experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a space for the mystics. The empaths. The awakening ones who are feeling uninspired and unsupported by traditional spiritual paths/the new age religion.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nThis is for all the awakening souls who are looking for a home.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat you will find here is knowledge and information. This wisdom is both old and new, all pulled from reality itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is spirituality in the 21st century. This is not fancy theory that has no application. This is not rainbows and unicorns and fairy tarot cards. This is not endless hours of meditation or spiritual sessions that leave you feeling and living how you have always felt and lived. This is not outdated teachings that have no application to the modern world.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is about breaking through.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is about integrating conditioning, learning about the true self, learning about the true laws of the reality and learning how these factors all combine to create the singularity that is YOU. This is about self realization, that leads to the capacity to create LIFE. True life. Real life. Awake life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn the Aliyah Mystery School you will have access to 8 exclusive videos per month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThese videos will serves as your ever evolving course curriculum. They will be your jumping off point, your inspiration point, your place to explore the ideas and concepts that are so key and vital to this awakening journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn these videos I will explore with you:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eDeep tissue cleansing.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTrue shadow work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePractical integration tools.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMATURING the traumatized inner child.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to learn.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to integrate so you can transcend.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to access your fullest potential.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to move from victim to empowered co-creator.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMystical traditions.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to create a life evolved from your conditioning.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou will also have access to a private Facebook group where you can connect and share with the other initiates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat you \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ewill not find\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e here is hand holding, individualized coaching or babysitting. This work is to be taken on from a fully adult perspective. You are here because you want to become your truest and highest self, and you are aware that you and only you can make that happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI cannot give you the answers to how this material applies to you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI cannot tell you what you should or should not implement at this time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI cannot tell you what you should be getting from this information.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI cannot tell you what the universal means for your relative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\nBut YOU CAN.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a place for you to learn how to do this for yourself. How to take in information that is confusing or over your head right now, and how to sit with it. How to process it. How to take the universal principals and apply them to your relative life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is a MASSIVE and important key.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou will be given the space here to figure this stuff out for YOURSELF. There will be plenty of times you feel scared, overwhelmed, detached from the information or like you are lost or highly triggered. There will be times when all you want is for someone to give you the answer you are looking for. For someone to explain the concepts for you in a way that is relative to you and your life. This is good. This is key. Learning to face these situations and go WITHIN rather than looking for the answer WITHOUT is an essential principal in the waking up journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis space will provide this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou will have your community and your teacher, but you will be the one who is solely responsible for yourself, what comes up for you and for finding the answers you seek.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will give you the universal. YOU will be responsible for piecing together the relative.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is for the serious aspirants who want to face their own darkness, the mysteries of this world and who are ready to face these things head on knowing the only way to truth is through embracing all things. Who are not afraid to discover the truth - and who are willing to live within the bounds of truth even if that means living a totally different life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is for those who are ready to take FULL responsibility for their own lives. Their bodies. Their minds. Their souls.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nNo guru followers. Only masters awakening.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you sign up to this school, you are waiving all rights to project onto anyone in the group. You are fully owning that this is YOUR life, and your responsibility. You are aware that you will be exposed to very powerful information, and you are claiming that you and only you have the power and authority to decide what you do with it. You are stepping out of the role of student, out of the role of child, out of the role of follower and into the role of Master. By signing up for this group, you are claiming that you are the master of your own ship, that you will take what serves you, that you will leave what doesn\u0027t. That you will try what calls to you, and that you will abandon what does not work for you. You are fully owning your journey now. You are ready to stop looking outside for the answers and for anyone to blame, and to own that you have the keys within yourself - you just need a little reminder.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are ready to own your journey.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf this sounds like music to your soul, I am so happy to have you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLet\u2019s awaken together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is a self led curriculum, and you can join at any time. Feel free to go through the materials at your own pace.\u003cbr\u003e"
