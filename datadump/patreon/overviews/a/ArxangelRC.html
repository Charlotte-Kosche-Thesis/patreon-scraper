FPV is definitely what kept my interest in this hobby, and when you couple that with long range planes... things start to get VERY interesting and it is a thrill! I do reviews of planes, copters and gear related to them, and A LOT of tests of said gear so I can push it to its limits and let you guys know what to expect! Thing is, as I start devoting more and more time to this, I will need your support to move forward and to keep doing what I am doing, as it is slowly becoming a job, in addition to a great hobby, but with the added bonus of never being boring! I want to thank all of you who decide to support me here, or in any other way you find fit. I really appreciate it guys, you are what is allowing me to do this, and I LOVE doing it!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHave a nice day, and I will see you in the skies!"

You will also gain access to posts that are published only on this platform for my Patreon supporters, as well as early access to some of my videos, a few days before they go public. Since I do my best to reply to every comment here, under my videos, on my blog, on Facebook, etc., you have lots of ways to contact me for help or information, and I really do hope that you would consider my efforts and time worth the $2 this tier is asking of you. In addition, using any of my links in the blog and under the videos to buy anything from the linked sites would be much appreciated, as it also helps support the work I do, and my family!\u00a0",
