My name is Ben Sime, and this is Arcane Reservoir a Malifaux focused podcast. I\u0027ve been a voice of many Malifaux podcasts for roughly five years (maybe longer, please don\u2019t make me count), and I\u0027ve been hosting this particular show for about a year and a half. Until AR, as the kids like to call it, I was only ever a voice on the show, a co-host at best, over the years people decided to give up on or stop podcasting (be it permanent or a long period of time) and I had to hop from show to show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I created my own show: Arcane Reservoir. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eSo What Is That?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAfter doing so many shows I (mostly) knew exactly what I wanted from the podcast.\u003cbr\u003eI wanted it to sound good.\u003cbr\u003eI wanted the Malifaux scene, especially the UK tournaments and new TOs to get the coverage they deserve.\u003cbr\u003eI wanted the show to be a voice for those that I would want to hear from and that others may not get to, a place to be a voice for some who have a silent presence in this ever-growing scene.\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to keep to a schedule.\u003cbr\u003eAlso I wanted to do a show that I know that I would listen to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTaking on hosting, editing, publishing and everything else became equally more work as it was more rewarding. There is a sense of achievement when hitting publish every fortnight and the best feeling when someone tells me either online or at an event that they enjoyed the show.\u003cbr\u003eHowever, when the mics go off my work is no longer over. Priding myself on having the show be as listenable as I can make it takes time and effort. Editing the show takes two to three times as long as recording minimum, previously longer as all the editing I do is self taught or done via the power of Googling.\u003cbr\u003eThis in itself has been a learning experience but spending an evening editing a podcast about a game rather than going out to actually play it can be an issue.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow even with all these extra responsibilities and costs (such as hosting) I have taken on without your funding I would still try and keep the show going but it has come to a point where I need to look forwards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lM5ukzMITkQ/WDb2Aha1yzI/AAAAAAAACzs/4LNhLGLf7WMxt_mUsUaLV7jFxKUXJmoggCLcB/s1600/tees.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003eTHE 2018 UPDATE\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne Year In\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to the support of Patrons past and present Arcane Reservoir has been able to do many cool things.\u003cbr\u003eSweet merchandise, bar one week off there\u0027s been a new show every two weeks, quality of sound has improved, there\u0027s a website (more on that later) and there had even been lots of prizes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver this year I\u0027ve learnt a lot of things that work and don\u0027t for the Patreon and I\u0027d like to not just do more of the same, I\u0027d like to do more \u003cstrong\u003eand\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0the same.\u003cbr\u003eBy that I mean, still a show every two weeks but hey, why not weekly if there is demand.\u003cbr\u003eMerchandise is cool, let\u0027s make a little more and make it a little more easily available.\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s continue having raffles but let\u0027s have better prizes.\u003cbr\u003eTwitter, Facebook, they\u0027re both nice but let\u0027s open up somewhere else (more private) to chat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFunding?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003eWhen I set up the Patreon I explained that I didn\u0027t want to have sponsorship, in fact maybe to my own determent I also barely plug even the Patreon itself on the podcast itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI still stand by the fact that I don\u0027t want full on ad-breaks and I don\u0027t want 10 minutes of spiel at the beginning of the show unless it\u0027s to promote events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne mild change is that I do have an affiliate link with Leodis Games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fleodisgames.com%2Fref%2F6%2F\u0026amp;h=ATOKBPY8EG9JDqYUGCPrJoO4zxGcnJsRCePeD1PLYBz-Ih_LZcPcW0DUUaY-rco-ac6IEunPCErCS811jaWAPY5_PDGIIMS5jjafitjPmXjs3aPKF72NVNzRNrRFvrIT8fa5clpdYZtzNHga94YYgLHxalyVfL7_PkptGy_IdCXLrfgO8aR_dPFEM5gtHbyZo_irJiUDr1YSFKEu8v2TRC843cpA-Rl0n91nAjn8L0gahrPwLw7iR2gSPJk1J0I4QMr79QMgER7zd30ay8zqGZbLuoiwRqtdz9307p9J9DW8jPDulPSELmtRfMmo7kDuWm0OdhUm7DHBanon9BiU\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fleodisgames.com%2Fref%2F6%2F\u0026amp;h=ATOKBPY8EG9JDqYUGCPrJoO4zxGcnJsRCePeD1PLYBz-Ih_LZcPcW0DUUaY-rco-ac6IEunPCErCS811jaWAPY5_PDGIIMS5jjafitjPmXjs3aPKF72NVNzRNrRFvrIT8fa5clpdYZtzNHga94YYgLHxalyVfL7_PkptGy_IdCXLrfgO8aR_dPFEM5gtHbyZo_irJiUDr1YSFKEu8v2TRC843cpA-Rl0n91nAjn8L0gahrPwLw7iR2gSPJk1J0I4QMr79QMgER7zd30ay8zqGZbLuoiwRqtdz9307p9J9DW8jPDulPSELmtRfMmo7kDuWm0OdhUm7DHBanon9BiU\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-lht6-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2147-6/c22.0.306.306/p306x306/20274051_1855204048141414_7023378956212502528_n.jpg?oh=1b731d84722513d569a1ec193197e1ab\u0026amp;oe=5AA01160\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThey\u0027ve been very good to me as a customer and with permission from the Patrons (at the time) I sorted this out.\u003cbr\u003eSimply use\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://leodisgames.com/ref/6/\"\u003ehttp://leodisgames.com/ref/6/\u003c/a\u003e when shopping for toys.
