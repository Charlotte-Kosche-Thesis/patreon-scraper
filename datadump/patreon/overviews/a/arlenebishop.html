Not just \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e band: a grand dame of a band that sits and stands, struts and glams. So here\u0027s the plan: this kick-ass band will include a big ensemble of singers. Not just back-up singers or a choir but a veritable orchestra of voices. Let\u0027s call it a \u2013\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eVORCHESTRA\u003c/strong\u003e: a sweet word of magical origin describing a\n star-studded ensemble of amazing singers working together to blow the roof off a\n live* album concert recording.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Yeah, that\u0027s right. For a \u003cem\u003elive album concert recording\u003c/em\u003e. After four studio-albums I\u0027m \nfinally making a live album. And, of course, that means a live show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eSo, let\u0027s recap: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eArlene Bishop is beginning rehearsals for a live show\u003cbr\u003eand she wants to include a lot of beloved singers\u003cbr\u003eand the show will be recorded as her next album\u003cbr\u003eand she\u0027s talking about herself in the third person because she means business.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA concert recording demands dedicated rehearsals from committed artists and there\u0027s the catch \u003cem\u003e\u2013 musicians are \u003cem\u003ealways\u003c/em\u003e being asked to work for free and I won\u0027t do that. \u003c/em\u003eI want to offer a modest honorarium for each rehearsal... at least enough to cover bus fare, coffee, non-dairy snacks and a little pocket money. Did I mention I\u0027m an indie artist? That means I\u0027m self-funded so I\u0027ll only bring in as many singers as I can afford, and, well, er, that\u0027s more like a trio than a vorchestra :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor whatever your pledge per video, you can help me bring in singers and roll out my biggest project.\u00a0 You\u0027ll get first access to videos of the rehearsals, hear the music, see interviews with the new vocalists I meet, watch the Vorchestra grow and see the project progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to see who I meet both here in Patreon and there in muso world. Let\u0027s see where this goes as I do what I need to get closer to my live album. Thank you! Peace.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
