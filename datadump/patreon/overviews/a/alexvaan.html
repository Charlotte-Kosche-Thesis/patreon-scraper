But I also create content for YouTube, whether its Bitwig Tutorials, Music Videos, or Vlogging.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI also host a Podcast called \u0027The A Side Podcast.\u0027 At the time of writing this, we have not released any episodes yet because we are banking episodes for a bigger launch.\u003cbr\u003eI am also working on a Travel Vlog with my Girlfriend Erin that will come out soon as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for supporting me!!! I\u0027m sure you know as well as I do that creating is more about doing something you love, than it is about paying any bills. But the unfortunate fact is that it actually costs so much money to create, whether its equipment, or internet, or software etc.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI can\u0027t tell you how great it makes me feel that there are people like you willing to support my journey and help me out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s really just amazing.\u003cbr\u003eThank You!!!!\u003cbr\u003e"
