My first memories include being surrounded and immersed with nerd culture through 90\u0027s manga books and anime, Warhammer 40K, Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, vintage game systems, World of Warcraft, online MMORPG\u0027s and any superhero, fantasy, or Sci-Fi VHS I could get my grubby little hands on. \u00a0I gobbled down microwave Ramen bowls by the carton full, and happily cried myself to sleep many a nights reading my hand-me-down Elfquest comic books and immersing myself in countless wonderful fantasy worlds which allowed me to slay dragons, save the world, and soar to infinity and beyond even at 7 years old.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFrom the very start, it\u0027s been my goal to\u00a0do everything I can to make beautiful things, help make the world more colorful, loud, vibrant, and filled with fun! I am a people pleaser, and love to bring excitement and squeals to others even more than myself! \u00a0I genuinely don\u0027t know when I am the happiest, sitting in my studio with messy hair and covered in glue, glitter, and paint-- or completely dolled up in an elaborate costume and fantasy makeup, making magic with a talented photographer. Since I was tiny in that gaming shop, I\u0027ve LIVE to craft or create something every single day... Be it a tangible trinket, a costume piece, a necklace to gift to someone, a mini painting, a quick sketch or artsy photograph-- it\u0027s how I\u0027ve been expressing myself and functioning for forever now!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/hlSzCpL.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(95, 73, 122);\"\u003eprofessional\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e cosplay journey began about 5 years ago when I fell head over heels in love costuming by creating my first armor build as an elaborate Halloween costume. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(84, 141, 212);\"\u003eSergeant Calhoun from Wreck it Ralph\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e came to life, and fast forwarding to now, I am a self proclaimed detail freak!

I threw my heart and soul into creating only my very best since day once, growing with each new experience, deadline, and material-- and now, I\u0027m hooked beyond compare. Now that the gaming store I grew up in is no longer in operation, my father lovingly referred to as \"DadSkies Cosplay\" (who has been a professional artist his entire life as well) joins me in the crafting magic and I learn even more through his advice and teachings. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt this point in time, I\u0027ve got about\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u00a050 handmade cosplays and \u0027from-scratch\u0027 props \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eunder my belt, which were created for both myself and others through commission work and can\u0027t wait to see where else we fly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/1bnHKFT.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition, to cosplay I\u0027m also an avid all around artist-- specifically a painter of acrylic on canvas works!

I want an intimate community where I can share every step of my progress with you.

They deserve to be paid what they are worth-- and with being a teacher, money is already tight with no extra funds to hire these talented photographers and graphic designers I\u0027ve always wanted to work with!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e This extra support will allow me to take time out to shoot with them more often or commission pretty graphics from, thus bringing YOU amazing, shiny new content you\u0027ve been asking for! I hope to be able to finish one new cosplay each month as well with this kind of AMAZING support! To not have to go \"out of pocket\" on cosplay anymore would absolutely be a dream come true.",

With this being reached, I would at last be able to get some tools of the trade that I\u0027ve been missing-- and replace some of my tattered old bits. Ill be able to replace my brushes with loose bristles, toss out my dried up paints to start brand new, and obtain more worbla/foam/resin/etc. to restock my poor workshop that needs it terribly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m looking to purchase a good belt sander, a nice dremel, a better heatgun, better adhesives and spraypaints, safety equipment to protect my eyes and hands, and much more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to that-- I\u0027d love to purchase some big standing lights and possibly my own LED light ring to help me make my photoshoots and crafting space perfectly lit (and stop giving poor lil me headaches from crafting all day in bad lighting.) You seriously have no idea how much this would help me, so THANK YOU.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",

WAHHH THIS IS INSANE!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve received SO many messages and comments over the last few years to expand my little cosplay empire in many different ways, but by far the most requests have to do with uploading more videos! More extensive video content is something that I feel has been lacking in my cosplay/art journey thus far, and I have always wanted to expand into this medium a bit more! There\u0027s nothing that will make me feel more in tuned with you guys than being able to possibly begin streaming on Twitch, film video tutorials, paint-alongs as I work from start to finish on original works of art, derpy karaoke nights, or progress videos as I lock myself in my hot garage for hours on end slaving away on armor builds, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027d like to join in that adventure with me and support me in the filming of video of my cosplays in action both at conventions and behind the scenes, consider pledging and together we can reach this awesome first goal! This will help me get decent streaming equipment such as a nice microphone, webcam, and maybe some software to go live with!",

I\u0027ve never been on an airplane before. Ever in my 23 years of life, NEVER. I don\u0027t get out much (sad panda! hahhaha!) and wild vacations for my family just didn\u0027t happen much when I was little. Maybe once this tier happens with your generous support, I\u0027ll buy that first plane ticket of my entire life and treat myself to an out of state convention that I\u0027ve always wanted to attend and live adventurously! Let\u0027s head to the East Coast! Let\u0027s head out of the COUNTRY!! Let\u0027s take a trip that has only ever been a dream before. With you, anything is possible.",
