I\u0027m Adam, though I\u0027m sure you\u0027re well aware of that by now; and I would assume you know that I\u0027m a writer, but if you don\u0027t then... I\u0027m a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tFortunately, I have been gifted with an overworking Creative Genius - I picked this up on a TED talk, thanks Elizabeth Gilbert and ancient Romans! A quick explanation would probably help. In short, the Romans believed that an Artist\u0027s creativity was from a \u0027Genius God\u0027 that resided within the walls of an artist\u0027s workspace. This was helpful for the artist, as it would lift certain pressures of \u0027being good\u0027 from the creative being; as one would be able to give all praise, and of course blame, onto an artist\u0027s \u0027Genius\u0027 - I named mine Barnie if you wondered. Ironically it helps to stay sane in this bizarre world of creativity, though it sounds rather crazy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway - as I was saying!\u003cbr\u003e\n\tBarnie is incredibly hard working, throwing ideas and stories at me full throttle, night and day until I have to scream at him to be quiet. Sadly I do not have the time, nor the funds to support myself in order to keep up with him. Every project I work on, I am left out of pocket in doing so. By signing up to my Patreon, you are significantly increasing the amount of projects I can take on and produce. You\u0027re also receiving personal insights into my life and creative process; and you\u0027re becoming a member of the team! A member of the family! You\u0027re also gaining a bucket of wit and possibly a few history lessons such as the one above. You\u0027re welcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy subscribing as my Patron, you\u0027re having a direct influence on what I can and can\u0027t release to the world, even at $1 a month! Not only are you supporting my current project, but you\u0027re also shaping my future work as a young writer, and for that I will forever be grateful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo please, come join me and Barnie on our wacky adventures - we\u0027re a great time!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMonthly membership subscriptions range from as little as $1 a month (that\u0027s not even a pound, British folks!) and increase up to $150 for personalised rewards.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.adamgary.co.uk\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003ewww.adamgary.co.uk\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
