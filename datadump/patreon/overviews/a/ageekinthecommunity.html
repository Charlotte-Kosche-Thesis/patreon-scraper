I\u0027m a writer, blogger, Twitch streamer, geek, coffee lover, binge-watch enthusiast, yoga advocate, social media dweller...I\u0027m a lot of things, but at the very core, I\u0027m a storyteller/creator with a passion for entertaining.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy stories and blogs often discuss LGBTQ or geek culture topics, as those two parts of my identity influence most of my creations. I like to think of it as visibility through art, and it fuels me to create even more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Twitch streams have been a great place to create community, especially around the video games that I love. Though I stream mostly story-driven games, I am very community-oriented during my streams, focusing on interaction with those chatting with me. I\u0027m hoping to get back to streaming some creative writing related content soon, as I want to be able to feature that part of myself on Twitch, as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(In case you discovered my Patreon before discovering my content, feel free to check out\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://ageekinthecommunity.com\"\u003emy website\u003c/a\u003e to see many projects that I\u0027ve completed!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eOkay Jeff, but what is this and what am I doing here?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eGreat question! Patreon is like an on-going fundraiser for creators. Patrons \u003cdel\u003esell their soul\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0offer their support in the form of pledges in order for content creators to reach goals they have for their creative projects (which I have listed on the left-hand side of my Patreon page). Hopefully you\u0027re here because you\u0027d like to support my creative endeavors by becoming a patron! Was that a good segue? Maybe? It\u0027s debatable, so let\u0027s move on.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut why do you want my money?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eCreators often put a lot of their own money into their craft, which can create financial strain, especially in this society where we have to spend so much money just to survive. Not only that, but we\u0027re putting hours upon hours of work into our work simply because we love what we do, without getting paid for it! The money from your pledges would go toward better video equipment, resources to improve my writing craft, helping me keep my website/Photoshop (for fun graphics purposes), and to eventually lead toward a life where I can be putting out way more content than I\u0027m able to as someone who also has a full-time job to worry about!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eDo I get anything in return?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nMy undying love and\u00a0gratitude!\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e...and much more!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI have rewards set up based on how much you pledge per month. Some include behind-the-scenes photos, sneak-peeks into projects I\u0027m working on, and videos discussing my inspiration for certain stories/blogs! Even a pledge as small as $1 a month will get you ahead of the rest of my audience by knowing what I have going on project-wise, and seeing the content I put out before anyone else! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the tiers go up, the rewards become more involved, like getting deeper looks into my content, and seeing unedited written work that didn\u0027t make the cut!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePretty great, right?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor sure! But Jeff, I\u0027m like, super broke.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eNo worries at all! This isn\u0027t to make you feel obligated to pledge, but rather to say that it\u0027d be really cool if you did. If you can\u0027t support me with money, even something as small as sharing this page,\u00a0or my videos/blogs/stories with people you know would absolutely mean SO much to me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for taking the time to read this! I hope you decide to become a pledge, because there\u0027s definitely way more content in it for you, if you do! If not, I understand, and I\u0027m just glad you stopped by and checked it out!"
