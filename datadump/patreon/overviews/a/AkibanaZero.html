    "summary": "How\u0027s it going, everyone? AkibanaZero here and this is my Patreon community page! I make gaming, anime and other content from across the Nerddom. My current content is focused on anime reactions, let\u0027s plays and fighting game content. My goal is to build a community of like-minded nerds who love games and anime as much as I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy start a Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI started making YouTube content because it combined some of my favorite hobbies: playing video games, watching anime and recording and editing videos. I want to continue expanding my array of content by giving the community more ways to support me as a creator while making them good quality content they want to see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to support you in order to enjoy your content?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAbsolutely not. My content is currently available on free platforms such YouTube and Twitch. At the moment, this is not a job for me. It\u0027s a hobby that allows me to tap into my creativity and meet new awesome people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will I get if I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy undying gratitude! J/K! While that will always be there regardless of your support, I do have a couple of ways to thank you for your patronage. I currently have three tiers set up and regardless of which tier you choose, you will get early access to all of my anime reactions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy only three tiers? What if I want to support you further?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m the kind of guy that likes to take things in short strides (read: I suck at planning for further than a month ahead). As I\u0027m also new to this, I don\u0027t want to put together a complete system then have it all swept from under my community\u0027s feet. It\u0027s been the way my channel has functioned so far and the way I aim to do everything else related to it: driven by a collaboration between myself and the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce I have a better understanding of what are the best moves for the channel, I will update my Patreon accordingly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you plan to do with the support you receive from Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI treat my YouTube as a sort of side-business. Good business owners take their earnings and reinvest them into their ventures and this is exactly what I plan to do. My Patreon support will be put into equipment, software and better audio/visual assets for my videos. By acquiring better tools I can make better quality content. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to my Patrons, I\u0027ve been able to more comfortably set up subscriptions for Adobe Creative Cloud (for video and image editing) and Xsplit (for streaming and recording). I\u0027ve also purchased desk lamps to improve the lighting in my videos.The rest of the patronage goes to game purchases and savings for a better PC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s the big picture? Where do you see this in 5 years? Will there be cookies and puppies?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m not a 5-year-plan sort of guy, especially when it comes to the things that I enjoy. I do have a big picture in mind for my channel and if I were to put it into words it would sound something like this: \"A place for nerds of all stripes to come together to enjoy, discuss and collaborate on some cool nerdy stuff.\" Vague, I know. I\u0027m hoping to make this clearer as we continue going down this path together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to thank you for making it this far and taking the time to read through my diatribe! Regardless of how you choose to support me, through your comments, likes, shares and other means, you\u0027re considered a valuable member of this community. I\u0027m always open to feedback so don\u0027t hesitate to drop me a line on any of my open channels.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStay nerdy and I\u0027ll catch you next time,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-AkibanaZero\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
