I first discovered it London MCM Expo, and went along with it to my Mum at 14 years old, dressed as a character from an obscure Japanese game, only to find out that there was only 12 other cosplayers at the event! (Which still blows my mind, as you get THOUSANDS of cosplayers at conventions now!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/dRV1lws.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eMe at around 17! (2007)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CyT78bZ.jpg\" style=\"width: 339px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAnd me in 2014!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kept going for a few years, always in costume, but stopped when I was about 19, thinking that it was now time to \"grow up\" and \"be an adult.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, I\u0027ve only fallen more in love with it, and started cosplaying again in 2014, at Glasgow MCM Expo, and managed to snap up a trophy for Best Performance! \u003cbr\u003e------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy I Want To Do This:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to do this so I can start living the dream I\u0027ve always wanted. I want to be that nerdy girl, with fantastic outfits, performing her heart out on stage, doing amazing photoshoots, streaming playing video games, and maybe if I\u0027m lucky enough, even cameoing in a game! (That would seriously be heaven for me! Gaming is what got my started on cosplay!) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to spread this to the people around me as well. I want to bring on my cosplay partner in crime at some point, Asylumstar Cosplay, as she has so much of her own talent to offer. I want to hire local photographers, and shoot super cool things, which as a benefit you all get to enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve loved watching how the scene has grown in the UK so much, and in my adulting hiatus, I\u0027ve learnt so many skills that I can now apply to cosplay (My Bellydancing, modelling, and drag influences!) as well as there being so much better materials available to us now, compared to 12 years ago! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to continue that growth, and pursue making tons of YouTube videos, as well as travelling and performing at conventions, clubs, and parties, where ever people would love to see me! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo make that happen though, I need help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/oi1OiLD.jpg\" style=\"width: 590px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrom one of my favourite shoots so far (2016)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e------------------------------\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Goals: \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo! To be clear, here is what I want to do:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Up the cosplay game even further. Have the ability to make more than 1 or 2 cosplay characters a year, as is my current turn out due to limited funds.\u003cbr\u003e*Create lots of YouTube videos, covering, but not limited too; makeup, video games, live streams, comic conventions, behind the scenes, and live performances.\u003cbr\u003e*Travel more, and get to more conventions to meet you awesome people.\u003cbr\u003e*Hire in my best cosplay friend, which means you\u0027ll get double the content!\u003cbr\u003e*Be able to paint again. I have a degree in Fine Arts, that hasn\u0027t had the time to be put to good use!\u003cbr\u003e*Hire cool-ass photographers, to do awesome shoots, which will be available to Patreon donaters first, as well as being turned into prints!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI unfortunately have a chronic condition(Ehler Danlos Syndrome- Type 3) which makes it virtually impossible to work full time, and create the amount of content I have planned. I\u0027m hoping that I can start to raise enough money through Patreon and YouTube to get down to part time work, to really create all of this, not only for myself, but the wonderful people who support me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Amber.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6h03eZd.jpg\" style=\"width: 159px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
