Our comic is intended to make people laugh while gently illustrating that family is made up of the people you love and who love you, whoever they are.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to find 4,000 people who believe our work is worth a dollar a month.\u00a0 This would allow us to live, have healthcare, and take care of our little family made up of Bryan (writer), Simon (artist), our nephew (adorable runt who inspired the comic), Magnus (stubborn beast) and Twix (our little maniac). It\u0027s completely at your discretion how much you\u0027d like to support us, we appreciate it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe know money is tight for everyone, that\u0027s why we ask for a dollar. A dollar isn\u0027t much by itself, but when enough people believe our work is worth a buck, it can add up quickly and make a huge difference! \u00a0If our work means something to you, please consider showing a little support.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you show support for our work, it really is supporting our family.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you and BIG HUG!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Bryan \u0026amp; Simon\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
