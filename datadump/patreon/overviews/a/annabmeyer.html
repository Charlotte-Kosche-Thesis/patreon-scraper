My goal is to create a vision of your world in the form of maps and images that inspires and guides, you and your players, or readers, to experience your world in ways beyond what words and and traditional maps alone can accomplish. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ghmaps.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Ulthek-Promo-1-2Kpx.jpg\" style=\"width: 645px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal have always been to try and find a sweet spot between photo realism and genre styled creation. With my work I want to guide you on journeys across places you can only visit in your imagination, and make every imaginary mile be a memorable one. The lands of your world should be as detailed as your dungeons or city streets, the wilderness where you have that memorable encounter deserves to be seen in all its glory. To journey across your fantasy land should be an awe inspiring one, with sights and views worthy of the adventures taking place in it! \u003cbr\u003eThe past decade I have created a range of maps and images for gamers, game publishers, fantasy and science fiction authors. My reason to start a Patreon is to have an better way to interact with all of you who use what I create, and for my biggest supporters to better guide my work, and for all of you to be able to directly support my work. I have now changed my Patreon to a low monthly charge to better suit the ongoing nature of my effort to map the game setting most dear to me, the world of Greyhawk.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ghmaps.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/final-map-1024x889.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor over two decades it has been one of my main hobbies to map the Flanaess, the subcontinent where the Greyhawk setting has its home. My efforts has been very well received with an ENnie nomination and was the start of my career as a fantasy cartographer. As a creative person I need to have an outlet for my personal cartographic passions and this Patreon will be the focus for this going forward, to work out how to best map a RPG game setting and use Greyhawk as my template. The results, when completed, be released as Creative Common -by nc content free for everyone to download and use for non commercial purposes.  By supporting my Patreon you make it possible to create more and you get access to what I create during the process, get to tell me what to do and learn from my mistakes and successes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://ghmaps.net/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/combo3-1024x538.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy work will include the creation maps based on 3D terrain created using digital tools like World Machine, Terragen, Vue as well as more traditional work based on Photoshop and Illustrator. To go along with this I will also work on symbols, textures and other assets to go along with my maps. For these parts I\u0027m using Adobe\u0027s Creative suite and especially Photoshop and Illustrator, and a couple of special texture generating tools.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can pledge from $1 and upwards. By supporting me you make it possible for me to spend more time working on my Flanaess project that are my passion and deliver the results straight to you! Higher rewards levels gives you more influence on what and how things should look.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those of you that want to map your own world the way I do, please consider the Cartographer Level. You will get access to my source material and techniques, helping you set out and create!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for considering my Patreon and I hope that you want to join me on the quest to map some fantastic worlds!\u003cbr\u003eAnna\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
