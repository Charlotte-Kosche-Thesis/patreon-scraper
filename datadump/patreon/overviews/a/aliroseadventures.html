    "summary": "This all began when I quit my job. So, on the one hand, I should really thank my previous employer. I watched someone who was overworked and overstressed continue to kill themselves at a job they did not particularly like. After 8 months of working there, I was beginning to do the same thing. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, one day, I took a long, hard look in the mirror and realized something: this kind of \"traditional\" lifestyle might be alright for some, but it was not alright with me. I was NOT ok with working a good portion of my life away- especially not at a job that brought me more pain than joy. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spent so much time thinking about work, that even the small amounts of time I could spend with the people that I love was tainted with the stain of stress and discontent. The activities I loved were pushed to the side. Even the things I did not love so much- like cleaning my house, for example- were severely neglected. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThankfully, that is all about to change. I invite you to join me at the start of my adventure- as I endeavor to work smarter, not harder. I may not end up the wealthiest person in the world, but I don\u0027t intend to be. My only intention is to be rich in experience, in joy, and in bringing joy to others. Thank you for being a part of that happiness! I hope that I can give the same to you in return!\u003cbr\u003e"
