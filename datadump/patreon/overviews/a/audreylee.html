Within my writing, \u003cb style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eI explorer themes such as mental illness and health, disability, girlhood and feminism, current political atmospheres, and power structures and imbalances within society.\u003c/b\u003e My goal within my writing is to reveal the softest, innermost corners of life, to educate about narratives so rarely touched upon in writing, to start a conversation about these narratives, and to pull apart social injustice for all people from its core. In our current society, writing is a constant; it will always be there to turn to in times of need. It is cathartic and protesting all at the same time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the \u003cstrong\u003ewinner of the 2016 DeSales University Poetry Contest\u003c/strong\u003e, which awarded me a four-year, tuition-free scholarship to DeSales University (however, I currently attend Franklin \u0026amp; Marshall). My writing has been recognized by the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards and Columbia College of Chicago.
