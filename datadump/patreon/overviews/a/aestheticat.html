Art. Theatre. Cosplay. Short stories. If I can create it, I will! I\u0027m a bit eclectic when it comes to my mediums, and after two decades of honing my skills I am ready to release their fruits into the world. Be it performance art, modeling, or costuming, my talents are something I want to share with others.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI believe that art has the power to transform. I try to intersperse my art with my passion for important causes such as human rights and wildlife conservation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an example: I perform around the country as a Steampunk selkie. I sing original songs based on mythology and folklore with the aim of not only entertaining, but also educating my audience on conservation and imparting the importance of compassion for all living things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a writer with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English, and a graduate student in the field of Archival Library Science (hooray, old books!). I have studied vocal performance for 16 years and theatre for almost 20 years. I was recently accepted into my local opera and perform regularly with my Shakespeare company. I also work full time at a museum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy artistic endeavors are crucial to my soul\u0027s survival. For me, art isn\u0027t a means to an end: it is my reason for living. I want to share my work with others and perhaps walk away having left the world a bit brighter for my efforts.\u003cbr\u003e"

With gears, of course. I put together each costume myself, and mostly use thrifted items, though some things will need to be made from whole cloth. I will be creating a European shaman headdress and a dress that uses elements of Northern European and Celtic traditional garments. It is not my intention to be appropriative and I will do my best to be respectful of the cultures I am representing (I am trying to only use cultures I am descended from and religions I practice). Of course, there will be may Steampunk additions to the costume!",
