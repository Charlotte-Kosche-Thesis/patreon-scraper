    "summary": "We\u0027ve been rescuing old 16mm films from dumpsters and obscurity for nearly 20 years. We\u0027ve amassed over 25,000 reels of film that we want to share with the world. We doing monthly screenings in NC, occasionally tour, make DVD compilations and put films online but it\u0027s just not enough. We\u0027ve only seen around a third of our collection - that leaves over 18,000 films we\u0027ve not watched or shared!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, we did a Watch-a-thon where we watched 100 films in a 24 hour period and we streamed it all online. It was so successful we\u0027d like to do a 2 hour streamcast every month. We\u0027ll pick a topic, pull some films, watch them and comment on them live. It\u0027ll be A/V Geeks founder, Skip Elsheimer, and maybe a guest watching and commenting on the films (not during the films - that would be rude!) after we watch them. We\u0027ll stream it live and then share the films we\u0027ve digitized on Archive.org. We\u0027ll also put the streamed show on YouTube, Facebook, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso, with your help, we\u0027ll be digitizing more films from the collection that we\u0027ve not seen - over 2500 films and counting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour pledges will help us with the expenses of doing all this - internet costs, acquiring new films, supplies to maintain the films and equipment, hard drives, snacks, aspirin, etc."
