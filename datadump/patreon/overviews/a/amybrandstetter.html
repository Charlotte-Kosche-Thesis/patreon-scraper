I appreciate you taking a look at what I\u0027m up to and I hope you wanna come along on this journey with me! A little about myself,\u003cstrong\u003e I love to make people feel beautiful. I love to be nude and I really love to create art with both of those things in mind.\u003c/strong\u003e I wear my heart on my sleeve, but truly, I am a badass bitch who doesn\u0027t put up with shit and really likes to promotes kindness. I am really an appreciative person!! I love my followers more than I can express. I see you, I value you and I love the diversity of each one of you. My love for nature, photography and the human body allows me to take all of my passions and create beautiful stories with imagery. I own a lingerie store!! hahah! YES! Everything sexy! \u003cstrong\u003eIm a Scorpio and an animalistic sexual creature!\u003c/strong\u003e I believe in EFFORT! If you want it, don\u0027t reach for it, GRAB it!! Its yours for the taking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you become a patron, you will get to view all of my uncensored art!!! And I do A LOT of shoots! Having you support me will allow me to do more shoots in so many different places. Creating these beautiful images take a lot of time, money and organizing! Its a passion of mine, so I am not complaining! Its really just having the extra cash flow that holds me back from doing that much more. I do work with a few professional photographers ( which is ideal but costly ) other than that, I do a lot of the productions myself. Thankfully I have my lingerie store to help me with wardrobe and inspirations but with your help, I would purchase a new camera and go on to some different locations as well as get to work with photographers that I find inspiration from.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I hope to see you following me! I promise you so much amazing visual stimulization along the way. Xxx"
