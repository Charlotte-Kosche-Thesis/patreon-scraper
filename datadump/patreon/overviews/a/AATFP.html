    "summary": "Thank you for being with us on our journey as a band for almost ten Years now. \u00a0You have supported our first CD release of Painted Truth on December 21st 2012, have helped us raised funds for the upcoming \"Key Of You\" recorded in 432hz, and have joined us on our Sunday Songwriting journeys and challenges at \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/avivasingsout\"\u003ewww.youtube.com/avivasingsout\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 This journey began in the town of West Hempstead, Long Island and some parallel universes like South Africa and Atlanta, GA. \u00a0Aviva grew up in West Hempstead where she wrote songs for as long as she remembered being alive. \u00a0A good student of piano and trumpet, she played in front of her first huge audience with an award winning composition at 8 years old. \u00a0She was recognized as Most Musical her Senior year of high school and wasn\u0027t sure if her peers knew what musical meant beyond the notes she played.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 No, the heart wrenching experiences that brought the music out of her was mysterious and personal. \u00a0To have a career in music without it being her own music felt empty. \u00a0And so she found her community of Flying Penguins gathered in Atlanta, GA starting with Simon Xulu.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Simon Xulu came to the US from apartheid South Africa to tour with a dance troupe including his two brothers. \u00a0His real dream has always been music. \u00a0Highly talented in singing, dancing and acting, it seems effortless to hear him harmonize as if it is coming from a divine place. \u00a0Isaac Xulu joined the band for the second studio album set to release soon enough.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Bobby Andre is the other penguin staple along with the talented dancing Jenny Nichols. \u00a0The multi-cultural band has performed at outside solar-powered stages \u0026amp; festivals, coffee shops, and music venues such as cafe 290, Steve\u0027s Live Musice, Smith\u0027s Olde Bar, Red Light Cafe, etc. \u00a0And has toured up the east coast several times along with Colorado, Michigan and California. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 For the past 5 years Aviva has been writing a song almost every week or featuring a local songwriter in the weekly youtube \u00a0\"Sunday Songwriting\" She has gotten loads of feedback about the messages and content being much needed positive energy for this often beat down world. \u00a0Often she adds motivational talks on her healing journey as well as relaxation exercises and recipes. \u00a0She spends 10-60 hrs on each episode including writing, filming, traveling in some cases, and editing. \u00a0Up until now as we await Episode #176 (hopefully with the help of Patreon) she has not received any monetary support or sponsorship.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 The album has been halted since the studio she was working with has been under a transformation and thus needs to renegotiate and get more funds. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 But all is well as the music never stops. \u00a0This story continues and shows keep getting booked. \u00a0We would love to play at a town near you. \u00a0We have accomplished quite a bit with small donors here and there. \u00a0We are excited to see what a steady flow of income through dedicated backers like you can do for our mobility, productivity, and growth.\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Besides finishing \"Key Of You\" as a major milestone we have half a dozen music videos ready to film with proper backing. \u00a0And we plan to keep them coming. \u00a0We are exciting about what is to come and what is already here. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0 Having your backing allows us to finish these and begin more projects as we hire talented teams of artists and musicians for videos, recordings and tours. \u00a0Money facilitates us reaching a broader audience through proper promotion and advertising. And the backing allows us to make a living doing more of what we love, music, with all of its heart wrenching, rich, and inspiring energy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThank you. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eLove You. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eWe are honored to share this journey with you.\u003cbr\u003e"
