Your contribution will also pay back immediately:\u00a0Your monthly support will literally buy us time that will be invested straight into new art against agony materials - and regardless if you are a die hard fan or merely acquainted with our project, we are incredibly humbled by any range of contribution, because after all you are the reason why there is art against agony.\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WRW141kSCI\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003ch4\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WRW141kSCI\"\u003eART AGAINST AGONY - SHIVA APPRECIATION SOCIETY - NEW ALBUM 2018\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/h4\u003eWhat\u0027s next for 2018?
