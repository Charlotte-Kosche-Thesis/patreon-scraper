My function is finding who owns the rights to songs that were released once upon a long ago but never reissued again. Many of these songs have been lost for 40, 45, or 50 years\u00a0and I want to bring them out of obscurity to be listened to and appreciated again. We find the best available sources to transfer from and remaster to today\u0027s standards. To date we have released 3 LP and CD projects through crowdfunding means but have not been able to \"fully\" fund every project. The music and record business today is a different beast than days of yore and the demand for physical product is diminishing, so the opportunity to sell large quantities of a project is affected. This is also evidenced by the costs to manufacture smaller runs of LPs or CDs, combined with the obscure aspect of each project, which makes recouping costs ever more difficult. We can only produce 200 LPs and/or 100 CDs for each project, which is the minimum manufacturing quantity available. I understand the limited audience that is available for some this music but that is the charm of bringing these songs out of obscurity. Those \u0027diamonds\u0027 that you soon discover, that have been lost for so long. The artists themselves and/or families of many of these artists are very gracious, and grateful to us, in our attempts to put something together of great quality and value. All of our projects to date are available\u00a0at our web store located at area251records.org/shop\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0THIS IS WHY I NEED YOU\u003cbr\u003eTime and money go hand in hand. These projects take time and money to secure their release. To make these tracks available again can take as long as a year. This is where YOU come in. I want to be able to fully fund each and every project we do starting in 2018 and moving forward. Crowdfunding is limited in its scope because of limited time variables, all or nothing regulations attached to a campaign and sometimes the familiarity of an artist, which is detrimental to us, being that we work within the realm of the obscure. I need sustainable resources to acquire the licenses and fees needed to begin a project and pay for it as we go along. I want to ask you to consider being a monthly patron to our cause. There are a few reward levels I have set up to ask for your patronage as we bring these projects to life. The greater the patronage the more we can do with creating LPs and CDs. For example: We can go back and create LP projects for those that we couldn\u0027t afford to initially, and were only able to create CDs. Our current plans for 2018 is to release three projects. Would you be a patron and lets put together some great music projects!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first project for reissue this year is a CD and LP of the Rock Flowers. A female vocal trio who worked with pop producer Wes Farrell (Partridge Family). We have gathered all of the single releases including the mono mixes sent to AM rock radio stations to put together a 19 song CD (including the songs that were part of Mattel Toys dolls of the same name)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRock Flowers 1970s commerical\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht9YTSPjp6E\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ht9YTSPjp6E\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOther projects for consideration are compilations for Jack Wild,\u00a0The Clingers, The Banana Splits, Paula Wayne, David Cassidy and Tony Orlando. Our Colgems 3CD compilation is on hold because of the expense to put together right now.\u003cbr\u003e"
