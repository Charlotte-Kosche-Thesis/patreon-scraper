    "summary": "Dear future Patron\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ethank you for clicking on my campaign! My name is Tomas and I\u0027m a \nstudent from Belgium. I have a passion for creating videos using new \nproducts such as drones. I bought my first drone in February 2013. I \nbought the DJI Phantom 1 because it was the first true \"Ready-to-Fly\" \nquadcopter. All you neede to add was a GoPro camera, which I had luckily\n laying around. In April 2013 we did a roadtrip in the US and I brought \nmy Phantom with me. We planned to create a nice and stunning video of \nthe breathtaking nature in Utah and Arizona but due to strong winds I \nwas only able to fly twice. Despite the bad weather, I was able to \ncreate this video: \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWRw9ZeC2MY\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDJI Phantom - Incredible Scenery\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQuickly it became clear that I needed some sort of  \nstabilization system for my GoPro and a way of seeing what the GoPro was\n seeing. I searched for such technology and I found it quite fast. It\u0027s \ncalled \"First Person View\", you literally see what the GoPro sees. I \nbought the \"FatShark Attitude\" system in July 2013 and it truly was a \nwhole new way of filming things! It became much easier to frame my shots\n - reducing the need to re-shoot certain shots. My first \"real\" \nassignment was to film a beach concert in my home town. This is one of \nthe pictures:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://2dbdd5116ffa30a49aa8-c03f075f8191fb4e60e74b907071aee8.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/3027503_1421384540.1535_funddescription.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe\n next upgrade I needed was a gimbal, it stabilizes the camera. This \nwould add a layer of professionalism to my videos. In August 2013 I had \nenough money to buy such a gimbal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn December 2013 we went back \nto the Southwest of the US but this time I was better prepared than in \nApril 2013. We were lucky with the weather, we had clear skies for two \nweeks and everything was covered with a layer of snow. As a result of \nthese major upgrades I was able to create this video, Wild Utah From \nAbove. GoPro featured it as their \"Video of the Day\".\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/86347626\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWild Utah From Above\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis video even made it to some national news websites in Belgium. I was quite honored by that!\u003cbr\u003e(ps: at that time, flying in a NP was still legal)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause\n of the attention the video got, I was encouraged to create a new and \nbetter video, so I did. In April 2014 we went back once again but this \ntime I upgraded to the DJI Phantom 2, which came with a gimbal from DJI \nitself. It proved to be a much better gimbal than the previous I had. I \nalso shot in a higher resolution (2.7k vs 1080p) and used ProTune (raw \nvideo setting) to further increase the overall quality of the video. The\n \"sequel\" to Wild Utah From Above is called \"Aerial Southwest\". It was \nagain covered by some national news agencies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYMSGIa7bZI\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAerial Southwest\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn October 2014 we (my dad and I) decided to create some sort of small business (\u003ca href=\"http://www.aerialshots.be\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e \u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.aerialshots.be\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.aerialshots.be\u003c/a\u003e)\n to increase our exposure. We have done some real estate projects but \nwe\u0027re constantly searching for the next big thing. We want to expand our\n capabilities so we can create even better videos and keep sharing the \nbreathtaking nature that our Earth has to offer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn\n order to create better and more professional looking videos we need to \ninvest in better equipment. We plan to upgrade to a DJI Inspire 1, the \nnext generation drone from DJI. It really is a massive upgrade from our \nPhantom 2. By upgrading to a DJI Inspire 1 we will be able to shoot in \n4K resolution, meaning that we can capture up to four times more details\n as we can with our GoPro HERO3. What this means is that we will be able\n to capture the wild nature in crystal clear video quality, increasing \nthe immersion and viewing pleasure.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if you have some spare money, please take the opportunity to \nsupport our project and become our Patron. You will have our eternal gratitude!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again for reading this campaign (sorry for the long post ;-) )!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n- Tomas (student)\n\u003cbr\u003e"
