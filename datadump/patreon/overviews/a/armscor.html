    "summary": "ARMSCor Studios was founded in 2013 by me (Dana Beck) after the birth of our little girl. Because of circumstances, I had to quit my fulltime job to take care of her. I started working and reskilling myself, learning at first Photoshop and 3D modelling in Blender. As I had no art background, this was quite a challenge for me. I have always been interested in the military engineering side of things, so naturally gravitated towards modding military-themed games. With everybody and his mother doing US and Russian military equipment, I went back to my roots and started with Southern African military equipment, with a strong secondary passion for Australian military equipment as my newly adopted country. Although ARMSCor Studios is not exclusively focused on military equipment, it is a large part of what I do. The vision is to represent Southern Africa and Australasia in its totality more in video games and digital media. Fauna, flora, locations, culture, etc.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2018, my wife was diagnosed with a brain tumour which changed the family financial situation dramatically, forcing me to change my vision for ARMSCor Studios from the hobby it was to something that could help support the family. To this end, I added a YouTube channel and Merchandise side to the (now) business. Decisions on what needs to be worked on, are now more financially driven than before.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Media:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis side of the business is focused on creating digital assets around the Southern African and Australasian theme for use in video games and online media. When available, the primary focus is on sponsored/partnered assets, otherwise, I work on assets I can use in ARMSCor Studio\u0027s in-house developed mobile, PC and console games and mods. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYouTube:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis side of the business is focused on creating/cultivating a community focused around the core of Southern African and Australasian content IN video games. Showcasing games using ARMSCor or any other mods relating to this theme, ARMSCor Studios bi-weekly progress videos, military equipment reviews, using in-house created 3D models, modding and game development tutorials. Future plans include 3D animated historical military documentaries.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMerchandise:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis side of the business is focused on ARMSCor themed products ranging from coffee mugs to T-Shirts to phone covers. I plan to have a large range of products from simple ARMSCor Supporter products to positive and inspiring themed apparel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI thank you for considering supporting ARMSCor Studios in making the vision of Southern African and Australasian content IN videos games a reality. I am always looking to partner up, so if that is you, please get in contact with me.\u003cbr\u003e"
