I have always loved Halloween and slowly began turning my costumes toward cosplay as I finished high school and started university. The first costume I considered \"cosplay\" was an atrocious attempt at Misha from Pita-ten. It was a delightful mashup of pieces from thrift and dollar stores, and I didn\u0027t even bother with a pink wig. Next time, however, I decided to step up my game and ask my friend if she could teach me the basics of using a sewing machine, and well... Here we are today.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have met some of my closest friends because of my costumes, and I continue meeting new people within the online communities. I love how easy it is these days to find people who are just as passionate about this as I am and share my work with them. \u0026lt;3\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy both doing my best to copy a character\u0027s costume exactly and designing something new for them, be it a burlesque version for Sesshomaru (no one is safe from a \u00a0genderbent burlesque version) or a new ballgown for Disney\u0027s Ariel. I just love the opportunity to create things with my own two hands.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is FunkSoul Cosplay?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/funksoulcosplay\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFunkSoul Cosplay\u003c/a\u003e is my group - I wouldn\u0027t be here without them! Friends from my city and I joined forces a little over two years ago to put together a full Madoka Magica group, complete with weapons! We didn\u0027t realize what we were starting at the time, but now we\u0027re closing in on 1000 followers on Facebook. We recently learned just how widespread our new friends are - it seemed like they cover the globe!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat are my goals?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(149, 55, 52);\"\u003eMy main goal is to be able to keep up with my hobby and continue making content to share with you! This year I have produced cosplays at a faster rate than before, and I am just getting started. Unfortunately, that requires a lot of trips to Fabricland and online stores for pieces to complete my vision... I would also like to be able to attend more conventions so I can continue meeting new cosplayers and experience fresh locations. I have met people online from all over the world that have talked up their cons to me, and I would love to meet them and see what their city has to offer a geek like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to new conventions, I would also appreciate the opportunity to work with new photographers. It\u0027s wonderful experiencing each photographer\u0027s unique methods and seeing their personal touches to my costumes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course - the more resources I have, the better my cosplays can be! (I promise never to buy a cheap wig ever again!!!) And you wonderful people deserve only the best. \u0026lt;3\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
