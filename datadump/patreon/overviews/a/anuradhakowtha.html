    "summary": "Namaste and Hello. I\u2019m Anuradha Kowtha, the CEO and Transformation Consultant at Manifest by Design.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI go by Anuradha. Most people say it: \u0027An UUU rad a\u0027. But it\u0027s actually pronounced \u0027ANOO ra dha\u0027. The \u0027dha\u0027 is a mixture of \u0027d\u0027 and \u0027th\u0027 that does not truly exist in the English but is a common sound in most Indian languages, including my mother tongue, Telugu. (Might take a bit of practice on your part). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a proud United Statesian (American) and Brit (since 2016), and proud of the south Indian heritage from my own immigrant parents. I\u0027m also have a B.S. in Biology, an M.A. in Rhetoric. I\u0027m an experienced educator, researcher, editor and business owner. I\u0027m also an accomplished Bharata Natyam dancer and painter. Now I guide clients through this work of rediscovering who they are, why they are here and removing the conditioning that keeps them from doing it. And I also write powerfully about decolonizing and following the call, from within the fire of my life. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve also had the courage to follow my calling: speaking my truth, however uncomfortable, letting go of careers, homes, relationships and beliefs that are not in alignment, and pursuing that life of meaning and freedom that is our birth right. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstead of waiting as Ivan Ilyich did, to find out at the end of life that it was a wasted life (\u003cem\u003eThe Death of Ivan Ilyich).\u003c/em\u003e It takes commitment (and resources) to rediscover your why and remember who you are below all the layers of programming and oppression. We often have to back to the mixing board of life, and mix something new. It\u0027s an unwinding path to take back your power, reclaim what is yours, and let go of what was not. We have to\u00a0 give up being trapped by circumstances, our DNA and genes (and ancestral wounds), and our programming.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learned that each of us has so much control to transcend our programming and re-imagine  our lives, work and relationships in a way that serves us and gives us meaning and satisfaction.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is not easy, but it is necessary work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my work, and my own life, I do not have the luxury to ignore the systems of oppression that we all live in. Patriarchy, white supremacy, racism, ableism, ageism, GLBTQIA+ discrimination, hatred of Muslims, immigrants and so on.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bottom line: yes, you have a calling AND we also live in an inherently unfair society that benefits some but not all.  Helping individuals to navigate that is my specialty. If you\u0027d like to learn more about my approach\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.manifestbydesign.com/fulfill-your-calling.html\"\u003ewatch my video\u003c/a\u003e, where I guide you through the basics. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAre you ready to follow your calling to the ends of the earth? To fulfill your highest potential with bravery and courage? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s not a journey for faint-hearted. I\u0027m ready, are you ready to go? Let\u0027s do this!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd as always, if you\u0027re interested to give a one time payment via PayPal, that is always welcome.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/manifestbydesign\"\u003eHere\u0027s the it is\u003c/a\u003e and thank you in advance for your patronage."
