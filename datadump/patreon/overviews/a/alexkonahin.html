    "summary": "Hi! My name is Alex Konahin. I am an artist/illustrator. I\u2019ve been around the web for the past few years and have been constantly feeling support of the people following my work. I am really grateful for all the attention and feedback! Whilst receiving a lot of messages, where people ask me to share some tips regarding my technique, materials and tools, I\u2019ve started to think how to engage more with the followers. Needles to say, I am frequently failing at answering each and every email, because of the amount of work I do as a freelance illustrator. I see patreon as a possibility to share more of my professional experience, to help and inspire you. I do believe this is a solution for me to communicate with everyone, who is interested.\u00a0I do hope for your further support! As more supporters will get involved, the more time I\u0027ll have to upload even more and more content for you :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see my works here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/alex_konahin/\"\u003ehttp://www.instagram.com/alex_konahin/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.facebook.com/alexkonahin\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.facebook.com/alexkonahin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.behance.net/konahin\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.behance.net/konahin\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePrint Store:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://society6.com/alexkonahin\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

True, deep and beautiful, his work is fascinating people around the world accross the cultures and borders.\u003cbr\u003e",
