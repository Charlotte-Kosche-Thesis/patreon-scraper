This shows how a song transforms from a basic idea into a fully-produced, radio-ready track over time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of the songs on my newest release,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.andrewsullivanmusic.com/new-products/in-the-darkness-hard-copy\"\u003eIn The Darkness\u003c/a\u003e, began as basic song sketches on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help keep things interesting, I also post cover videos add the occasional tour vlog whenever I am on the road for a string of performances.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour ongoing support allows me to spend my time doing what I do best: writing songs, performing, and interacting with my fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin us!\u003cbr\u003eAndrew\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrequently Asked Questions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you on Patreon? Don\u0027t streaming services pay you well?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m glad you asked!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Streaming music online, from sources like Spotify and Pandora, is the new norm for the vast majority of listeners.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Why does this matter? Because it\u0027s \u003cstrong\u003eMUUUUUUCH\u003c/strong\u003e harder to make a sustainable, dependable income with streaming. Most people don\u0027t realize that Spotify, Pandora, and their competitors pay artists about\u00a0\u003cem\u003ehalf-a-cent per play\u003c/em\u003e. Yes, one half of one penny *if* you listen to a song of mine.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. This\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003e*really*\u003c/strong\u003e puts a pinch on independent artists like myself who aren\u0027t as established as the biggest names in music, who may get tens of millions of plays per month. I\u0027m just not there (yet!!).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. In conclusion: Patreon is a godsend to artists like me. I\u0027m able to earn a consistent monthly income stream from my fans, and my fans benefit because they know they\u0027re supporting me directly (and much more strongly than through online streaming).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this all work, in short?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write new songs and upload other amazing things each week, and you\u0027re a \u003cem\u003epatron\u003c/em\u003e of my work. As such, Patreon.com withdraws your financial support monthly, at a rate that you decide (as little as $1 per month). You can adjust/withdraw your patronage at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhat will you use the money for?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short, everything. Music is my full-time job. I use your money to keep the lights on, buy groceries, take my dog to the vet, etc., like any other small business owner. I\u0027ll also use it for business-related expenses as well, like travel, office supplies, and music-related supplies. Have I mentioned that I am a new father as of November 2017? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to patronize you at one of the pre-selected tiers?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eNope!

I know that life is unpredictable and sometimes things happen. I don\u0027t hold any grudges against anyone who leaves The Chicken Club, I promise!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Do I have to do anything after I join? Am I required to provide feedback or do anything else?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eNot at all! I always encourage feedback, because my Chicken Club members are the most devoted fans I have, and I want to make music that you\u0027ll enjoy. That said, feel free to say as much or as little as you\u0027d like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs this an investment program? Does membership entitle me to any sort of financial returns?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNo. I\u0027m happy to provide special perks to Chicken Club members (like exclusive access to my new songs, handwritten lyrics, etc.), but I do not provide any sort of financial return to my supporters. Think of this like Kickstarter, but with ongoing support instead of one major financial goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan fans outside the USA join The Chicken Club?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYes!
