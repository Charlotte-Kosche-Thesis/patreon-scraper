    "summary": "I\u0027m Jessica, creator of the new site \u0027All Heels on Deck,\" a place for women, non white women and LGBTQ to write about baseball. The site was borne out of frustration over lack of opportunities for non white men in baseball media, and a desire to showcase a variety of voices an independent platform. Male sports editors aren\u0027t doing much to change the landscape (see annual sports media diversity hiring reports), so we have to create our own way in. That\u0027s all I\u0027ve ever wanted to do for girls and women in sports, especially baseball, where I\u0027ve spent my career.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my writing career around 2005, writing for a number of small publications, and, in 2008 I started the blog \"Heels on the Field,\" later shifting the full focus to minor league baseball. I\u0027d mostly written about MiLB and it was my passion, so the full commitment made sense. Through the years, I\u0027ve written for Fangraphs, Baseball Prospectus, MLB.com and, currently, I\u0027m a contributor for The Sporting News.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn my time in sports media, I experienced my share of sexual harassment. But beyond that, I saw how isolating \u0026amp; unsupportive the business was for women. And I saw the lack of alternate voices across the board. Baseball writing and reporting was, and is, mostly by men. White men, usually straight. But when you go on social media or talk to writers at smaller independent sites, the diversity of voices is there. There are tons of women and LGBTQ baseball fans, bloggers, and creators of baseball content.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWomen, LGBTQ and non white women are not represented the way they should and could be. There\u0027s no excuse for that. It\u0027s simply too easy to tow the line.\u00a0This is why we have to create our own space. We have to open our own doors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the entire focus of All Heels on Deck.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy contributing here, you join an exclusive community helping to open those doors, and expand the voice of baseball writing and reporting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
