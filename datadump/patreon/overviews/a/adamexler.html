     "about": "Adam Exler\u003cdiv\u003eIt was upon hearing B.B. King\u0027s \"The Thrill Is Gone\" at the age of twelve that Adam Goodley first heard passion and soul the likes of which he had never heard before. That experience inspired him to want to express himself through music and the keyboard became his instrument of choice.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAfter graduating as an honor student and tennis star from the Buckley School, (he spent a semester at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy and while there was chosen as a member of the US National High School Championship team,) Adam attended the Grove school of music where he developed his skills for singing and songwriting. That laid the foundation for what was to come.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAdam changed his professional name to Exler, formed the band, Everblue, and on a limited budget, recorded his first of three CDs. The \u201cEverblue\u201d CD was a chance to showcase his original material as well as his unique lead vocals and keyboards. It led to gigs in many well-known venues in Los Angeles including the Viper Room, the Coconut Teaszer, and the House of Blues. His original song \u201cNo Pain\u201d garnered several top awards from GarageBand.com, including the #1 best blues/rock vocals of all time, top 10 vocalist of all time, and two more top 10 nods for best song of all time. \u201cBaby\u2019s Lullaby\u201d, a song he wrote for his son, hit #2 on the New Music Weekly AC/Hot AC Main Chart, #2 on the Indie Chart, and #6 on the Hot Top 100. It hit #1 in some cities, including Nashville, St. Louis, Atlanta and Los Angeles.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHe went on to record his next two CDs, \u201cThe Writings on the Wall\u201d (which made the initial list for Grammy Award nominations) and \u201cYou,\u201d which was produced and arranged by Mark J. Vincent at his Multi Media Music studio. \u201cYou\u201d features a cast of stellar musicians which include Adam on lead vocals and keys, Mark Vincent (Stanley Clarke, Dionne Warwick, Vin Diesel) on guitar and synth, Fernando Jaramillo (Beto Cuevas, Exsimio, Don Grusin) on drums, David Hughes (David Benoit, Chaka Khan, Melissa Etheridge) on bass, and Felice Hernandez (Neil Young, Josh Groban, Michael McDonald) on backup vocals.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eHis brand new song entitled \u201cDreamers\u201d was recorded with Matt Melodious Coe and the legendary Stuart Epps. It has garnered two distinguished nominations in 2015. One for Best Song in the international Song of the Year contest, and one for Best Social Action Song in The prestigious IMA Awards contest.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAdam also had the pleasure of opening for Howard Jones in March of 2015 at The City National Grove of Anaheim.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eAdam is a prolific singer/songwriter who has compiled an impressive body of work. His songs are full of beautiful melodies, harmonies, rhythm, passion, and hope in a genre described as a soulful, universal rock/pop sound.\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003ewww.reverbnation.com/adamexler\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003eWww.adamexler.com\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u00a0\u003c/div\u003e",
