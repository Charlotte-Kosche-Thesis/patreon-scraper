Specifically, I started making this game because I love the meta elements of loot games and dungeon crawlers (the Diablo series, the Borderlands series, Path of Exile, etc.), and realized that I got more enjoyment from collecting exotic gear than I did actually using it in-game. So I wanted to distill the elements I enjoyed most (game economy, auction house, my love/hate relationship with RNGesus) and make a game that is built around a satisfying loot-finding experience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch4 style=\"color: #ff33cc; font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWhy art?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nArt because as much as I love combat-oriented loot games, I always wanted a fresh new medium for \n\u003cem\u003ewhat \u003c/em\u003eI was actually collecting. Don\u0027t get me wrong, guns and swords are fun, but making a game that focuses on the collection process was a good opportunity to pick a different context altogether. I\u0027ve always loved art, and it seemed like a perfect candidate. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch4 style=\"color: #ff33cc; font-weight: bold;\"\u003eWho is working on this?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m a beer-loving software engineer with a keen interest in game design. I\u0027ve been working solo on this as a passion project for about 3 years now, spending more hours than I can count and many late nights. That being said, I am always open to talking to other developers/designers about collaborating. The game has come a long way, and has even longer to go. With even a few more qualified people contributing, I\u0027m sure this game will fulfill its potential and find success.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch4 style=\"color: #ff33cc; font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow do I play?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst, go to artfunkelgame.com, find the registration page, enter your email address in the proper field, and press the \"request key\" button. Your request should be approved shortly, at which point you will get an email with your code. Go back to the registration page, fill out all of the information, and enter the code into the \"beta key\" field. Hitting \"register\" should get you in there like swimwear. Once your account is created a tutorial of sorts will walk you through the basic elements.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ch4 style=\"color: #ff33cc; font-weight: bold;\"\u003eHow do I filter my gmail account by attached file size?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI.....

Fair enough. To filter your gmail by attachment size, you can just add \"size:50000\" or whatever value you want in the actual search field.

A lot of the older, more recognizable works in the game are considered part of the public domain, which means people can use images of the artwork without a cost. There are a handful of organizations/museums that have actually made their entire collections licensed under public domain, which is amazing. Go support museums! However, there is also a lot of art in the game that has a specific license associated with it, often controlled by some kind of estate or the actual artist if they\u0027re still living. These are the folks I need to get in touch with, preferably with a plan or some kind of proposal about how I will use their work. For that, I need a professional. $400 per month, after server costs, should reserve me a few extra bucks to spend on someone that can help me draft the things I need to draft and contact the folks I need to contact.\u003cbr\u003e",
