And I that is when I committed to the firewalk. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the fire burned down to coals, the walk began.\u00a0 We lined up and started to approach the burning coals.\u00a0 The heat from the coals was intense (around 1000 degrees ) and my heart felt like it was going to fly out of my chest.\u00a0 The drums were playing and I was surrounded by dozens of people who loved me and I took the first step.\u00a0 And the next.\u00a0 And the next.\u00a0 And suddenly I was standing on the grass.\u00a0 I was higher than a kite and crying and laughing and it was truly one of the most profound experiences I\u0027ve ever done.\u00a0 If I can walk on fire I can do anything.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s a lot more to my life and as you get to know me I\u0027ll share it with you.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e"
