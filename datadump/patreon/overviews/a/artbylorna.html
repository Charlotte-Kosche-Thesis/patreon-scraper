I\u0027m an artist, certified art instructor, communicator, and aspiring designer. My main goal in life? To love and be loved in return. But not like... LOVE LOVE... but just like... family/acquaintance/we all happy together kind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suffer/struggle, however one would put that, from Epilepsy and am currently at severe risk for SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy) and I don\u0027t want to scare any of you away, so please feel free to ask questions, chat with me, or whatever makes you feel comfortable. I try my absolute best to be motivated, positive, and conversational, though there are days/weeks where I can fall quite and struggling with mental health issues. But I love everyone, even if some make me kinda crazy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy PASSION is artwork. I love Comic Art and Painting. Because of the struggles with my brain, my comic/drawing fell a little behind, but I\u0027ve gotten the chance to advance my paintings and get them hung up in areas around town!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYOU can be apart of my journey for some sort of recovery, getting my art out in the world, and straight up just... connecting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
