    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alana Bloom \u0026amp; I\u0027m an artist.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMY JOURNEY\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt sixteen my dad gave me my first acoustic guitar and something started to flourish, over the following ten years I watered and fed this relationship with my voice and my writing as my own practice and development. When I met a group of singer/songwriter artists called the Lyrical Nomads I was inspired, encouraged by some of these ridiculously talented artists I began to pour more and more time into writing and singing. Even more so when I met my dearest friend Chloe, who began to speak to my soul and I began to sing with, amongst friends, in social situations, and bit by bit we grew, I grew and my songs began to bud, flower and open into full blown stories and journeys.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn November 2017 I made the decision to follow this flow, the wonder of singing and writing, to begin the journey of sharing my music that I had been working on for 10 years. I\u0027d been asked time and time again where and when can people hear more, and so the time is now!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the month since I made that decision, I\u0027ve performed at a few beautifully intimate living room gigs, at the launch of the Imaginarium, for the Psychedelic Society and Sunday Assembly and I even have a beautiful and surreal gig, supporting a dear friend of mine Dizreali. Nothing feels more confirming that this is something I should be doing than the opportunities that keep presenting themselves and the feedback I have been receiving!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHE SONGS.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe songs that I am singing are coming from somewhere deep, somewhere that sometimes surprises me. The connection I have felt with people through singing them is powerful and the connection I have cultivated with myself through this ten year process has been a deep \u0026amp; slow rooting down into ancient understanding. My experience within ritual, ceremony, dance, performance, circus, physical theatre, facilitation clown, the sacred, the profane, it has all been integral to arrive into this place with my music.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd I dive, further on, deeper still.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe theme\u0027s that have emerged have begun to formulate what feels like a coherent album about nature, blooming, budding, emerging, I guess it is a reflection of the theme\u0027s within my life during this time. I would love to have the opportunity to play this music live and see the world of each song expand and I be given the time space and financial support to record, play \u0026amp; develop this music.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe songs I have been writing are like snapshots of moments, expansive spaces, thoughts, lovers, experiences. They speak of love, heartbreak, grief, our connection with the world and everything within. They have come from weekends wild camping on beaches, meandering down country lanes picking ripe berries, they have come from frosty mornings in bed, from utter despair, from all consuming love, from the understanding that I am already whole. They come from my own relationship with natural world, my fierce need to protect it, to witness it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eINTENTION \u0026amp; SUSTAINABILITY\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, I\u0027d like to begin how I intend to continue and for my creative endeavours, musical and performative to be sustainable. I believe that it is possible for me to exist as an artist, it just requires the belief and support of myself and those around me, near and far. On one of the first living room gigs, we discussed Kevin Kelly\u0027s idea about how if every artist had 1000 true fans who were all willing to pay \u00a350 a year for that artist to continue creating work and existing then it would be sustainable for that artist to live solely from the work they create. I believe this is possible! \u003cem\u003eI believe it with all my being\u003c/em\u003e that what I am doing is needed, is relevant, it feels right and needs to grow.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is why\u00a0Patreon is such an incredible platform and it give\u0027s me the chance to make a way for myself in the world doing the things that I love and adore as an artist and be supported by a wider community. There\u0027s is an abundance of money, of food, of love and soul nourishment, and so I am calling in that abundance, the ability to solely focus on giving, serving with the potential I have to create. Help be part of that journey, help put more creativity and art into the world. It\u0027s needed now more than ever.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Belief \u0026amp; Awe\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn Gratitude\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlana Bloom\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eInstagram\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alanablooms/\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTwitter\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/alanabloom\"\u003eHere\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCan\u0027t commit monthly but want to make a one of contribution? \u003cbr\u003eHuzzah Hurrah!
