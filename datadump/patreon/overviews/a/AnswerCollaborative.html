The errors are complex, and their implications for life and society are wide-ranging, but one way to sum them up is this: rational\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eindividualism\u003c/strong\u003e trumps attuned presence, \u003cstrong\u003eexplaining\u003c/strong\u003e (or worse, just plain \u003cstrong\u003etaking\u003c/strong\u003e) trumps creative dialog, reductive \u003cstrong\u003ematerialism\u003c/strong\u003e trumps complex-adaptive sustainability, and \u003cstrong\u003eself-interest\u003c/strong\u003e (along with its \u003cstrong\u003etrauma\u003c/strong\u003e) trumps human concern (along with its dignified peacemaking). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003e\"One of the best theoretical re-statements of \u003cbr\u003eguiding principles for effective leadership \u003cbr\u003eand personal wholeness that I\u0027ve seen in my career.\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-J.S., Faculty, Fielding University\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese mistakes are fundamental because no answer will help us to a better life if we are in error about \u003cstrong\u003ethe in-process, fluid, unknowable, always-emergent nature of reality itself\u003c/strong\u003e as we shape our questions, navigate the turbulence, and try to know enough to get along in the best way possible with the widest good-consequence. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Greek \u003cstrong\u003eHeraclitus\u003c/strong\u003e wrote that we \u003cstrong\u003enever step in the same river twice\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eTao Te Ching\u003c/strong\u003e starts by stating that the \u003cstrong\u003eTao cannot and will never really be a knowable, named thing\u003c/strong\u003e.

For this conclusion, he relied on his predecessor, the American Process philosopher William James, who wrote that \u003cstrong\u003ethings are known at their root (radically) by experience (relating in-the-midst-of) not merely by sensation (empirical measure from-a-distance)\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003cstrong\u003eJapanese Process philosopher\u003c/strong\u003e Nishida Kitar\u014d wrote that your personal locale (your person or your personality) is \u003cstrong\u003enot a point in plain space but an active placement\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0(\"\u003cem\u003ebash\u014d\u003c/em\u003e,\" place in the matrix) mediating resonance, reciprocity, and participation in the \u003cstrong\u003ewhole of reality\u0027s potential for Good\u003c/strong\u003e.

Because the worldwide Historical-Dominator epoch of the last 5000 years has worked so hard to tell (enforce) its truths (and poo-poo anything else as not real or realistic and not ideal or wise), listening is not something we have learned anything about.
