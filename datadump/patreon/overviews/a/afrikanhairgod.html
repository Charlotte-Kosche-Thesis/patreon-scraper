I started my\u003cstrong\u003e AfrikanHairGod \u003c/strong\u003eYouTube channel initially only as a means of sharing my personal natural hair journey. However, as my channel has continued to grow and evolve, my content and quality has as well. Because of this, I have reached a point in my YouTube career where, it is becoming extremely difficult for me to continue investing so much of my time, money, and resources to steadily produce such high-quality content on my own. By becoming a patron, you will become a crucial part in helping to assist, inspire, and educate others on health and beauty of Natural Hair all around the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my channel, you will find a plethora of things that will peak your interest. My channel mostly consists of over 450 videos detailed natural haircare education, tutorials, and demonstrations, which is based on science, chemistry, logic, and a cosmetologist\u0027s perspective of simplified and proper care of Natural Hair. There are videos of sharing my natural hair journey, haircare maintenance, \"Cosmetology 101 classes\", and product reviews, but I also like to switch things up just to keep my viewers engaged. I also feature some of my personal hobbies and creative/artistic outlets including \"Figure\" Inline Skating, performing duets and trios on my cello, and anything else random that comes to mind. I also occasionally do vlogs that discuss various topics involving hair and other controversial topics. I love to create dialog, discussions, debates to interact with my viewers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut more importantly, my channel carries a message to all of my viewers: to seek the beauty within themselves and not in the validation of others. The beauty industry is full of taking advantage of people\u0027s insecurities. I try to be an example to men and women all over the world by showing them what it means to define your own standard of beauty by always staying true to the person that you are, even when you are faced with adversity, discrimination, and prejudice just because of being different.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhether you love to talk and learn about hair or just like to watch people share things that they are passionate about, you are bound to find something on my channel that will keep you coming back for more!"
