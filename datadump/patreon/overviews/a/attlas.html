     "about": "Attlas is the name by which Attila Lewis Lendvai knows his True Self, his Innermost Being. Attila began a life of self-observation and meditation at roughly the age of 7, by simply following the guidance The Still Soft Voice emanating from his heart. It was in high school that the Still Soft Voice revealed itself as \"Attlas,\" a name which is more symbolic than literal. Its esoteric explanation is provided in our first book, \"The Attlas Project Volume One: SEE The World in a New Light.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAttila received an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in English Literature and Dramatic Arts from the University of Guelph. Additionally, he holds a Diploma in Television and Radio Broadcasting from the National Institute of Broadcasting, and an Masters of Business Administration from Wilfred Laurier University.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAttila has spent the last 20 years of his life working as an \"entrepreneur for hire,\" with a client-focus on business strategy and communications, primarily for small and start-up initiatives out to revolutionise their respective industries in some way. These days Attila limits his clients and partners to those engaged in what could be considered \"SEE Ventures\" (Social, Environmental, Economic). Attila describes himself as a \"SEE Venture Artist,\" in keeping with the broad skill set and deep comprehension of issues related to the establishment and growth of brands. He avoids the word \"consultant.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAttila\u0027s first passion was the arts, specifically the stage and screen. After two decades establishing a strong business base and 43 years establishing a deep, practical, functional working relationship as the voice/vessel/vehicle of Attlas, we are turning to the crowd to seek support of our life\u0027s work, in accordance with The Great Law. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0",
