I\u0027ll be constantly posting behind-the-scenes info on Patreon that I\u0027m calling my \"Insider Feed.\" It\u0027ll be like you\u0027re sitting next to me, looking over my shoulder, and seeing into the future of AFTVnews articles.

Patrons with this reward will have my guaranteed attention to help with any of their problems or to discuss whatever is on their mind. You\u0027ll be able to send me messages through Patreon, which I receive immediately on my phone, and I\u0027ll read and respond to those Patreon messages first, before all other communication.
