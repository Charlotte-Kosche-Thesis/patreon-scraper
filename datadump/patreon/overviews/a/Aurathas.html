Although, I will play games from other genres if they catch my attention! Also, you will often see Warhammer 40k games or hear me geek out about that setting as I have loved that for many years as well!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSoooo... Why Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eNow, on to the big question, why am I even doing a Patreon campaign? Well, while I do very much enjoy creating my videos and interacting with those of you that are kind enough to watch my channel, there are limits to what I am able to do with the somewhat limited free time that I have after my day job is done with me and my freelance work is completed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, with this campaign, I will be able to potentially cut back on some of that freelance work and devote that time to making the videos and content that I love making and that I hope you will enjoy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eWhy Should I Bother?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, by going with this approach I will be trying to create a community that you will not only be joining by\u00a0becoming a patron but that you will also be able to actively participate in. As such, patron rewards will include options that will allow you to get involved with the growth and development of the channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, thank you in advance and even if you decide against joining, thanks for stopping by and know that you are always welcome to participate in the community, whether it be on here, YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/aurathas), or Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/aurathas)!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks again!\u003cbr\u003eAlan (Aurathas)\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e"
