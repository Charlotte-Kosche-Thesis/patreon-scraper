I\u0027m Atlas and I am a performance artist working in the UK \u0026amp; USA. My work is a diverse exploration into themes that have included representations of queer identities, political activism and ecocide. No matter the subject, I\u0027m here to put on a show, entertain and make meaningful art that you as my audience can both, identify with, and feel proud of.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s face it, the world of performance art is secular despite being at the forefront of an ever evolving art world, that is slowly welcoming it into the throngs of acceptance. My art has always been about connecting human beings to one another and seeking truth. I need your help to continue this journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u0027As the weathered queer explains the process of their eagerly anticipated Spring display of women in a multitude of forms, and what pleasures lay in store for the expectant yet clueless club members, their words fill the air above my head with a warm and richly smelling fog. I sit in silence as I listen with intent, sporting an erratic - untamed, if you will - grin that I cannot shake; I could not tell you what the work of Atlas means, or what they want it to mean, but I know that it is needed and that I would not go without it. Atlas presents themself in cities praised for their diversity and culture, and yet they stand out.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0Presenting the queer and the mental to a vanilla and stable world, Atlas applauds those faking it until they make it and those feeling the burden of difference and uncertainty, and sometimes all one needs to get through the day is some applause! Because without that erratic smile that is usually so forced, I\u0027m just trying to make sense of myself, and I take comfort in that the majority of an Atlas audience is doing the same. They don\u0027t offer answers, they offer an escape and an informed perspective. Again, I could not tell you what Atlas means, but I know that I need them and that I would not go without.\u0027\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e - Peter Walker (Filmmaker)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you fancy supporting - maybe even contributing to - art that I\u0027m making, then check out some of the rewards on offer!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s have a party and spread contact where division is a rampant tool of fear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLove \u0026amp; romance\u003cbr\u003eAtlas x\u003c/div\u003e"
