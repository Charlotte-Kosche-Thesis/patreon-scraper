I\u0027m always saying how much I appreciate your support and friendship, but I want you to know that I\u0027m truly touched that you chose to spend your time watching my videos and chatting with me on Facebook, YouTube comments, Twitter and wherever else we meet!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBy taking the extra step to support me on Patreon you are helping me to continue building our community. Before now the majority of my revenue came from ads on my YouTube videos and sponsored videos. You\u0027ll know if a video is sponsored because I announce it in the very beginning of the video and in the description. I also use a sponsored link in my video descriptions to help earn iTunes cards. We all know free to play mobile games aren\u0027t a cheap habit \ud83d\ude02. Lately ad revenue has gone down because of changes I don\u0027t understand at YouTube and as you can imagine sponsored videos are difficult to get. I have had people ask how they can support me especially viewers who subscribed to me on Twitch or Kamcord wondering how they can continue that support on YouTube. Now I have an answer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eReaching my my goals set here will allow me to connect with you in different way, give back to the community that has supported me so much, expand my content through writing and dedicate more time to making more videos. It will also relieve some the burden when I have to replace or repair my phone and computer equipment. All of the money earned will be going back into the channel someway and I aim to be completely transparent with you the whole way.\u003cbr\u003e"
