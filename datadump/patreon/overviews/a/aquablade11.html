    "summary": "Why hello there! Welcome to my Patreon page! My name is Michael, otherwise known as Aquablade11. I like playing video games, especially games like Pokemon and Fire Emblem. Sometimes, when I\u0027m feeling really dangerous, I record myself playing one of these games, make some stupid video about it, and upload it to YouTube! Other times, I actually broadcast the playing of said game on Twitch!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you would like support me on a monthly basis that doesn\u0027t guarantee any reward other than the feeling of generosity, you are more than free to pledge to me here on Patreon! There was a time in the past where the different tiers had very specific rewards, but those have since gone away for one main reason: I no longer have the time to dedicate to the rewards I promised. Why? Well... I have a child, so... my time is rather limited.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays, if you do pledge to me here, your CHANCES of some sort of reward are increased, but unfortunately not guaranteed. One thing that I am more than happy to do on occasion is have a guest join me for either a video recording or a livestream! If I\u0027m ever in the mood to invite a new guest that I haven\u0027t had before, your chances of being asked are significantly increased if you are a patron, or have been one in the past!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, thank you for taking the time to read this, and please know that your viewership of my content already means a lot to me. If you are unable to pledge or simply don\u0027t want to, I completely understand! If you decide to pledge, however, please know that I truly appreciate it! Thank you again, and Rock On!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-AB11"
