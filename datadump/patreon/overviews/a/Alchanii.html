This page is not a memorial to what I wanted to do, it is now merely placeholder, for the future, when I can do this again. I appreciate whoever did pledge a few dollarbucks to me during the run I had of this, and maybe I\u0027ll see you when I relaunch this thing. Thank you. See you soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eHi, I\u0027m Joseph! Although the internet knows me much better by my alias of Alchanii.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIf I may explain who I am real quick: I have made over a thousand gaming-related videos on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/joey9909\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea now defunct channel that was awful\u003c/a\u003e that died (due to \u003cem\u003ecopyright strikes\u003c/em\u003e)\u00a0after 3 or 4 years of actual use that started back in 2008 roughly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI now live on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/HGAlchanii\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ea channel with HG in the name for some reason\u003c/a\u003e with roughly 700 videos made on it, where I do playthroughs of games that interest me, good or bad. Occasionally, I will articulate a thought into something that is longer than 5 minutes. I also do\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/Alchanii\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elivestreams\u003c/a\u003e \u003cem\u003esometimes\u003c/em\u003e, although I plan on changing that \"sometimes\" part.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, why this? Why Patreon?\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, problem is, I \n\u003cem\u003ewant\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0to make videos/livestreaming into more of a job-like thing. Financial incentive and all... But not like \"BACK TO THE DAILY GRIND, SIGH\" job, but more like \"A WHOLE NEEEEEEWWWW WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORLD\" if you catch my drift (\u003cem\u003eI don\u0027t, just as a precaution\u003c/em\u003e). You do not know how blown my mind was back when I was a young teenager that people were doing \u003cem\u003ethis stuff\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0for their job. Their livelihood! It\u0027s still kind of crazy, really.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe last several years I\u0027ve wanted to take part in this, but either a network or their practices would pummel my motivation to chase after an income on Youtube, or Justin.TV would... Well, shut down, and then not reward anyone anything on Twitch who had a Producer badge on the previous website, and make any numbers (followers, views, etc) not matter on the switch. This is not to entirely pin the \"blame\" on big websites that are, for the most part, out of our control. It\u0027s also a part of my own sort-of-fear of all this exploding into something much, much bigger than I can handle.\u00a0Where my optimism existed, there was a counter to it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhich brings me to Patreon - A place where my optimism seems well-founded for once. You guys - and that does mean \n\u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0- can support this endeavor yourselves if you so feel like it. I get to turn this hobby into a job-type-of-thing, and everyone else gets to benefit from me \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003efinally\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0making more content of both the live and not-live kind.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI want to be as transparent as possible with what you are throwing pennies at with this, as even writing this and launching this page has been a frightening experience.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. - Most if not all the money for the time being is being used to upgrade the hardware that facilitates video making/editing and livestreaming. I might buy a pack of gum sometimes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a02. - There will be no Patron-only playthroughs (\u003cem style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003ethat\u0027d be weird!\u003c/em\u003e), although I am interested in involving Patrons as Skype guests where possible, or having them suggest games, or whathaveyou.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. -\u00a0Speaking of Patron-only content, I will generally try to interact with Patrons as much as I can. I owe it to whoever drops even a dollar on me. May or may not make a video answering the questions that are sent in by these lovely people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. -\u00a0Besides what\u0027s been already mentioned, all of my content will still be available for free to anyone to watch. This isn\u0027t a thing where you \n\t\u003cstrong style=\"color: rgb(51,51,51);\"\u003ehave\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0to pay to watch anything I do. That is just insanity. This is for you to support me in this adventure, not a purchase of said adventure."
