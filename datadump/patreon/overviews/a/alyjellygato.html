    "summary": "First and foremost: You have discovered my Patreon page! Thank you, and congratulations!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...Oh, I\u0027m supposed to introduce myself? Oh. Okay then!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHELLO WORLD! My name is Aly, and I make silly things!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eSPOOPYTIME WITH ALY JELLYGATO\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eI\u00a0am the host of the video series SPOOPYTIME WITH ALY JELLYGATO. In my series, I review scary games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA lot of my friends from all over the country have said something along the lines of, \"That horror game looks so cool, but it\u0027s probably too scary for me!\" So what I had been doing is streaming my playthroughs of horror games online, so that no matter where they are or what they were up to, they could watch me play something scary and experience it at their own pace.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHorror games have a lot of depth to them that frequently sets the genre apart. Horror motifs have been evolved on throughout the ages, most having foundations in things that are traditionally \"safe,\" such as organized religion, literature, adventure, our own home. During my stream, I try to analyze where the horror for a certain moment is coming from, approaching it as though it were a passage in a book rather than a jump scare. In addition, I typically work to dig into the symbolism and the obscure references that some games bring up, spending time on things like digging into Biblical lore to further understand the Book of Knoth in Outlast II, or musing on the philosophy of the line \"My name is Daniel.\" vs. \"I am Daniel.\" in Amnesia: The Dark Descent.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m also an amateur game designer, so I frequently stop and admire things...like the half hour I spent trying to read the papers on the floor of a bathroom in the original Outlast. (They were illegible, and maybe also in French. I never found out what they said.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn top of everything, I like to bring humor to my stream. Honestly, the humor helps me in a similar fashion to watching someone else play a horror game. So be prepared for a lot of stupid voices, made-up songs (never sung in-key, of course), and the occasional \"h-hello? hello fren?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have recommendations of things you\u0027d like to see me play, let me know! If you are a game designer who doesn\u0027t want me to stream their game anymore, also please let me know!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cu style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003eIT\u0027S MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT: A HISTORY OF TODAY\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003eI process complex information by oversimplifying it. Among my favorite things to oversimplify is history.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHistory isn\u0027t just memorizing dates and events and names. Or, well, it can be. But that\u0027s no fun.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery historical event, no matter how small, had a whole series of things leading up to it. Why did things happen the way they did? What else was going on in the world at the time? What the hell is going on with their dresses? Who thought \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0was a good idea?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery day, I post a short-ish newsletter here on my Patreon feed looking at what Wikipedia says happened on this date in history. Most of the newsletter, honestly, is paraphrasing what Wikipedia says about certain things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOWEVER\u003c/strong\u003e, I do have a goal related to this! When I hit 50 patrons, I will begin work on a podcast version of this newsletter. It likely won\u0027t be daily, but it will be more accurately researched using actual sources and libraries, and narrated by me, in my lovely voice, maybe with co-hosts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY DO YOU WANT PEOPLE TO PAY YOU FOR THIS CRAP?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made the decision to open a Patreon after wishing I had money to get a new microphone for better voice quality while recording a stream, and also to pay for cat litter. Shit\u0027s expensive, yo.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
