I\u0027ve always played games growing up and would love to make it part of my job. Being a content creator has allowed me to meet so many incredible people, and I would love nothing more than to make that my job.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0Why should I give you money?\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\nThat\u0027s a good question - and the honest answer is... because you want to. I try my hardest to make content for people enjoy, and not everybody will. But I take pride in my work and want to help bring a bit of knowledge, a different point of view, and fun to games that I feel gets drowned out. I have been creating content on YouTube for over 5 years now (with a recent channel revamp) and have been streaming on Twitch for 2 years. I have already grown a sizeable community of my own, and would love to branch that out further. So the TL;DR is - if you feel my content is worth it.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(255, 255, 255); background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0What do I get in return?\u00a0 \u00a0\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(79, 129, 189); color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003eAt the beginning, it won\u0027t be much. An extra video here or early access to a video there. I hope to eventually branch out the content and to be giving back to you guys. I have ideas for community projects, such as a book club, a podcast with special guests, and I want to arrange community gaming events where we gather as many people as we can to play games together. This may change later down the line however, nothing is set in stone."
