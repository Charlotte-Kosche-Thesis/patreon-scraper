    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon page! Put your feet up and make yourself at home while I chat to you about how you can be part of my exclusive Patreon community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Antoinette Ratcliffe, and just like it says in the title, I make taxidermy, taxidermy based artwork and I also teach a variety of introduction to taxidermy classes around New Zealand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom time to time I need to enlist the expertise of a professional, like help with photo shoots, or taxidermy class assistants. Although they always say they thoroughly enjoy themselves and don\u0027t want to be paid, I value their time and expertise, and without their help my work wouldn\u0027t be half as polished as it is, so for this reason, one of my goals is to pay my assistants and technicians, and this is where you come in. By becoming part of my exclusive Patreon community, your monthly contribution will fund these projects.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving an income through Patreon will also allow me to spend more time researching and making work. The research informs the classes I teach, and leads to my students producing better quality taxidermy pieces... and who wouldn\u0027t want that! Achieving this goal also means that I will be able to spend more time researching and influencing ethical taxidermy standards in New Zealand. My definition of ethical taxidermy is using specimens that have either died a natural death or were humanely euthanised, these are the only specimens that I will allow in my classes, and the reasons for this always becomes an important class discussion.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFunding equipment and materials can be a toss up between doing more hours in my day job (I\u0027m a head surgical nurse at a veterinary clinic) or taking a little out of other parts of my budget... none of which can be sustained for long periods of time. Also, my cat needs to eat so I can\u0027t take any funds from that part of the budget!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd finally funding travel for exhibitions and taxidermy classes, as well as producing exhibitions are big ticket items - both things I\u0027d love to do more of in the future, and Patreons who get access to my monthy Patreon only content will be the first to know that they have contributed to this goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for spending some time in my brain-dump-goal space, I\u0027d love for you to join me on my next adventure of teaching more ethical taxidermy classes in New Zealand, and producing more pieces for exhibitions, it would be great to have you come along for the journey.
