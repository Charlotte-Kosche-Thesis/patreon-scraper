    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eAve, Patron!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWelcome to Autarch\u0027s Patreon! Over two thousand years ago, the ancient Romans developed a flourishing system where aristocrats of wealth and power served as sponsors and benefactors, becoming known as \"patrons\". We hope that, as Caesar was to Brutus, you will be to us - one of our patrons! (We promise not to stab you on the Senate floor.)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy We Need Your Support\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its inception in 2011, we have been fortunate to have the support of generous crowdfunding backers for all of our initiatives. We began with a Kickstarter for our flagship title, the \u003cem\u003eAdventurer Conqueror King System (ACKS), \u003c/em\u003ean old-school fantasy RPG designed to support campaign play. With its sweeping mechanics for strongholds, realms, thieves\u0027 guilds, wizard\u0027s sanctums, and magical research, \u003cem\u003eACKS \u003c/em\u003eallowed players to follow the likes of Aragorn, Conan, and Theseus on the path from wanderer to monarch. We followed \u003cem\u003eACKS \u003c/em\u003ewith another Kickstarter for the\u003cem\u003e Player\u0027s Companion, \u003c/em\u003ewhich\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eprovided a framework for custom character classes, class templates, and custom spells, transforming \u003cem\u003eACKS \u003c/em\u003einto a tool kit for judges. Next came our\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDomains at War \u003c/em\u003eKickstarter, which\u00a0brought epic battles and strategic warfare to the tabletop, allowing players to bring their \u003cem\u003eACKS \u003c/em\u003echaracters into a miniature battle system. Then \u003cem\u003eThe\u00a0Sinister Stone of Sakkara \u003c/em\u003eKickstarter\u00a0opened the world of the Auran Empire, default setting of \u003cem\u003eACKS, \u003c/em\u003ewith a starter town and multi-level starter dungeon to kick off your campaigns. And next,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eLairs \u0026amp; Encounters \u003c/em\u003ewill provide over 100 monster lairs, along with expanded mechanics for monster proficiencies, taming and training monsters, and custom monster-building.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut it\u0027s not enough! We want to release more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSpecifically, we want to release a lot of content for \u003cem\u003eACKS \u003c/em\u003ethat doesn\u0027t necessarily fit our big Kickstarter-driven release model: New classes, new sub-mechanical systems, explorations of specific themes within the game, short adventure scenarios, and more!\u00a0Your pledges will make this\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003epossible by supporting the creation of \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAxioms\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Basic Idea\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAxioms \u003c/em\u003ewill be a publication supporting \u003cem\u003eACKS \u003c/em\u003eand our other products.\u00a0Each issue of \u003cem\u003eAxioms \u003c/em\u003ewill include at least 4 articles crafted by either our in-house designers and editors, or by our talented pool of writers that are already active in the \u003cem\u003eACKS \u003c/em\u003ecommunity. Our hope is to publish an issue of \u003cem\u003eAxioms \u003c/em\u003eeach quarter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re aiming for about 5,000 words of content each issue - more if funding permits.\u00a0Everything we write each month will be released as a \"content update\" for our patrons here. Every three content updates, we will bundle up everything we\u0027ve written into the \"issue\" for distribution to our patrons. A month later, the issue will be released on DriveThruRPG.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDepending on the level of support we receive, the issues of \u003cem\u003eAxioms \u003c/em\u003emight range from a minimalist PDF to a fully-illustrated magazine with full-color cover and even a print-on-demand softcover. See the \u003cstrong\u003eGoals \u003c/strong\u003esidebar for more details.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhatever the budget supports, you can be assured you\u0027ll be getting the level of quality you\u0027ve come to expect from Autarch: Well-tested and balanced game mechanics, thorough historical and economic grounding, obscure references to a campaign setting we haven\u0027t released yet, and the warm comfort of knowing that a set of really complex spreadsheets is behind all the numbers. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for checking out our Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
