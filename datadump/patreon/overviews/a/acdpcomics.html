I started making comics in January of 2009 after having lost my job. A few months later I was running off copies of a 30+ page minicomic and spending the next few nights folding and stapling Scrambled Circuits #1 - a series of short stories about a robot named Primus and his attempts to connect with those around him. I\u2019ve always loved comics but never thought I\u2019d be able to make something of any value. It took the pressures of unemployment and a living situation change (among many other things at the time) to force me to really search for something to make me happy in this stressful time - And that\u2019s when my love of reading comics turned into a love of making comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince those days, though, I\u0027ve discovered that I\u0027m actually pretty okayish at tackling any creative thing I hastily decide I want to. I love old time radio and modern audio dramas - So I saved up money, rented out a conference room, and hired an actress friend and an audio/video friend, and I fucking did it. I\u0027ll do it again, too, and make more audio stories and then I\u0027ll make a new kind of art in the same way. Decide I want to do something, figure out what parts I can\u0027t do on my own, and find people to help me bring things to life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(217, 150, 148);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT BEING A PATRON MEANS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a Patron means making a monthly contribution towards the creation of independent comics and prose publications.

Scrambled Circuits stars the robot Primus in his journey to try to more closely connect with those around him: Friends, family, coworkers, strangers. It features anecdotes from his life focusing on nurturing creative impulses, reconciling differences with family, and the difficulty of a life of isolation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going through and working on the next Scrambled Circuits book.
