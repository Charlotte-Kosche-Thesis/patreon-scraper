Allow me to introduce myself.\u00a0 My name is Niradhara.\u00a0 i am a \u003ca href=\"http://www.agnihotrin.com/yoga\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYoga Educator\u003c/a\u003e \u0026amp; \u003ca href=\"http://www.agnihotrin.com/agnihotra\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKarmic Arsonist. \u003c/a\u003e I live in a primitive ruin of an\nancient Ashram along the banks of Narmada River. I am a grandmother from\nNY. You might wonder how I got here, to \u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/swarashram\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSwAr Ashram. \u003c/a\u003eOriginally dubbed Ganapathi Dharmsala in the 1760s,\nthere are temples in sight of this\nAshram that are described in the Siva Purana, thousands of years old. My Guru, Swami Anantram, an advanced Theosophist\nand Advaitic Yog Siddhi Guru came here in 1982.\u00a0 I met him almost 10 years ago and he invited \u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e me to live in the only actual room\nhere (besides his own). Prior to his passing into Mahasamadhi in 2012,\nSwami ji set up Narmada Interfaith, an NGO, so that I could continue to live\nhere and provide for the people of the local community. I shortened the Ashram name to \u0027SwAr\u0027 to lend a\nsort of street cred to Sw. Anantram\u2019s name when westerners began visiting. Swar is also an ancient esoteric path of Yoga\nthat i enjoy. The community here has given me a shorter street-name too, they call me Amma.\u00a0 I am a Sevaka and a Sannyas.\u00a0 I stay here because I am in love with the faces \u0026amp;\nsouls of the hand-weavers, street vendors, mothers \u0026amp; children of farmers,\nlaborers \u0026amp; all who are the sangha at SwAr Ashram. And I can not bear to part sight of this river, Maa Narmada. Swami ji gathered an extensive Library of esoteric\nphilosophical \u0026amp; religious volumes in his life time. Many of them i had studied over the decades before we met, \u0026amp; more i studied with him.\u00a0 He continues to download guidance to me, from the Astral, 5th Dimension.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Ashram, Library, Yoga\nShala \u0026amp; Gurukula along with the welfare of the community, Swami ji\nbequeathed to me to serve as its Managing Director \u0026amp; Spiritual Mother. The teaching of Yoga, English, computer access and the initiative of woman\u2019s \u0026amp; girls\u2019 programs as well as the management \u0026amp; upkeep of this Ashram rests upon my shoulders. Our Ashram \u0026amp; its programs could not run without my providing free teaching time \u0026amp; labor\nas well as the direction, management \u0026amp; financial responsibility of it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fall of 2007, i had my first\nNarmada Darshan. i had come to India after nearly 5\nyears in upstate NY at Ananda Ashram,\nwhere i served that Ashram\u2019s Library as resident staff Archivist and wholesale book wallah for\nmy first Guruji, Shri Brahmandanda Sarasvati, while engaged in Sanskrit study and practice as a\nTapasyin, and so became initiated into Sacred Fire, Yajnya. While living \u0026amp; working at that Ashram, i attended classes at the New Seminary in NY and became\nordained as an Interfaith Minister,\u00a0 Upon completion of my Digital Archives assignment at that Ashram, my Yajnacharya,\na friend of Guruji, whom we call Shree, invited me to Maheshwar to serve his mission of\nSomayajnas. The leela played out and I have\nbeen in India now for 10 years serving this community, a rural hamlet in the State of Madhya\nPradesh in central India.\u003cbr\u003e\u0f3a\ud83d\udd25\u0f3b\u003cbr\u003e\nMaheshwar, known among Hindustanis as the Gupta Kashi\n(Secret Varanasi), is situated on the Narmada River. It is said that of the\nfive most sacred rivers of India \u2013 Ganga, Yamuna, Narmada, Godavari and Kaveri,\nNarmada is the holiest. Hindustanis from all over the world flock to this\nhidden gateway for spiritual renewal. I have dreamed of coming to India since I\nbegan my life in Yoga in 1973, at 13 years old, but until this invitation came, i was\nnot prepared. In 2007, at first sight of my Mother Narmada I became overwhelmed\nwith bliss, wept and clearly knew that i would live \u0026amp; die here. \u003cstrong\u003eIt was the most joyous\nreunion, this magnificent wild river entered my sight and i viscerally felt that completeness. It is\nfrom this heart-space that I am enabled to co-create that peace, that serene\nsecurity that transcends understanding of space-time and crosses inter-dimensional pranic bio-energetic fields \u0026amp; then, to tap on the\nthird eye of anyone who so chooses to join it.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u0f3a\ud83d\udd25\u0f3b\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eAccording\nto legend, a dip in the Ganga River is supposed to cleanse one\u2019s soul, seven\ndips in the Yamuna is supposed to do the same, but mere sight of the Narmada\nhas the same effect. It is also said that when Ganga herself feels need for a\nholy bath of renewal and rebirth, she takes the form of a black cow and using\nthe darkness of the night as her cover, comes to cleanse herself in the waters\nof the Narmada, returning to her own banks as a white cow in the morning.\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe\nentire River Narmada runs along the Earth\u2019s latitude known as the Golden Ratio.\nThere is no other river on Earth that does this. In the center of Narmada is a physical Stargate, a Mandir (temple) many thousands of years old. It intersects the ley line\nthat connects Polaris to the core of the Earth. The sacred Sivalinga stone in\nthis Mandir is held by this powerful electromagnetic pressure known as Siva\u2019s\nthumb re: the Siva Purana.This same\nMandir can be seen from SwAr Library\u2019s window; and from that unique perspective,\nat the Winter Solstice, the sun sets\nlike an orange beam directly behind it and plunges its firey trail perpendicularly\nright into the River. Narmada runs East to West, opposite of other rivers,\nemptying into the Gulf of Aden, a more famous Stargate. Narmada springs forth\nfrom the mountains of Amarkantak, the account goes that as a meteor ripped open\nthe rock-bed of mostly black ironstone and quartz, the molten rock became quickly\ncooled by the flow of Siva\u2019s tears at the sight of this scar. This rush of\nemotion is our immaculately beautiful River Narmada, the only daughter of Siva. What resulted are the ubiquitously worshipped\nSiva lingam stones, formed by all 5 elements including the fire from and the\nextraterrestrial meteor, which are not\nfound anywhere else except in Maa Narmada River. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFrom this vantage point, I am creating inner peace \u0026amp; inter-dimensional peace flows through me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e..\u003cbr\u003e\u0f3a\ud83d\udd25\u0f3b\u003cbr\u003e\nThere was not much stability in my\nyouth, a series of traumatic events. My\nMaternal Grandmother \u0026amp; Yoga, which found me at a critical time in 1973, without\nexaggeration \u2013 saved me. Into my twenties, I worked as a seamstress in my Grandmother\u2019s\ndetached garage sewing draperies. I have always been creative and innovative. The skills I learned from her, I employ today\nin designing stitched menstrual pads that I distribute free to local girls to\nencourage them to remain in school. The intricacies of form \u0026amp; matter with\nwhich I became familiar, and the concept of upliftment of women\u2019s worth by its\nconnection to our creative hand work \u0026amp; our pro-creative powers, influenced me as an outsider\nsalvage artist of mixed media stitchery. I taught Yoga, Meditation \u0026amp; Sacred Arts at a\nmaximum security women\u2019s prison in Massachusetts and to at-risk youth.I exhibited my work mostly in NY \u0026amp; MA,\nteaching fiberarts at Nantucket Island\u2019s School for Design \u0026amp; Arts and as a\nmember of the (x) Gallery Collective. As\na grand Divine gesture towards assisting my exit of worldly life, the entire\ndigital archive from my 30+ years of art was stolen at the onset of my life in\nIndia, just after I sold \u0026amp; gave away every stitch \u0026amp; book, vacating my\nstudio. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe study of Hatha \u0026amp; Advaitic Yoga\nare continuous, though i am qualified and instructed to teach by wonderful\nMasters, i will always see myself as their student. It was my who Gurus have encouraged me to teach.\u00a0 After decades of tapasya, study, initiation \u0026amp; diksha, traditions which defy human standards, to satisfy peer pressure within the western Yoga community, I have been certified by the Kailash\nTribal School of Yoga \u0026amp; Holistic Health, in the Himalayas, as an Experienced Registered\nExperienced Hatha Yoga Teacher, E-RYT \u0026amp; Certified Yoga Education Provider,\nYACEP. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u0f3a\ud83d\udd25\u0f3b\u003cbr\u003e\nSwAr Ashram, my hOMe, is an aging primitive structure that\noverlooks an infinitely more ancient sacred River. The Ashram bears no indoor\nplumbing; the bathroom has a no-flush squatter and no wall on the Narmada side\nand abuts the jungle. Cobras \u0026amp; wild\nmonkeys are frequent visitors. There is no refrigeration, no glass in the\nwindows, and no A/C for the hot season when the temperature climbs above 115 F.\u00a0 The roof is tinshed with plastic sheeting\ninstalled over it for the rainy season. Along the Ashram\u2019s rear entry path is an open aqueduct that services the\ntown. I pump my own water from Narmada into an upper tank daily. My small dog\nKaliTilaK and I sleep, cook, eat \u0026amp; work in an 11\u2019 x 11\u2019 room with steel\nscreens for doors and a window that looks out, over sacred trees that are\nhundreds of years old, and beneath us to the Narmada. In spite of its outer appearance and knots of\nIndian wiring hanging in the trees like vines, SwArAshram provides the only\nopen wi-fi signal in Maheshwar for my students (or anyone) to use along with 4\nPCs in the Ashram Library. This has all\nbeen funded by the generosity of friends supporting my Praying with Fire, Yoga, Meditation \u0026amp; Vedanta philosophy \u0026amp; lifestyle lessons, creating Japa Mala \u0026amp; soon the MC pads will be available on a buy-a-set /\ngive-a-set basis. Conducting Esoteric Yoga Retreat Experiences is another venue to raise\nfunds for SwAr Ashram, and another way you can get involved. Visit agnihotrin.com. SwAr Ashram being a primitive micro-ashram, we lodge at the Gatehouse to the Fort, a 3 minutes walk, and I happily partner\nwith other Yoga Instructors.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u0f3a\ud83d\udd25\u0f3b\u003cbr\u003e\nGiven the politics of the time in\nwhich we live, it would appear to be a climate unfavorable for kindness among\nstrangers, but the spiritual orientation of this age is known as d\u0101na \u2013 charity.\nThe Latin word \u2018ch\u0101rus\u2019 from which the English word \u2018charity\u2019 is derived can\nalso mean \u2018beloved.\u2019 Thus, charity is not something done for the stranger \u2013 but\nfor those who are loved. Until more infrastructure is afforded to the NGO, the onus of this Ashram \u0026amp; its charitable efforts\nrests on me to self-fund through acts of Divine Love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWith this in mind, I ask you for\nyour patronage. A monthly commitment of\n$1.08 , $7.77 , $11.11 or $20.17. dollars (or whatever you are moved to contribute) will garner the incentives described on the side panel.\u00a0 Your generousity ensures my capacity to create\npeace between religions, cultures and economies; provide free services and educational\nopportunities to my local community, and aide in my ability to assist spiritual\nneeds \u2013 in India \u2013 and for you, in your own homes \u0026amp; hearts around the globe. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u0f3a\ud83d\udd25\u0f3b\u003cbr\u003e\nAn Indian tourist recently asked\nme how many followers I have. ?Followers?I have hundreds of Narmada Daughters \u0026amp;\nSons but there isn\u2019t a follower among them.
