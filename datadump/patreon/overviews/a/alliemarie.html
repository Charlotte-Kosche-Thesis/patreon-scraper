I have a huge variety of interests such as gaming, drawing, watching shows (mostly horror/anime), reading manga), painting, cosplaying, and sculpting things from clay. I take care of 5 pets - 2 black cats, a tabby cat, a ball python, and a leopard gecko! I have a few debilitating health problems and I\u0027m on here doing my best to achieve my dreams!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eBecause COSPLAY AND ART AREN\u0027T CHEAP. Each cosplay (unless very simple and made) costs around $150-500. Some can even be more! Art supplies aren\u0027t as taxing but it still adds up. Being a cosplayer that people can look up is a dream of mine.:) I do not currently have much income, barely enough to cover my bills because I have health problems and can\u0027t work much at all. (PTSD, severe depression, thyroid problems, severe anxiety, and I am now getting checked out for heart problems - specifically tachycardia) Cosplaying to me is therapeutic - getting to escape the pains of every day life to temporarily become characters I enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT KIND OF CONTENT WILL YOU GET?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027ll have the reward tier things set up on the side so you will know!:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBILLING\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon will bill you at \u003cstrong\u003ethe start of each month automatically \u003c/strong\u003e- so heads up!\u00a0As far as I know that 1 month isn\u0027t refundable.
