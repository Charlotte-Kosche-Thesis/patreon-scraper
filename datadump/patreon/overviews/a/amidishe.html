    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGreetings! I\u0027m Amidishe, and you can find me on Deviantart. I make 3D comics centered around giantesses and soft vore.  To me, vore can be beautiful, and my stories explore a variety of situations and relationships between giantesses and tinies on Miloris, where they all take place. And now, rather than try to tell you about my stories and my style, I\u0027ll let you judge for yourself! You can find my page and full gallery here: \u003ca href=\"http://amidishe.deviantart.com/\"\u003e\u003cins\u003eamidishe.deviantart.com\u003c/ins\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach image is rendered at a resolution of 1365x768. My stories can range from a few dozen to well over a hundred such images.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy making these stories, and while it is first and foremost a hobby, the PC I use to create my images is costly, as are the models, backgrounds, and props I use to bring my world to life. If my rendering PC breaks down, my usual production of images will come to a screeching halt. My hopes are that this Patreon will allow me to be \"crash-proof,\" and quickly repair any hardware issues that may arise without skipping a beat. Any other funds will go towards acquiring more backgrounds, settings, props, and, if it ever gets to that point, more hardware to create renders of even higher quality!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do you get out of it?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support me financially, you receive advantages in return, such as extra Patreon-only renders, knowledge and previews of upcoming stories, being able to suggest and vote on a scene with any giantess in my gallery to be rendered as an extra-large image (5333x3000), and the ability to request any of my images without the speech bubbles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading, and as always, enjoy! ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
