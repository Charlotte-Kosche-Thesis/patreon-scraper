He quickly became the head recruiter of the program that was ranked 2nd in the nation in NJCCA Baseball. His knowledge of the game and keen eye for recognizing talent led him to accept an offer to become a part time professional scout with the Kansas City Royals. Coach Medellin was then offered a position with the Carl Young Collegiate League as a head coach with the Sand Crabs. After leaving the college game, Coach Medellin took a head coaching job with Lutheran South Academy Pioneers varsity baseball team. In 2010, he began to delve more into select baseball and working with talented players not only at the high school level but at the youth levels as well. He opened his own baseball training facility, Hustle Baseball, where he currently trains some of the best talent in Texas. He also took on the head coaching role for the nationally recognized Houston Banditos Black high school team that earned the honor of being ranked #1 in the country by Perfect Game. Coach Medellin is also a director of USA Baseball\u2019s NTIS South Texas Region. Medellin is also associated with the prestigious International Power Showcase featuring the top players in America, where he is the head coach for the 13U/14U COMBO ALL-AMERICAN NATIONAL team. \u00a0Coach Medellin is not only a coach of the game, but also a mentor to so many of today\u2019s youth / HS/ college/ professional\u00a0players and counts it an honor to be a part of their lives and to be able to watch them chase their dreams.\u003c/strong\u003e"
