I mean, I found definitive proof that I\u0027m cursed by mermaids, soooo....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write stories of quirks, obsession, madness, misfits, strangers, and unbelonging. I write to connect: characters to each other, disparaging ideas, and narrator to reader. I write stories of questioning realities. I write the horror between the lines. I write lies and truth. I walk the line between reality and enchantment. Magical realism. Hope, crushed and fulfilled.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e...and what\u0027s that gotta do with you?\u003c/h3\u003eWriting isn\u2019t a one-way street. In fact, I hardly have anything to do with it. Readers are what make writers possible. We\u0027re all storybreathers, day in and day out. I wholeheartedly believe in the power of books, the power of words, but I moreso believe in the power of readers. Readers are a vital part of the entire book-coming-to-life process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeyond reading though, people are more than just storybreathers. We\u0027re creators. You\u0027re creative, whether you see it right now or not. That creative dream you have - whether for a hobby or a career - let\u0027s get you one step closer to living that out.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow does Patreon fit in? \u003c/h3\u003ePatreon is home to my online creative coaching.

We\u0027re creating together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne piece of you stepping into this bookbreathing world. You can support my story financially, but there\u0027s so much more. You\u0027ll give input into early pieces of the story process, you\u0027ll get behind the scenes sneakpeeks, you\u0027ll help brainstorm and troubleshoot and shape the story into being. You\u0027ll have the first chance to beta read, bookblog, and receive advance copies. After a book is out in the world, maybe you\u0027ll get alternate endings or deleted scenes or maybe we\u0027ll have spoilery discussions about just what this story means to us. We\u0027ll share fanart, fanfiction, headcanon. You lead the charge. What do you want to see?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the meantime, I\u0027ll provide motivation and practical tips for you to move forward with your creative dream. Whether it\u0027s writing or fashion, visual art or dance, crafting or cooking, I\u0027ll share my tips and tricks to moving forward.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support here will go toward the costs of publishing, towards fun marketing ideas that you can be involved in, and towards paying other artists to create more, whether through cover art, collaborations, collector items, I don\u0027t know quite yet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch3\u003eStill confused and wondering what Patreon is?\u00a0\u003c/h3\u003eYou can\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwvUjAv6pxg\"\u003ewatch this Patreon description\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0here\u0027s my take:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eLike Kickstarter or GoFundMe or other crowdfunding sites, but for ongoing monthly support of creators and their work.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLike supporting missionaries, only it\u0027s supporting artists.

And the artist doesn\u0027t have to cater to just one peron\u0027s whims, but instead we build a community of thinkers and dreamers. We can all support good art and make it happen and grow and learn together.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLike you and me imagining, collaborating, geeking out. \u003cstrong\u003eYou in?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
