    "summary": "Hey there, welcome to my Patreon page! Chances are you found your way here from my YouTube channel. And if you didn\u0027t, then this might make a whole lot more sense if you stop by for a visit. \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/asmrcast\"\u003ehttp://www.youtube.com/asmrcast\u003c/a\u003e :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHopefully you\u0027re here because you\u0027re thinking about donating in order to help me make better content. \u003cstrong\u003eSo first off, thank you for thinking about helping!\u003c/strong\u003e I thought I would take a little time to explain everything I do and how your donations will directly help me to make better videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaking ASMR videos is my passion.\u003c/strong\u003e Ever since finding out what to call those tingles in the back of my head whenever I experienced certain visual and auditory stimulation, I knew I had to create my own content. Through the videos I make I want to push ASMR further and find something special and unique to share with you all (and hopefully give you tingles in the process).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut making videos takes a lot of time. In Fact, between recording, editing, producing and voicing videos,\u00a0it is a fulltime job! \u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s why I need your help.\u003c/strong\u003e In order for me to continue making (and improving) video content, I need the help of people like you to afford hardware, software, props and costumes. Here\u0027s a rundown of costs to run the channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eComputer equipment and subscriptions to video editing software.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVarious microphones and external audio recorders for a low white noise level.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCameras and lenses for control over videography.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProps for videos (Pokemon, Minecraft, various interesting items to induce triggers).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eCostumes and set dressing for\u00a0role play\u00a0scenarios.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I do not have all these things at the moment, which is why your support is so important to me (and obviously things need to be replaced from time to time). I just want to be free to make the best possible ASMR videos I can for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn return for your support there are some really good reward levels available for you all to get access to some exciting opportunities, so please consider supporting me. I am also trying to be as transparent as possible with where your donation goes. What I am buying and how the videos are being improved with your help all goes into my monthly Patreon update videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
