The fact you made your way here and took time to read this is flattering enough on its own.\u00a0 Now I\u0027m inviting you to go the extra mile with me.\u00a0 In an ideal world, bills wouldn\u0027t exist, food would be free, and Hawaiian shirts would grow on trees, unfortunately that\u0027s not the case.\u00a0 I need your help if I want to pump the gas.\u00a0 So, what do you say?\u00a0 We\u0027d be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way out to the end.\u003cbr\u003e"
