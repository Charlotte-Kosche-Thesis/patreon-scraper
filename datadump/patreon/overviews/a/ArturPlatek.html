    "summary": "Ok. Now, when I have attracted your attention, let me introduce myself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHO AM I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\n name is Artur. I\u0027m 29 years old guy from Cracow, in Poland. I have a \nwife and a child. I work in a big corporation doing some \nreports in excel, checking documentation, etc. Sounds extremely typical,\n right? Of course I have also some hobbies. I love literature, music and\n wandering. I am also interested in history and anthropology. It\u0027s not \neverything. I have also one more great passion - writing. This is why I \nam here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO I DO?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI \nstarted a few years ago when I decided that I will try to write a short \nstory. I\u0027ve decided that it must be a fantasy tale, because it\u0027s my \nfavourite type of literature. There was a will, there was an idea, so \nlet\u0027s do it! Then I wrote the first several pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy \nfiance (now, she is my wife) was my first critic. I\u0027ve decided to show \nthis story to her. She told me that this is cool and I should keep \nwriting. So I did and soon it turned out that I have many ideas how to \nexpand the story, add new plot lines, upgrade the old paragraphs, etc. \nNow I have more than 150 pages of the novel (among other a few complete\n chapters) and about 50 pages of notes. In my head there is material for\n thousands pages.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY AM I ON PATREON?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs\n you all probably know, the most difficult in being a creator is to find\n some time to do your stuff, whatever it is. I need to work for a \nliving: pay bills, pay credit installments (for arranging an apartment),\n buy food, cloths and other things for me and my family. I usually spend\n in my work about 10-11 hours a day (including driving time to and from \nmy workplace). When you add sleeping, cooking and eating, showering, \ncleaning and other things that you need to do, you will discover that \nthere is not a lot of time for your family and friends in fact. Yeah, \nand I still have not mentioned anything about writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf\n course it must yield to the more important things. Nevertheless, I try \nto find some time for writing as well. At least once or twice a week, \njust to write a few pages or even paragraphs. Usually at the expense of \nmy sleep (Do you see any other way? :) ) This is why I\u0027ve decided to \njoin Patreon. I\u0027ve thought that I can show you my work and if you like \nit, you will join my patrons community and offer me some monthly \npledge in the amount you choose. Maybe then some day I will be able to \nquit my current job and fully devote myself to writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT CAN YOU EXPECT?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\n create a fantasy world inspired by literature, film and other products \nof human mind as well as the actual world history and cultural wealth. A\n world ravaged by escalating tensions - political, social and religious.\n A world full of magic and mysteries, treason, intrigues and dirty \ngames, but also sacrifice, idealism and epic fights. A world that can soon be annihilated.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\n plan is to upload at least one chapter each month (both in English and \nPolish). It is possible for me and it will be a good motivation to write\n regularly and concentrate on one story line, instead of writing some \nparts of this and that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like my work and there is a\n group of people interested in, I will prepare and upload some \nadditional materials, like questions \u0026amp; answers videos or some \nspecial information about the world which I am creating (e.g. a map, an illustration, a history of some place). If the response from Patreon \ncommunity is really positive, I will be able to focus on my novel and \nupload chapters more often (e.g. twice a month). The most generous \npatrons can expect a book with an individual Thank You Note (when I \nfinally publish my novel) and also... presence in my story! You can find\n more information on my side panel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSounds interesting? I \nhope so! Please feel welcomed to look at the prologue of my novel. I \nhope you will stay with me a little longer."
