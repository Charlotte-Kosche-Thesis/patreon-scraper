    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eHi! My name is Aria and I like making comics. Particularly, I like making \u003ca href=\"http://kiddcommander.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKidd Commander\u003c/a\u003e, my original webcomic. I\u0027ve been working on the characters and story for a very, very long time and am beyond ecstatic to finally be sharing it with everybody! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/eMTKa52.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs it is right now, the comic is updating with around three full-color pages each week. While it can be argued that this is a fairly frequent update rate, my concern is that Kidd Commander is going to be a very long story. Very long. It\u0027s fashioned after traditional ongoing shonen adventure comics, keeping close to the \"rowdy bunch of characters moving towards a lofty goal one episode at a time\" format.\u00a0 While this is doable for proper comic authors who can crank out a whole chapter every week, I\u0027m afraid the webcomic pace is just too slow for what I want to do. But that\u0027s what we\u0027re stuck with! So I\u0027m going to hedge my bets and do everything I can to funnel all the time I possibly can into this project.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://i.imgur.com/6Ur7TAZ.png\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/gqU6xO5.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery decision I\u0027ve made over the last few years has been informed by my eventual goal of exclusively creating my comic for a living. Admittedly, this is partially because I\u0027ve never really wanted to do anything that doesn\u0027t involve storytelling. Mostly, though, I would like to be able to finish Kidd Commander within my lifetime, and that\u0027s not looking possible at the rate I would work at if I couldn\u0027t keep up doing comics full time. I just need time so I can bring you as much content of the highest quality that I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/UIhnwhh.jpg\"\u003e\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo basically, for transparency\u0027s sake: any support means groceries and living expenses for me, promotional expenses and general upkeep for the comic, and more content more frequently for you! Due to time and money constraints I don\u0027t have a lot to give back to my supporters beyond the comic itself, but depending on how well this Patreon does that may change!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/6claJiW.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEven if you don\u0027t have the resources to donate, your continued interest \nin my comic means a whole lot to me. Thank you very much for visiting my\n page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
