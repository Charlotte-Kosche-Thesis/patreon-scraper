    "summary": "Welcome to entertaining enlightenment at its best! How long have you been on this spiritual, exploratory, transformational journey of yours? Taken any detours along the way (perhaps that you wish you could\u0027ve avoided)? I can\u0027t speak for you, but \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e have certainly taken the scenic route to get to where I am today, and I\u0027d like to help save you some valuable time and energy by helping you to streamline your journey. I\u0027ve devoted the past 14+ years to teaching, sourcing, and sharing the absolute best, most effective tips \u0026amp; tools for spirituality, energy healing, and intuition...hilariously, of course. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_V_nl1dHIx4?rel=0\u0026amp;showinfo=0\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\"Within the first month of working with Amy, she not only calmed my \nfears of a cheating husband, but then UNCOVERED and HEALED the root \nissue that was causing this fatal fear. Whew! so grateful, Happy Wife \nHappy Life!\"\u00a0 --Carrie W.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am passionate about helping you get clear, and I do this by explaining and demonstrating the shortcuts to take, the pitfalls to avoid, and the most streamlined, efficient ways to \u003cstrong\u003eget clear and get results. \u003c/strong\u003eWhen I say \"get clear,\" I mean two things: first, \u003cstrong\u003eclarity. \u003c/strong\u003eLike, what\u0027s up in your space, \u003cem\u003ereally,\u003c/em\u003e and what\u0027s keeping you stuck or confused somewhere (or with someone or something), \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e what\u0027s it gonna take for you to be able to move forward and do/be/have what you most want? Secondly, I refer to \"getting clear\" as \u003cstrong\u003eclearing \u003c/strong\u003eor permanently removing all obstacles such as blocks, doubts, fears, and limiting beliefs. Getting clear is my speciality. That\u0027s why they call me the Spiritual Ass Kicker and that\u0027s why you\u0027re gonna love the shizzle I\u0027m creating for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Wow. Where to Start? Not only has Amy helped me come out of the \nspiritual closet but she\u0027s also ramped up my intuition and help me step \ninto my power with a greater understanding of who I really am. Best of \nall, her badass business tweaks have helped me to get 4 new clients \ninstantly with plenty more on the way (this made me in the 5 figures in \njust under a week).\" -- Audrey M.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy Patreon? I\u0027ve been bitten in the ass by NOT listening to my intuition enough times to know that when I get that clear message to change direction, I\u0027d better listen, and quick. For years, I\u0027ve offered high-end mentoring and premium training programs, but now that\u0027s all changing. \"Time to reach a lot more people, Amy. Patreon is your new home.\" Um, ok. I\u0027m game. YES, I\u0027ll continue to create the highest quality content, as quickly and entertainingly as I can create it, and in a fashion that is well-organized and makes sense to you... but now instead of a fixed price tag of $1000s or $10000s of dollars, YOU get to decide what you can/choose to pay for these delightful gems of life-altering knowledge. And this makes my stuff a whole lot more accessible to more people.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"In the decade that I have known Amy, she has been my go-to gal when I \nneed to gain clarity or get clear on a problem I\u0027m stuck on. Recently, \nshe helped me through a very difficult situation and the loss of a \npregnancy. Her insights and willingness to share her intuition with me \nhelped me move through the situation and put my attention on the \nexcellent future outcomes with my family. Not only do I consider her my \ncoach, but also a great friend and ally.\" --Shannon L.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s clear where\u00a0my talents lay: CREATING and TEACHING and CLEARING. I\u0027m a total badass at those (as you may already know). So THANK YOU in advance for becoming a patron, so that I can continue to create, teach, and clear, all of which creates more PEACE and HAPPINESS on our planet. (Without marketing! WOOHOO!!) And I\u0027m pretty damn excited to take you along with me on this wild ride, because at the risk of sounding like a hippie, this ripple we\u0027re creating together is all about transformation, expansion, and awareness. And that\u0027s pretty kickass in my book.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Anyone who has engaged Amy as their coach will agree she is extremely effective. I have experienced this first hand. Amy contains a perfect combination of practical skills, broad knowledge, humor and intuition. Her powerful transformative process is propelled by her ability to assess the root cause of your biggest blocks - the things that are keeping you from your most treasured dreams and goals. The consequence of Amy\u0027s coaching is my ability to walk away from thoughts, feelings and behaviors that no longer serve me. Since working with Amy, I have been inspired to believe in my own potential and free to creatively experiment with new approaches to gain maximum results. Not only have I seen real successful results, but also I see evidence of how I approach life differently. I highly recommend her!\" -- Terri G.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Simply Brilliant!! Amy has a way to pinpoint the issues quickly. I felt \nso clear which in turn gave me much needed comfort \u0026amp; confidence!! \nForever thankful!\" -- Jen C.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWONDERING HOW MUCH?\u003c/strong\u003e On average, you can expect to see \u003cstrong\u003eone brand new creation approx each week.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0In other words, if you pledge at the $25 level, you can expect to be charged approximately $100 per month. However, since your pledge is \u003cem\u003eper creation,\u003c/em\u003e you can go into your settings and put a cap on the max # of pledges you\u0027ll be charged for in a month (if you want to...but be advised, this would usually mean missing out on some awesome late-month content and audio clearings). AND you can adjust your pledge level any time, in your user settings. Please know that I SO appreciate your willingness to support this ripple magic of \u003cstrong\u003eshift. \u003c/strong\u003eC\u0027mon, sign up and join me, and let\u0027s do this!!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Amy is a straight shooter who doesn\u0027t sugar coat anything. She tells you\n what you need to hear and not what you want to hear. She is a force to \nbe reckoned with no doubt! What impresses me about Amy is that she is so\n confident, intuitively accurate and such a power house. You literally \nCAN ask her anything! It\u0027s pretty incredible. She knows no fear and she \nis able to teach you that as well. It is so important for her to be able\n to empower you and not just give you the silver bullet that everyone is\n looking for. I think because of that, she more often that not goes way \nabove and beyond to help you succeed with your goals and wishes. Amy\u0027s \nwork is so unique and different it is priceless. You can not put a price\n tag on what she does because she literally changes peoples lives (at \nleast those who genuinely want change). I am truly grateful to have met,\n worked with and exceeded my goals learning from Amy. If somebody really\n needs a Spiritual Ass Kickin, then she is definitely the one for the \njob!\"\u00a0 --Terry R.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Amy is a world class healer that is effective and quick.  Experience \nintuitive rapid shifts and changes when you use her services.  I highly \nrecommend her :)\" -- Sarah P.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"One of my first experiences with Amy was a Heal It Yourself (HIY) \ncourse. I actually didn\u0027t even have the money for it, though it \n\"magically\" appeared within a week! As part of that course, I filled out\n an intention sheet, and one of the things I wanted was a large chunk of\n cash to pay off debts and help out my college kids. Within 6 months\u0027 \ntime, I received $50K!!! Honestly, I\u0027ve spent YEARS and THOUSANDS going \nthrough self-help programs, trying to find my path and live my purpose, \nand Amy is the only one who has helped me to help myself. Amy is the ideal Spiritual Ass Kicker :-D\"\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 -- Kimberley M.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
