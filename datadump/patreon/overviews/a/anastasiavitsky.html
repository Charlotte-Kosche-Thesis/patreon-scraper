Or I could write vanilla lesfic, lesbian fiction catering strictly to a lesbian audience. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut what about real, live women who existed in their own right? What about later-in-life women who discovered their sexuality after society told them they should be married with children? What about young women, finding their place in a society dominated by men?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about a young woman who thrives in her first year at college, only to lose her identity for the next ten years after being raped?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat about a young woman, just out of college, who struggles to choose between protecting her homophobic family and yielding to her live-in girlfriend\u0027s demand to come out?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMost of all, what about the women and girls who contemplate suicide rather than face a world in which they are condemned as sinful?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs this the world we want to live in?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI say no. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome people fight with legal action. The Supreme Court\u0027s decision to legalize same-sex marriage was a huge step toward equality. So is the fight for trans women and men to use the bathrooms matching their identities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOthers fight with scholarly articles, fundraising, shelters for LGBT teens, and public speaking.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMe, I\u0027m an author. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write of a world where a girl may love a girl, and the world stays intact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere a girl may love a girl and perhaps play with some kinky toys, and still their world remains standing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere a girl may love a girl, use kinky toys, and be welcomed by their chosen faith community.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere LGBT, kinky, and faith can stand united. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you believe in this world of love?
