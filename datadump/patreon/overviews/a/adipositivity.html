    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eCAN THE ADIPOSITIVITY PROJECT BE SAVED?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince 2007, it has been my abundant pleasure to preach\nbody autonomy and fat acceptance by photographing and purveying the bare badonks\nof unapologetic fat folks at \u003ca href=\"http://www.adipositivity.com\"\u003ewww.adipositivity.com\u003c/a\u003e and beyond. Many thanks for ten years of your love and\nparticipation. But I\u2019ve had to stop taking photographs for the Adipositivity\nProject. I\u2019ve not done an Adipositivity shoot since last year. The photos\nposted in recent months have come from the lengthy queue, which will soon be\nempty. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSomeone recently asked how the Adipositivity Project\nis funded. I told her Adiposers don\u2019t pay for their shoots, and prior to this\nyear, no one has been turned away, as long as they\u2019re fat and can get to me.\nAfter a bit of a silence, she said, \u201cI\u2019m both impressed\u2026 and mortified.\u201d That\npretty much sums up the funding situation. Calendar and print sales (and the\noccasional donation) help to cover some of the expenses, but the rest is paid\nfor by me, already a broke-ass creative. Except for a bit of lecturing, and maybe\nhalf a dozen images which have been licensed over the years, I\u2019m not paid for\nany Adipositivity work.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaintaining this level of\nunpaid work for more than a decade has caused me to neglect my personal\nfinancial survival. I\u2019d hoped to hang on one more year, but it doesn\u2019t appear\npossible.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo as things stand, I\u2019ll continue updating the\nwebsite every week until the queue runs out, then I\u2019ll keep the site up\nthrough April. There will be one last Dude Week, one last Valentine Series, and\nAdiposers who\u2019ve not yet seen their photo posted will see their photo posted. But no new Adipositivity shoots and I\u2019m not yet\ncertain about a final calendar.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m not complaining about my situation. Unless you\ncount the correspondence I get every day from fat folks laying bare their\nhearts, no one has twisted my arm. I didn\u2019t realize it would result in my not\nhaving time to earn a proper living on the side, but the decision to create the\nproject was mine, and every day upon waking, I\u2019ve made the choice to continue,\ndespite the negatives. That\u2019s how great the positives have been. My only regret\nis having to end the project while I still have so many shoots I\u2019ve been unable\nto do, and the number of requests to be Adiposers is greater than ever before.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eSo I\u2019ve asked the advice of some who are familiar\nwith the situation, and some fellow photographers working in other fields of\nactivism. They\u2019ve all pretty uniformly replied, \u201cDuh. Patreon!\u201d\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve therefore decided to *gulp* try one last thing to keep\nthe project from ending in April. I\u2019m not good at this, and I\u2019d rather end the\nproject than make it exclusive to those who can pay for it, so if I can\u2019t do it\nwithout constant nagging and firewalls keeping non-patrons from content, I\u2019ll\npull the plug. But I\u2019d hate to end things without giving supporters a chance to\nactually, y\u2019know, support.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can\u2019t spare a crispy or two a month, I\nunderstand. I believe others will take up the slack by donating a bit more, and\nI hope everyone\u2019ll help by sharing this link. Signal boosts are the only way\nthis is going to work. Ferocious signal boosts.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u2019s now up to you. Will it be Plan A for April or\nPlan B for bucks? Many thanks in advance. And fingers crossed.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Substantia Jones\u003cbr\u003eCreator and Photographer / The Adipositivity Project\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e"

I do this using\nvarious forms of purveyance, but primarily with photography, subverting this\ntool commonly used in promoting body shame, and using it instead to demystify\nthe fat body and give it the respect and visibility too often denied it by the\nmedia and popular culture.
