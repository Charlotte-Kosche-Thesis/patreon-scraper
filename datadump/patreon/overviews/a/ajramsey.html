    "summary": "Hello Everyone! \u003cbr\u003eWelcome to my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst I would like to give a little introduction of me, myself and I. \u003cbr\u003eMy name is Amanda. I have been drawing for years. I\u0027m mostly self taught and have taken some classes in school. Right now I am working on my first Bachelors degree in Animation. I\u0027m a newbie at it but I love it and I have so many ideas on stories I would love to animate for people. \u003cbr\u003eOther than that I love playing video games, reading comics, watching fun little shows and movies. I am always referencing stuff. haha\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason why I started a Patreon is because I need a new computer. I currently do not have a job(long long story) and my computer is on its dying leg. Poor machine can not even render a low poly space ship with four shader\u0027s in maya. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother reason...I want to start a webcomic. Like for reals a webcomic. I have two stories swimming in my head and when I get to the point of creating one, I want this to be a place where fans can see extra goodies of that story.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I think a main reason I am doing this is because I love drawing art for people and teaching people my techniques. I want to use this Patreon site for my patrons to be able to get art from me that may not be able to afford my commission prices. I want to show patrons how to draw, paint, create subject matters that they want to see. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHelp me achieve these goals! We will have lots of fun! \u003cbr\u003eNot to mention you get to see my silly animations as I learn. XD\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAll patrons get a portrait sketch after one month of joining!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
