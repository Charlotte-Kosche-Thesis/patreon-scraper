    "summary": "I created my youtube channel, Audible Quiet ASMR, to help people experience that pleasant tingly feeling that those in the ASMR community have come to know so well. Whether you listen to ASMR videos for relaxation, to go to sleep, or purely to evoke that ASMR tingle, I make videos for you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI try to upload at least 5 videos a week. Mondays and Fridays I upload Gaming Let\u0027s Plays, On Tuesdays I do \u0027No Talk Tuesday\u0027, Wednesdays I upload Vlogs, and Saturdays I usually have a Role Play for you. Thursdays and Sundays are random. I love a wide variety of ASMR genres and triggers, so I make eclectic videos!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always had trouble relaxing and sleeping, and finding the ASMR community has changed my life. I love knowing that I am making content that can help others experience ASMR - I can help other people with their relaxation and sleep. Running my ASMR channel has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. I love all of my subscribers whether they watch, they \u0027like\u0027, or they comment on my youtube videos and I want to thank them for helping change my life for the better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe reason for Audible Quiet ASMR is you, so I want the Patreon to be about you, too. It\u0027s such an honor knowing that there are people out there that love my content enough to want to donate. However, if I\u0027m going to accept donations from people, I want them to get something in return. I want to show my thanks and appreciation, and I feel like Patreon is the best way for me to give back to those that want to donate.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve set up several donation tiers with a wide variety of rewards and I look forward to connecting with my patrons and moving forward together with Audible Quiet ASMR. With your help, I can grow and expand my channel to produce higher quality content that you have a hand in creating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour patronage will help me to upgrade my ASMR studio equipment. Your donations will help me purchase things like a green screen set up, props for role plays, SD cards, a computer that renders a 30 minutes video faster than 5 hours, and eventually even a 3Dio Mic! I will always actively try to make the quality of my work better and better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSending my thanks to everyone who watches my videos~\u003cbr\u003eAudible Quiet\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS - All of my content will always be free (minus youtube ads)! You will never have to pay money in order to see my videos. I love and appreciate all of my subscribers whether you are able to or choose to donate or not. \u0026lt;3 \u0026lt;3"
