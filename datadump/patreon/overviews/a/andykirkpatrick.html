Read on:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI heard \u003cstrong\u003eTony Robbins\u003c/strong\u003e on the radio the other day, you know: the guy who looks like\u003cstrong\u003e Jaws\u003c/strong\u003e from the Bond films, the one who runs around a stage in front of loads of screaming people like God\u2019s henchmen, biting down with manly vigour on the everyday worries and insecurities of his audience.  What he does is take what people know about themselves, mixes it with some \u003cstrong\u003enew-age businessy power cheese\u003c/strong\u003e, then feeds it back to them at an exorbitant price (or indirectly via a \u2018using a certified Anthony Robbins life coach\u2019).   Anyway at the end of the ad for his a forthcoming \u2018\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ebelief touchdown\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019 (or something like that) in Dublin he called himself a \u2018\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ethought leader\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019. \u0027\u003cem\u003eWow the man balls\u003c/em\u003e\u0027 I thought, \u003cem\u003e\u2018I need to get on that racket\u003c/em\u003e\u2019, cash in on what I knew, fill some stadiums, sell some life coaching packages, maybe copyright my \u2018system for personal growth\u2019 I\u2019d developed, based around the worship of cakes of all kinds (excluding those with \u003cstrong\u003eraisins)\u003c/strong\u003e.  \u2018\u003cem\u003eI\u2019ll make a fortune\u003c/em\u003e\u2019 I thought.  Then I realised I couldn\u2019t be arsed - \u003cstrong\u003eit sounded like a full time job\u003c/strong\u003e. \u00a0I\u2019d rather just write and talk and think about things that don\u2019t make me money, things that pop into head: cake thoughts and the odd raisin idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.thelowry.com/Images/Brochure45/Andy_Kirkpatrick_main.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve been \u003cstrong\u003ewriting\u003c/strong\u003e pretty much non stop for about twenty years, and kind of make a living out of it - by which I mean I don\u2019t make any \u003cstrong\u003emoney\u003c/strong\u003e fromwriting, but get to call myself a writer when traveling through US customs (even though that living is supported by other things, speaking and the odd hit I do for the \u003cstrong\u003emob\u003c/strong\u003e).   I\u2019ve written quite a few books, books that won \u003cstrong\u003eawards\u003c/strong\u003e and appeared in funny languages I can\u0027t read (German, Italian, Polish and even \u003cstrong\u003eKorean\u003c/strong\u003e!).  I\u2019ve always fancied translating one of these books - translated by proper writers - back into English: how cool would that be?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI digress (\u003cstrong\u003eI get easily distracted\u003c/strong\u003e) over the last few years I took my inability to \u003cstrong\u003efilter\u003c/strong\u003e myself (I\u2019m told there is something wrong with how my brain fires - which is great) - which worked well on stage - and put it into my writing.  I began by being very \u003cstrong\u003ehonest\u003c/strong\u003e about what I thought, and tried to apply the same bravery I had for climbing mountains to this attempt to understand myself.  Yes it was all very 21st century, very\u003cstrong\u003e narcissistic\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003enavel gazing\u003c/strong\u003e, but it helped me get somewhere good in the end (I really believe in the \u003cstrong\u003epower of writing\u003c/strong\u003e a honest account of the story of \u0027us\u0027).  It was an adventure and I ended up turning over many of the truths of \u0027me\u0027 , of what I took at\u003cstrong\u003e sacred\u003c/strong\u003e and\u003cstrong\u003e unquestionable\u003c/strong\u003e: my politics, my past, my whole belief system ended up - instead of brain-fill - as  \u003cstrong\u003elandfill\u003c/strong\u003e.  What I learnt was that we are \u003cstrong\u003ewrapped up and entrapped by our stories\u003c/strong\u003e, and it is mostly fiction.  And now, in between writing about climbing and gear and techniques, I like to write about the exploration of this idea.  You could say I\u2019m looking for some \u003cstrong\u003etruth\u003c/strong\u003e while knowing as soon as I find it it\u2019ll be a lie, but that\u0027s pretty much what I\u0027ve done all my life as a climber.  Anyway the \u003cstrong\u003esummit\u003c/strong\u003e of the truth is not what it\u2019s all about.  If I can create a real \u003cstrong\u003equestion\u003c/strong\u003e in my own mind about something I thought I had all the answers for, and can share that through your writing, well that\u2019s the point.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://cdn.ukc2.com/i/243015.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd yet the beauty of the \u003cstrong\u003eblog\u003c/strong\u003e, with its freedom for that\u003cstrong\u003e little oppression of the conformity of ideas\u003c/strong\u003e (I have no editor and no boss to fear, no advertisers to keep sweet) also means it is a real sacrifice to write what I write, as it takes time.  What writing I do is paid for by the work I do as a speaker (not by writing), it\u0027s that that sustains my books and blogs (US customs think I\u2019m taking the piss when asked what I do for a living I answer: \u2018\u003cstrong\u003eSpeaking\u003c/strong\u003e\u2019). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LR8-wqtXWNU/hqdefault.jpg\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I hate is when I do have an idea for a piece of writing, one that may take two or three days (I can write but I\u0027m not a natural writer... \u003cstrong\u003eI type with one finger still\u003c/strong\u003e), but it has to be set aside while paid work is done.  Set aside work usually stays that way.

     "about": "The US magazine\u003cstrong\u003e Climbing\u003c/strong\u003e once described Andy as a climber with a \u003cem\u003e\u201cstrange penchant for the long, the cold and the difficult\u201d\u003c/em\u003e, with a reputation\u003cem\u003e \u201cfor seeking out routes where the danger is real, and the return is questionable, pushing himself on some of the hardest walls and faces in the Alps and beyond, sometimes with partners and sometimes alone.\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMore succinctly, Metro magazine claims that he \u201cmakes Ray Mears look like Paris Hilton\u201d.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndy\u0027s speciality is big wall climbing and winter expeditions, which involves pitting himself against a vertical climbs of over 1000 metres (that\u2019s two and a half world trade centres), often in temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees. Andy has scaled Yosemite\u0027s El Capitan - one of the hardest walls in America - over twenty four times, including three solo ascents and a one day ascent (18h), as well as climbing it with a paraplegic climber, his thirteen year old daughter and a blind friend. One of these ascents was a 12 day solo of the Reticent Wall, viewed at the time as perhaps the hardest climb of its type in the world, and the subject of his award winning book Psychovertical.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2002 he undertook one of the hardest climbs in Europe: a 15 day winter ascent of the West face of the Dru. This 1000 metre pillar pushed him and his partner to their limits and was featured in the award winning film \u0027Cold Haul\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn 2014 Andy made the first ascent of the South Ridge of Ulvertanna, Antarctica, viewed by climbers as the \u0027hardest mountain in the world\u0027 - spending 14 days at minus thirty and colder to reach the top. One month later, battling frostbitten toes, Andy lead the TV presenter Alex Jones up Moonlight Buttress in Zion for Sports Relief, raising \u00a32 million pounds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndy has also taken part in many expeditions, including four winter expeditions to Patagonia, a crossing of Greenland, first ascents in Antarctica, and to many nights spent suffering to mention. The stories that Andy has brought back from these expeditions have become modern classics in the climbing world and have brought new meaning to the words \u0027epic\u0027 and \u0027cold\u0027...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is perhaps Andy\u0027s journey from remedial student to successful climber, writer and speaker that interests his audience most. Brought up on a council estate in one of Britain\u0027s flattest cities, Hull-born Andy suffered from severe dyslexia which went undiagnosed until he was 19. One of his greatest strengths is his ability to talk about his life and his climbs in a way that is totally accessible to the non-climber and allows the audience to experience the risk and tension of big wall climbing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAndy also works in film and TV, as a stunt safety advisor and this plays a part in many of his talks, which take you from the heights of Patagonia to the chocolaty depths of Charlie and the Chocolate factory!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
