    "summary": "I paint as often as I am inspired by the world, which is frequent. I see beautiful people and I want to draw their faces. I see patterns swirling around and I want to include them in my designs. I read dark stories and I want to express them in vivid color. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love it when I post a picture of something I spent hours, sometimes days, mapping out with paint and I receive oohs and awws. That is my lifeblood! I feel like I have to give back more, and more, and more. This means more paintings, more drawings, more pigment, more paper, and more brushes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt gets expensive.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could - and do - sell paintings and prints online at \u003ca href=\"http://www.angellaveaux.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003emy web site\u003c/a\u003e as well as on \u003ca href=\"https://www.etsy.com/shop/AngelsDevils\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEtsy\u003c/a\u003e and various art shows around town, but the money\u0027s not consistent and it\u0027s hardly enough to cycle into bigger projects. That does not stop me from creating, or sharing. It just limits me. Even if I could charge to show people my work, I wouldn\u0027t, because I just love doing it that much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I\u0027m asking for is help. I need help to make more. I need more to explore the world through my art. My ultimate goal, MY DREAM, is to someday make art for a living. Nothing would make me happier than to show my gratitude by giving back. I\u0027d love to send you something beautiful, something to cherish, something to keep.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease check out my rewards.

I enjoy working with many \ndifferent types of media, including pen and pencil (colored and \ngraphite), paint (oil, acrylic and watercolor), as well as markers and \nacrylic inks. Paper crafting is another passion of mine. I get bored easily, so I shift around various subject \nmatter, although I tend to gravitate toward the macabre and the \nburlesque. I also like drawing and painting storms, particularly \ntornadoes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
