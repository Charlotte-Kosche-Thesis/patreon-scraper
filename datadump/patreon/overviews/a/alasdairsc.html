    "summary": "Hello there, greetings, etc\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Alasdair and I\u0027m trying to become a full-time streamer. I started in April 2016 and through a lot of work, a lot of help, and a LOT of luck have managed to grow my stream to a reasonable size. I\u0027d like to keep growing it, and have all sorts of goals and ideas for 2017. Those of you that know me know that I don\u0027t like asking for money, hell - I don\u0027t even like viewing this as a business, super-serious and whatnot, simply because we\u0027re playing games and hanging out and making things funny. However, for every content creator, this IS a business, and thus involves finances.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was advised to set up a Patreon page for people to have the option to support me with more than a Twitch subscription, but more consistently than donations. $500 per month, combined with my income from Twitch, would pretty much be enough for me to live off as a \u0027full-time\u0027 streamer. Anything beyond that would be amazing and help significantly improve my quality of life and also purchase things to help improve the stream, whether it be buying games, streaming equipment, PC upgrades, less terrible cooking equipment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is my hope that this is not seen as greedy, but some people have expressed a wish to support with more than a Twitch sub and perhaps do not want the kerfuffle or publicity of donating every now and then, or want it to be more reliable from my POV.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of my goals for this year as a streamer are to grow my Youtube channel, which is relatively small compared to my Twitch channel. I\u0027d like to put out one video a week to show people who can\u0027t always catch my stream live some of the funny moments, as well as being generally quite good videos to give new potential viewers an indication of what kind of content they can expect from my livestream. I\u0027d like our Discord community to grow as it\u0027s very friendly and welcoming and a great place to interact with other viewers and organise community events!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs my viewer base increases, the sub count on Twitch should too, and that\u0027s by far the most reliable source of income - donations are absolutely great, don\u0027t get me wrong, but they\u0027re inconsistent. However, some people have expressed a desire to pay more than a Twitch sub per month, which is where Patreon comes in. To anybody reading this who decides they\u0027d like to do that, I am so very grateful to you and it\u0027s all one step closer to doing this as a full-time thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have plans for a charity event hopefully in the next couple of months, along with various collaborations with other streamers."
