    "summary": "Apartment\nEarth is a contemporary fine art gallery based in Charleston, West Virginia.\nThe gallery space has a unique presence in the state where arts institutions\nare largely devoted to showing traditional arts and crafts or well-established\nartists. Apartment Earth shows the type of artwork that you don\u2019t expect to see\nin West Virginia - and rarely find in other galleries based in Charleston. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\ngallery is devoted to presenting exemplary works primarily from emerging and\nundiscovered artists. The works are daring, provocative \u2013 and sometimes even\ncontroversial. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe\nspace is a vibrant contributor to Charleston\u2019s community and is often one of\nthe most popular stops during monthly arts events. Beyond providing a source of\nentertainment and value to residents of Charleston, the unique nature of the\ngallery means that it is one of few venues available for the diverse population\nof emerging, contemporary West Virginian artists to exhibit their work. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy\nWe Need Your Help\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBecause\nof the type of artwork that Apartment Earth presents, including works from artists\nthat aren\u2019t able to command high price points and\nexperientially-focused/installation works that are inherently challenging to\nsell, we are requesting your help with a monthly sustainer gift as a measure to help offset the costs to run the gallery space so that we may\ncontinue to operate in Charleston. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\nWe Need\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nare looking for monthly sustainer gifts at the $1 to $10 levels to help offset\noperational expenses such as utilities, which average in excess of $250 each\nmonth, and human resources support to keep the gallery open for regular\nbusiness hours throughout the month.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis\nis a stopgap solution while we seek to diversify our revenue streams,\nincluding:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOffer regular workshops and classes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBuilding a better online presence to sell and promote\n     our work.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDiversifying the types of artwork and merchandise we\n     sell.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eimplement methods to cut our overhead costs, such as installing LED lighting.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWe\nare working diligently every day to see that we are able to get to a\nself-sustaining point in the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGOAL SECTION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur primary goal is to obtain a baseline level of $500 per month in sustaining gifts as a measure to meet our operational needs (described in the \u201cWhat We Need\u201d\nsection on this page) and keep the gallery running in Charleston. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf\n23% of our Facebook followers give $1 per month or less than 5% of our followers give\n$5 per month \u2013 we have achieved this goal.

He has exhibited at numerous galleries and museums around the state and is currently an adjunct professor at West Virginia State University. The juxtaposition of being raised in a family with multiple generations employed by the local power plants and spending childhood summers in the wilderness of Pocahontas County is the shaping factor behind all his work. His goal is to create non-hypocritical place for people on both sides of the environmental argument to come together.",

Full spectrum LED lights provide a much more pleasant viewing experience for the art on display. They put off less heat and are extremely more efficient than incandescent lighting and would therefore reduce electricity costs.",

The gallery doesn\u0027t make enough money to support itself and in the past I have been able to cover the losses from my own pocket. Due to several factors including ongoing medical expenses for my dog Schwitters, among other things, I no longer have that ability. I know this is a big thing to ask, but if you enjoy the programming that you get to see in the gallery then please consider giving a small amount to this campaign. By supporting the gallery in this way, you are also providing a venue for artists to exhibit their work who may not get the chance otherwise.",

We absolutely love showing controversial work as well as outside of the box installation art that has no hope of selling. With the cost of keeping the space open, this is currently impossible for us to do. Finding alternative funding for rent, utilities and staff is very important to us and this campaign is a great way for you to help us achieve that goal.",

Once the campaign has reached the $300 level it will give us the ability to resume the workshops in earnest.
