Bubbles had burst and Bitcoin was a thing, but the net had staying power. Many would celebrate its continued growth. Many would feel it heralded the decline of civilized society. There was indeed a Venn Diagram and the overlap probably wouldn\u0027t surprise you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen 2016 arrived, nobody seemed any more confident there could be a consensus of which group was closer to the truth. For every fundraiser helping a family in need, there was a family having SWAT called to their house under false pretenses. For every teenager finding a support network to cope with a bad environment, there was a teenager harassed for being different from their peers. For every positive message received from a stranger, there was an obscene photo meant to intimidate someone into silence.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMadness; that\u0027s all that has been sufficient to describe this era of the internet.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWho We Are:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmala Network is currently a one-person operation run by Colby Klaus.

We write examinations of video games that go deeper than simple mechanics to give stories and themes their proper shake. Politics are discussed with the truth in mind that not every story has two sides--especially when lives are at stake. Analysis and explanation of events in the world of social media are undertaken with the mission to confront the imbalances of power which often result in minority voices being silenced.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhy We Care:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAmala Network aims to share the stories of the invisible, the downtrodden, the oft-forgotten; these are not the voiceless, but rather the voices drowned out by negativity and fear. We strive to re-focus conversation on topics to the people at the core of the choices we make as a result of these discussions. Punditry and outrage always include a human cost that many of us have been expended to satisfy. We can make sure the voices affected are always at the forefront of conversation, reducing unnecessary suffering from our words to our actions.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eContact Us:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003eColby Klaus can currently be reached\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/_lifestyled\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ethrough Twitter\u003c/a\u003e, on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://Facebook.com/amalanetwork\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"mailto:colby.klaus@me.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003evia email.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
