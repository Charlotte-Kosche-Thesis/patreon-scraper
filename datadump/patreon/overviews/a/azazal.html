If it wasn\u0027t for that help, I would not be able to produce right now. I am very lucky to have such good fans and friends online and really there is no way to thank you enough for that. I wish I was more present during 2017 because I owe it to you all. After losing everything I was very down and that made it hard to work efficiently and communicate with people, but I\u0027m going to fix that. Despite being quiet, I have been working hard learning a lot more about production and made a lot of new music which is now all coming together.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.prntscr.com/image/-PzrfKq6T5GvxYojwYtG5w.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://image.prntscr.com/image/6Y1LqiShQS_Qvr60N7DGig.png\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eI make music because I love the creativity, and I love being able to have a positive impact on people by making things for everyone to enjoy. Even though my work has only been public since 2016, I have dedicated my entire life since age 13 to practicing and studying music production, and since my very first release, I have made sure there has been a free download option for my music, because my main goal is for everyone to be able to enjoy it. I remember barely ever being able to buy my favourite music growing up and I don\u0027t want to inflict that on anyone who can\u0027t buy my music, so purely selling it is a last resort I hope Patreon will let me avoid.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I\u0027m Making a Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m making a Patreon because I\u0027m under a lot of pressure right now to give up music and work a normal job. Of course this would be a lot easier and simpler but I\u0027m never going to give up on music production. Since I turned 19 I soon have to either start paying rent or move out soon, and this is on top of paying the expenses I already pay to make music for you all. I\u0027ve invested almost all of my personal money since I was 13 into this, and I don\u0027t plan on changing that because it\u0027s my passion. But being 19 I have bigger expenses coming in that will prohibit me from producing if I\u0027m not careful, as I\u0027m completely on my own - I have no manager or label and do everything myself, and it\u0027s become clear I have zero support from anyone in my real life. I\u0027ve also made many \u003cem\u003emany\u003c/em\u003e sacrifices so far in my personal life to practice music production and make music for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn a lighter note, I think both Patreon and Discord will also serve as a more consistent way to communicate with everyone. I no longer use Facebook that often because I simply can\u0027t keep up with it anymore, and that leaves a hole in communication since that\u0027s where I would talk with listeners. The patron feed and Discord are far more organized and easier to keep up with.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTL;DR:\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027d \u003cem\u003elove\u003c/em\u003e to be able to keep including a free download option for all my music, as well as start to finish tracks consistently with many releases all throughout the year. Absolutely all of the support will go to production costs and to 100% necessary living expenses. I do not take this for-granted. Thank you so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd here\u0027s a quick look at the serum skin reward:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://image.prntscr.com/image/RO2pGqQjQUyhsiSF6-ZVgw.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
