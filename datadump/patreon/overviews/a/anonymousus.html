Thank you for your continued support allowing me to build an online home where the lived realities of third party reproduction can be shared and reflected upon. The idea that \"anonymity in donor-conception hides the truth, but anonymity in story-telling can help reveal it\" hit a chord with the public\u2014and the website has received incredible attention and web traffic despite the minuscule labor I have been able to invest in it. Thank you for reading the stories. Thank you for buying the books. Thank you for sharing the stories of these hundreds of anonymous authors with people in your life that are considering using sperm/egg donors or surrogates. It truly helps others make more informed decisions in how they build their families and manage their desire for human connection."

     "about": "The Anonymous Us Project is an online story-collective for donor-conceived people, parents and donors, and anyone whose life has been affected by third party reproduction. It was founded in 2011 by Alana Newman\u2014who is both donor-conceived and a former egg donor.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eNewman had the insight while she was writing critically of third party reproduction practices that the offspring and users of these services have social disincentives to speak honestly about all the negative aspects. They may be afraid to hurt their loved ones. So all the stories are submitted anonymously because while \"anonymity in donor-conception hides the truth, anonymity in story-telling can help reveal it.\"\u003cbr\u003eHundreds of stories have been submitted since its debut. Two books have been published featuring the best of the submissions. If you have a story you would like published simply go to www.AnonymousUs.org click on the \"submit your story\" button and share your first person testimonial.",
