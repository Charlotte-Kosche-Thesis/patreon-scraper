    "summary": "Well, I\u0027ve got the comic\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.abbyandnorma.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\"Abby and Norma\u003c/a\u003e,\" currently on hiatus.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s about an autistic college student, a good friend, a pet starling, two precocious little cousins, an uber-geek whose parents bred him in the hopes that his antisocial genes would save the world, and a modern artist Trekkie who speaks only in palindromes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIt has puns, nerdy pop culture, and analysis of illogical human customs from an outsider\u0027s perspective. (I\u0027m on the autism spectrum myself, so I sometimes take a lot of pleasure in poking fun at the counterintuitive twists of social life.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nThe comic used to update twice a week, on Saturday and Sunday. The art was mostly copied and pasted. It had a bit of a fan base, but it wasn\u0027t as great a comic as it could be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt kept going that way for about 10 years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, recently, after a few months of high-stress life, I\u0027ve taken a break to reevaluate how I\u0027m going about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSee, I work full time in a pharmacy to support myself and my husband John, who\u0027s trying to live as a freelance writer. I also have side jobs, like public speaking, writing books, making jewelry, and drawing on commission... yes, I CAN draw, I just don\u0027t have time to do it every week for the comic. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI get paid for those things. I put less work into \"Abby and Norma,\" by necessity, because it doesn\u0027t pay.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhich is part of why I\u0027ve stopped updating. But I\u0027m working on starting up again, and I can always use the help of patrons!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith more patrons, I could spend less time on stuff I do to make money, and more time on \"Abby and Norma.\" I could buy things to help make the strip better, like digital drawing programs and maybe even a new computer someday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI could increase the number of strips per week. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI could post more actual hand-drawn artwork.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI could put more time into the characters, making some of the simpler ones more complex and realistic instead of the two-dimensional straw men they often seem to be, and perhaps adding more characters and a wider range of diversity.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI could design better T-shirts, print collections and other merchandise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI might even be able to travel to a comic con outside my home state, once in a while.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSo, if that interests you, please support me and \"Abby and Norma\"!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
