This is a wonderful method to help support art and artists, and to be able to have your hand in the Arts Communities, and the creation of new art! The subscriptions I receive through Patreon help keep me creating new and challenging artwork by helping support the purchase of art supplies, studio space, and vendor fees (once I start being able to go to shows). I am deeply appreciative of those who support the arts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have always loved art, music, and writing. It has been integral to who I am as person for as long as I can remember. I didn\u0027t start painting until after my deployment in the military, and I used it as an escape; a method to deal with the difficulties of being deployed on a navy ship during conflict.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years, my ability to produce art came and went, depending on the time I had between working two jobs and raising children. With encouragement from many of my friends, and my family, I finally have been able to make my dedication to painting my full time focus.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI work in acrylic and mixed media on wood panels. I have recently started experimenting with water colors as well, though it will be some time before those become available.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy the art you find among the pages of Patreon, and become a Patron to not just myself, but many other amazing and talented artists.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Beth Moore, a self-taught artist, began exploring her creative side as therapy for PTSD associated with Military Service. A Disabled Veteran, she works from home, with her studio assistants, a boxer named Sparky, and a calico cat named Dot. In 2010 she took the plunge and began to sell her abstract pieces - first privately to family and friends, and later setting up shop on etsy where her pieces are quickly snapped up. This year she has taken a further step by starting a Patreon page, as well as attending conventions as a vendor. Her influences include Claude Monet, Jean-Paule Riopelle, Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Courtney Bailey (www.twistofunique.com), Sarah Wade (Sarah Wade Art), and many others. Her favorite part of the creative process is the focus and feel of creating something new and beautiful. Her work reflects a body working elements into a form that heals the mind for a renewed spirit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecome a Patron: \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/artbybeecreations\"\u003ehttps://www.patreon.com/artbybeecreations\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Patrons:\u003cbr\u003eGretchen Goodrich - Tampa, Florida\u003cbr\u003eSarah Gullet - Atlanta GA\u003cbr\u003eI also write! \u003ca href=\"https://themighty.com/author/beth-moore/\"\u003ehttps://themighty.com/author/beth-moore/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
