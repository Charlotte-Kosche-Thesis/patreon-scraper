    "summary": "HI. Hola. Salud!\u003cbr\u003eThanks for stopping by!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eA few friends suggested I do this, so here I am. So...I\u0027m a model, writer, pro wrestler and full-time student at Full Sail University earning my degree in Creative Writing for Entertainment. I\u0027ve been writing since I could hold a pencil, but modeling and pro wrestling paid the bills better. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou\u0027ll see a LOT of the cosplay, wrestling, comic book and fitness stuff here. A LOT.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*PLEASE NOTE:\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eRewards are sent out the 3rd/4th of each month.\u003c/strong\u003e If you don\u0027t receive them, something went wrong with your billing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e*ALSO: If you pledge and do not follow through, you will be reported, be posted on the Patreon watch list, and blocked.* That is not cool. Not cool at all. Don\u0027t lie and steal.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are real people, who work hard, go to school and do the best we can. \u003cbr\u003eCreating and writing takes time away from things that pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m very grateful for Patronage because it truly helps. \u003cbr\u003ePlease treat us as you\u0027d like to be treated and respect that this is our work. \u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat said, one day I woke up one day and decided to chase the REAL dream. I enrolled back in school and started to write as a way of life instead just randomly when the inspiration hit. I struggle with fiction but love essay writing. However, I get lucky with publishing fiction more often. I have another blog at\u003ca href=\"http://aprilhunterblog.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e AprilHunterBlog.com\u003c/a\u003e where you can read more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdditionally, I paint, make soy candles (\u003ca href=\"http://www.etsy.com/shop/aprilsscentsations\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAprilsScentSations\u003c/a\u003e on Etsy \u0026amp; FB) dabble in photography and I\u0027m a professional cosplayer, fitness, comic book and pinup model.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think creativity feeds creativity,\u00a0 so as long as you are creating, you keep finding inspiration, even if it\u0027s not your main field.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope having this page will push me to finish projects, since \"sharing is caring\" and NOT being a starving student/artist would be really nice!\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to use this as constant content creation motivation. (Say that fast. Go on...I\u0027ll wait.) I need that proverbial \"gun to my head\", so maybe YOU and this page will help provide it. :)\u003cbr\u003e"
