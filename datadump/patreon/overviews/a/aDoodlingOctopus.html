    "summary": "I have to put words here? Well here are some words about things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJust an Octopus living in a Non-Octopus world trying to make a living off of art. I\u0027d like to say all of the money would go towards studio arty things, MOST of the money will go to that, some will go to bills to keep my studio up and running, some will go to treats for Meep, my very involved kittums, and some will go to the fish (Wouldn\u0027t be a Housequarium without them!). So really you\u0027re supporting every aspect of my artistic life and I am eternally grateful to you for that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSome projects I have in the works that you will be funding\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1st off I\u0027m announcing my official start of my very first \u003cem\u003eChildren\u0027s Book starring Montipus the Octopus Traveller!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003eI\u0027ll be updating this area as time goes on as I work out more of the details. So far a list of the characters that will be making cameos in the first few books are: The Octopus Traveler Montipus,\u00a0Space cow Creamery, Sir Hamster The Adventurer, Miko the goldfish, and a Cosmic Goddess as the Guide/Sage.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe book is in the very early concept stages, but here\u0027s where \u003cem\u003eYOU\u003c/em\u003e come in! You get to fund the process AND watch it grow into the story I know it can be some day soon! I will be posting character designs and sketches, environment thoughts, color pallets, really anything that I can show you in the brainstorming process! The art style will be in traditional art, so for every $5 you give me is a tube of paint, a new marker or colored pencil, or treats for Meep. All very important things that I need to keep this dream moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am in the works of planning a Kickstarter for a plush line with some of these characters from my upcoming book. You will be notified among the 1st when that site gets launched, the 1st plush will be Montipus, then next will be Mr. Moonstachio, and third possibly a viewer vote!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your time and I hope you enjoy my work."
