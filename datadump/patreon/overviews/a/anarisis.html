I am a graphic designer, game designer, dungeon master, and fantasy cartographer! Meaning I make art and content around Tabletop Roleplaying Games. I\u0027m running two actual play live RPG shows a week on twitch, I produce maps and token borders for the Roll20 Virtual Tabletop, and I make homebrew rules and full-blown game systems that explore new ways to play.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n Best of all, I make all of that content available to you for cheap or free.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat makes you different?\u003c/h2\u003eI believe that RPGs have the power to change lives for the better, and I am committed to elevating the hobby. I do meaningful work within the RPG space, from running socially-conscious RPG shows that illustrate contemporary concerns to designing games that explore what it means to form an identity or to define our relationships. Regardless of what I work on, I always put in the extra work to make unique content that meet my own high standards of quality and meaning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h2\u003e\nI believe in Patreon\u0027s ability to distribute resources within a community. I love that Patreon creates a community where members of even small means can support the creation of content that adds value to that\u00a0community. I prefer this to putting my work behind paywalls, because I know the struggle of being a member of the hobby with no money to spare, and I want to be able to make content for our whole community of nerds. I want to make works that people can enjoy regardless of their financial situation \u2014 but to do that I need those of you with  some dollars to spare to support that creative work. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt\u0027s true: What I do is time-consuming and requires expensive tools. Through this patreon, you are not only supporting my ability to do this work but also supporting the creation of quality content in the public domain.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat content am I supporting?\u003c/h2\u003e\nBy donating, you will help me run two weekly RPG shows, design a tabletop roleplaying game, and create one set of assets for Roll20 each month.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dylangrinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Content-header_Layer-Comp-4.png\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy second RPG show is a gritty high-fantasy trek through the steamy jungles of the Forgotten Realms\u0027 Chult. Run with the Adventurer\u0027s League rules and featuring the Tomb of Annihilation module, The League: ToA brings together creators from around the hobby to play in the most quintessential D\u0026amp;D campaign I can muster. Joining me are cast members Sir Lucien, Gnomedic, and PbPlaysInside.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dylangrinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Content-header-Fun-Shots.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFun-Shots is a series of 1\u20134 session games run in a wide variety of systems and cast members.

Becoming is a game in which players take control of self-aware Artificial Intelligence within a simulated world. The only self-aware programs within the shining streets of The Network, the players define their characters and develop identities over the course of a campaign by growing incrementally after defeat. Narratively, Becoming examines identity, purpose, and morality through the ever-shifting lens of burgeoning sentience. Mechanically, Becoming seeks to shake up the stale turn-based nature of classic RPG combat and provide meaningful systems for deciding actions outside of violent conflict \u2014 giving everyone at the table the freedom to pursue the kinds of stories and interactions they want rather than being funneled into the murder-as-progression model so frequently presented in RPGs.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://dylangrinder.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Content-header_Layer-Comp-1.png\"\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy maps and token borders aim for realism and detail with satellite-style maps and token borders that mimic real-world materials. The ultimate goal for my maps and borders is always to make it easy to add production value to any campaign, improving the experience for visually-minded players while simultaneously reducing the effort the GM has to put in. Maps are specifically engineered to fit a wide variety of both classic and niche settings, and borders are designed with customization in mind to help GMs and players visually express their characters\u0027 identities.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI\u0027m dedicated to doing my part to make our little corner of the internet as great as it can be, and I recognize the responsibility that comes with accepting support from others.
