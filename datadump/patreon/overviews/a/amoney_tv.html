    "summary": "I have had several requests to train players 1 on 1 while streaming. Here I have finally gave in figured why not split the time between streaming full time and educating players. As a professional Rocket League player I feel I have a lot to offer to the players of this community. I will teach for an hour at a time, showing players from any skill level how to improve their game. We will do this in discord together, talking to each other the entire time. We will first go over 3 replays: One from 1v1, 2v2, and 3v3. If you choose to only want to do 2 of the 3, that\u0027s cool. I can show you everything you may need to work on to improve the fastest. For the last 20-30 mins of the hour, I can take you into a private match to 1v1, queue with you in regular 2v2s, or even can grab a friend and queue 3s. I will be analyzing your play style thouroughly and give you tips to greatly accelerate your learning journey in Rocket League. Also, I can watch your steam broadcast (if on steam) while you train to give key tips for getting to that desired rank you always wanted. If you have any questions just ask me on twitter at twitter.com/amoney_tv or send me a private message on twitch. I have trained many people in the past who have seen great results...it might not hurt to try ;)"

I will be able to decipher basic inconsistencies in your gameplay in that time, and can analyze and give helpful pointers to improve quickly. We will go through these replays live, on discord together, this way I could walk you through several positioning and mechanical flaws in your game and show you ways to fix them. For the next 20-30 minutes, we can either hop in a private 1v1, queue in 2v2, or grab a friend for 3v3 and I will try to help apply the concepts I taught you before...and also have fun stomping out our opponents ;) .",
