I actually started this channel with the aim of making the focus, miniature painting, but felt that I could use it to cover our whole hobby instead!\u003cbr\u003eBy the time we reach this goal, I may have already tried to film some miniature painting videos, but once we reach $50, I feel like a great way to improve the channel would be to build a specialist rig to film from a bird\u0027s eye view and really capture all of the details that go into miniature painting.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll hopefully film myself making the rig and pop it up here on Patreon so that you can get a behind the scenes look at the process!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for your support!\u003cbr\u003e",
