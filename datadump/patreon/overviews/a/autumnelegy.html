I hope to be able to get an apartment just off of my college campus once the school permits it, and before then this money will go towards my school housing fees. Having my own place would allow me to face less interruptions and background noise during streams and videos and would allow me to record audio more often since I currently can only at certain times of day when there isn\u0027t outside noise and my roommate isn\u0027t in the room.",
