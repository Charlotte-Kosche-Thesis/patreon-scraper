    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eWELCOME TO PATREON!\u003c/strong\u003e The video above describes why this page exists. The sidebar on the right shows what awesome perks you can get for contributing and helping me make videos, including special access, Patreon-only custom patches, and a LIVE Q\u0026amp;A. Also, other stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFor over 5 years now, I\u2019ve worked hard on creating video content for you guys and gals; the fans and viewers. We all have enjoyed the growth in this community that we have started and I want to do more for it. With a growing Patreon we can begin to dedicate more time into the content we create and add more shows to the channel for you.\u003cbr\u003eThank you for the support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY ARE YOU DOING A PATREON?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a while now, my more ambitious/creative style of airsoft videos have taken a backseat on the channel in favor of review and Q\u0026amp;A videos due to the time and resources that they require. So for a long time I\u2019ve thought \u201cWhat could I do to help add some creative spark to the channel?\u201d This led me to Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon and your support, it opens up so many more possibilities for my filmmaking. I\u2019ll be able to create more ambitious videos, more frequently.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT WILL YOU DO WITH MY MONEY?!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pride myself on being able to make money go a long way, I have a lot of experience of working with small budgets and adapting to creating the best videos I can.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eHere are a few things the money would be used for; materials, editing, cast, locations, music to name a few. All these things will bolster the work we do here to the next level while keeping the theme of Airsoftology that I have grown over the many years; helping the airsoft players and community grow through videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eFortunately, I\u2019ve been building a bank of equipment over the years and would rarely, \u003cstrong\u003eif ever\u003c/strong\u003e, need to use this money for equipment. This is going to be incredibly beneficial because equipment can be expensive to rent, and even more expensive to buy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI also \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003edo not\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e need to use this money to pay myself a salary, just to be clear. So know that every bit of your support here will go into growing and building new content on Airsoftology for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IF I DON\u2019T WANT TO DONATE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you don\u2019t want to donate, or you can\u2019t donate... don\u0027t worry! \u00a0That\u2019s totally cool. I don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to, this is completely optional. Please only donate if you \u003cstrong\u003ecan\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003ewant to\u003c/strong\u003e directly contribute towards Airsoftology videos being made.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you want to support me but don\u2019t want to become a Patron; you could check out my online store, or just continue to watch my videos like normal.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eEverything you do supports the channel, and you all matter, no matter how you do it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT IS YOUR GENERAL PLAN?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the immediate short term, I\u2019m going to get back into telling cool and ambitious stories through gameplay as frequently as I can while still producing my review and Q\u0026amp;A content so you get a mix of everything!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn the long term, I have so many things I want to make; Detailed tech how-to\u2019s, prototype reviews from inside the airsoft factories, how it\u2019s made videos\u2026 and so many other cool projects. Creating them independently with this Patreon will allow me to continue to post them on the Airsoftology channel to be watched and enjoyed by all - for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFINAL THOUGHTS\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m incredibly excited to be embarking on this next journey of creating and thrilled that if you\u2019re reading this, you\u2019re thinking about coming on this journey along with me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIn whatever capacity you\u2019re able to support me, I want to say thank you; Donating to the Patreon, buying merchandise, or just watching and following what I do - together we are keeping the hobby and sport of Airsoftology alive, and that makes me incredibly happy.\u003cbr\u003e"
