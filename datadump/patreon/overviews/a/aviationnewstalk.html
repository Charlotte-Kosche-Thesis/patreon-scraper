But it takes me a solid day each week to create the regular weekly show and much more for highly produced bonus shows. For example, the Privatization episode required over 40 hours of work! I hope you\u0027re finding the shows valuable! If you do, Please support me, so I can continue to produce the show for you each week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy I do the Show.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\ncreated Aviation News Talk because, while I love being a cohost on the Airplane\nGeeks podcast, there isn\u0027t enough time available on that show for me to share\nall the information I\u2019d like with listeners. And, as I listened to other\naviation podcasts, I wasn\u0027t finding the kind of general aviation show I was\nlooking for. I teach flying 5-6 days a week! And often after a flight, I think, \u201cI need to share this information with other pilots to help keep them\nsafe.\u201d That\u0027s why I started the show...to provide valuable information that\nmight help save a life (and I\u0027ve already been told by one pilot that something\nI told her saved her life!). \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat You Get on the Show. \u003c/strong\u003eA no-nonsense, to-the-point show focused strictly on General Aviation. I don\u0027t talk about airline and military aviation stories, unless there\u0027s a point to be made related to general aviation or flying safety. You can get aviation news on lots of web sites. But I give you a \u003cstrong\u003eperspective\u003c/strong\u003e on the news that comes from over forty years as a pilot. In addition to news, on each show I talk in depth about a pilot skill or safety issue. And I spend a lot of time researching information, so you can rely on what I tell you. Listeners have given me tons of feedback, and they say they find the show interesting, informative, and chock-full of relevant content and commentary. They like that the show is to the point and doesn\u0027t waste their time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePlease Support My Work!\u003c/strong\u003e Thanks for being part of an aviation community interested in continual learning to maximize safety. Producing a podcast is far more work than I imagined, which is probably why so many podcasters eventually drop out. Early on, I said I wouldn\u0027t take advertising for the show, though some listeners have encourage me to do so. Instead, \u003cstrong\u003ePlease support the show in any way you can!\u003c/strong\u003e Please donate at any level you can. Thank you and keep the Blue Side Up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYour Host\u003c/strong\u003e. Max\nTrescott is the 2008 National Certificated Flight Instructor of the Year.
