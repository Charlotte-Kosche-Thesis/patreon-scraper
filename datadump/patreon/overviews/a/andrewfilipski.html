    "summary": "Yeah that was a Pokemon rock cover...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello internet and welcome to my Patreon page! *\u003cem\u003edrum roll\u003c/em\u003e*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI am Andrew Filipski (no cool youtube name, I know, I am sorry) and I create guitar related video game covers along with posting original content from time to time\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/andrewfilipskimusic\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e. I started playing guitar in the 8th grade where I switched from my lovely clarinet to this interesting instrument that had 6 strings and no reeds. I grew up on music from bands you might have heard like Van Halen, ACDC, Blink 182, Sum 41, Scorpions, Green Day and playing games like Final Fantasy, Zelda, etc. To make this long story short, I\u0027ve begun to combine my passion for guitar playing with video games and now you have this patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy do I create videos and covers?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eOne of the biggest reasons why I create covers and arrangements is to learn the music theory behind certain songs. With years of guitar playing, but no formal theory training, creating covers has taught me there is much more to music. So now that when I play in bands or work on my solo album *hint hint* my ear has started to hear certain things that I never did before. Each cover I create, I create for the knowledge of \"How did that transition work? How does the melody over those chords work\".\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI then create videos simply because I enjoy it! It is always stunning to look back on past videos and say \"Yeah Drew, you looked silly then\", but have learned so much.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy would you want to contribute?\u003cbr\u003eFirst\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0contributing is totally optional, what you pay, and how often is up to you. I hope that my work will speak for me, and while money is always hard to come by, I will keep creating videos for the music knowledge. I put on average 20-40 hours per cover including music analysis, transcribing, arranging, recording, and video editing. With that being said, I offer a few rewards for people who want to support me. These range from deciding my next cover to participating in a live stream asking questions. The money that \u003cstrong\u003eyou\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0contribute will be put toward future gear enhancements, album creation (at the time of writing this I am working on my first solo album), always only musical related costs!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for all the support, interest in my work, and welcome to my Patreon channel!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
