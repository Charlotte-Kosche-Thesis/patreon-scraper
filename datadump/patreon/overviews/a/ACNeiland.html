C. Neiland, an up-and-coming author, with a 25-year-old world stuck in my brain, and I am eager to get it into the near-infinite world of literature, and by extension, to you - the novel I am writing, my poetry, prose, short stories, attempts at spoken word, and more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA. C. Neiland is my pseudonym. I am Jennifer \"Catreina\" Snow, a long-time gamer and Twitch streamer.\u00a0I have a long history of enjoying stories in all forms - from the poetry and short stories of Poe, to the plays and stage productions of\u00a0Shakespeare, to video games epics like Mass Effect. I have been surrounded by stories like these since birth. Video games, especially of the role-playing genre, have been my go-to game since a friend of mine invited me over to play Phantasy Star for the Sega Master System. I was instantly hooked - an intriguing story combined with (at the time) amazing graphics and a female protagonist?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSince that day, way back in 1989, I have delved into the worlds of Tyria, Krynn, Westeros, the Underdark, and many more. Each poem, short story, novella, novel, or game I have immersed myself in has conjured up new ideas, people, and locations in my own self-created world. Even with these people, locations, and confrontations living in my mind, I had never thought to bring them out into the light of day until recently.Since I started trying to translate everything from my own grey matter to print, I have had more ideas come flooding from my subconscious to remind me of the adventures I had as a teen and young adult.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(147, 137, 83);\"\u003eWHY PATREON?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003ePatreon allows you, a patron, to become part of a community and feel great about doing so, but there is more to it than that! Becoming a patron grants you some amazing rewards, like early access to in-process chapters, patron-only live streams, even some character or location name collaborations! \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAs my own Patreon community grows, I will be asking patrons for input on the things they would like to see as rewards, input on locations, characters, and events in the universe I am creating. I want patrons to be a part of helping readers explore and uncover the secrets and mysteries that exist in the vast universe that currently resides in my mind. I want patrons to feel like they are a part of my creative process as much as my keyboard or software - required, indispensable, and irreplaceable.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(147, 137, 83);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(147, 137, 83);\"\u003eREWARDS AND GOALS\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003eAt present, there are only a few set rewards and goals.
