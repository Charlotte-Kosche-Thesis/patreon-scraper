    "summary": "Hey guys, my\nname is Alina and I\u2019m an illustrator and artist. I started drawing at the age of 5 and haven\u0027t stopped since. I see myself as a very versatile artist, having worked on everything from old church restoration and furniture decoration to photography, graphic design, clay models, children\u0027s book illustrations and digital painting.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nRight now I\nwork as a freelancer, and most illustration jobs available are for children\u2019s\nbooks. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI love to\nillustrate children\u2019s books but I can do so much more. One of my main problems right now is the fact that working with tight deadlines doesn\u0027t afford me the time I would need to make my illustrations look as good as I\u0027d like them to. I love what I do, but I\u0027d also love to afford to take time off every now and then in order to expand on what I can do and offer the world more of my own, personal work, and make it look the best as I possibly can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf I had enough patrons, I could replace some of the time spent doing commissioned work with time spent expanding my art and building something truly awesome for both myself and you guys to enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThis is\nwhere Patreon and you guys come in.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can\npledge to support me with a dollar or more every time I post a new piece of\nartwork.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will only\nget paid for the art that I label as paid content, but I will often share all\nsorts of sketches, works in progress, and other goodies with my loyal patrons on my feed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou can\nchoose the amount that you want to donate, as well as choosing a monthly\nmaximum so you will never pay more than what you want, or can afford. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo here is\nwhat I want to do: \u003cbr\u003e\n\nAt first,\nI\u2019m going to start with small illustrations and concepts like characters,\nbackgrounds, objects and so on, slowly building one or more, big or small\nworlds. They can even interact at some point ;) \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also like\nsculpting so you could also expect some 3d artwork from time to time.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I get\nmore support from you guys, I can go on to create more complex and awesome\nstuff. Every now and then, I will ask my patrons to suggest a new subject for\nme to illustrate.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI will make\none or more pieces of content every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you so\nmuch for watching and hope to see you on my feed.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nHave a\nawesome day!\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBye!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
