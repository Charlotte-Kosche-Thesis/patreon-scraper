    "summary": "Thank you for visiting my Patreon Page :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s this about?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is an amazing new way for my fans to help contribute to the creation of new art, by making monthly contributions to artists. I\u0027ve setup this page to build an exciting community of like minded beings who are all contributing to the creation of music, videos, live shows, tutorials, reviews, insights from inside the spaceship and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe short version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love to create inspiring, boundary pushing, genre bending music - music that sounds like it\u0027s been downloaded by an alien from the future. I have\u00a02 aliases - Re:Creation, which is based around psytrance, and OverSoul, which is anything from tech-funk to ambient to techno, breaks and everything in between. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI share my music for free, or \u0027pay what you feel\u0027, and I take a lot of time creating the best possible product, with insane attention to detail. It\u0027s become hard to make enough money from the studio to pay the bills and create new music -\u00a0I\u0027m asking patrons to support me by making monthly contributions so that I can spend more time working on creative projects, sharing my knowledge, passions and insights - and you\u0027ll get to vote on what I create next. This will also give me more time to arrange live shows, tours, talks and other exciting projects.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site is awesome, and you are awesome for visiting this page! \u00a0- Check out the cool rewards I\u0027m offering to my Patrons :) and if you don\u0027t feel like contributing as a patron, that\u0027s totally cool, check out my music in the posts on this page, you can download it for free!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d be honoured if you could share this page with people that you think might be interested. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe long version\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me making music is about pushing technology to it\u0027s limits as well as expressing the deepest truths about myself and the world I observe around me, a vibrational journey that takes huge amount of careful attention to manifest into a finished product that can be shared.\u00a0Making this music takes a huge investment of time, energy and money (I\u0027ve been working with music technology since 1999, and since then have spent in excess of 40,000 hours in the studio).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy music is designed to enliven the mind, and enlighten the spirit - Having money shouldn\u0027t determine whether a person should have access to my creativity, so I feel making music available for free or \u0027pay what you feel\u0027 is the fairest way to go. However, these days I have to spend a majority of my time in the studio on client work in order to pay the bills, and it\u0027s increasingly hard to find time to be creative.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in.... As a Patron, you\u0027re not only helping me push my creations to the next level, and spread a vibrational message of love and excitement, you\u0027ll also receive some awesome stuff!! I will be sharing at least one new creation each month - From single tracks, to full albums.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve setup this page to allow me more time to be creative, and to share my creative process with a positive community of awesome people. I\u0027ve been looking for a way to connect with the people who love my music on a deeper level, and Patreon looks like it\u0027s going to help achieve that dream.\u00a0I\u0027m looking for patrons to support me, allowing me more time to create music, and also create videos for the tracks (I\u0027ve been working on 4k resolution and 360 degree / VR next level visuals for my tracks, but don\u0027t have time to create any finished products), as well as tutorials and insights into the creative process. I\u0027ll be sharing exclusive content on my Patreon stream.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis site is a very new thing for me, and I\u0027m sure that the tiers and goals will evolve over time - I really want your feedback as to where this is going to go and what it\u0027s going to become :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve built up a lot of music that I plan to release once a month for the foreseeable future. It all needs some time working on, and a couple of the projects are at about 50% completion - Your support will help me make these into the best possible versions of themselves, and get them into the wide world to inspire some brains with positive vibrations :)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve opted for monthly payments rather than a \u0027per product\u0027 payment - This is because i\u0027m going to be creating lots of different cool stuff - But guarantee that there will be new music every month - There will also be new videos, tutorials and other exciting things, but they may take longer than a month, and not all Patrons will be interested in the same things. I will be hosting regular polls to see what creations I should focus on next based on community feedback :D\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eTHE MASTER PLAN\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1. Release new music every month - It could be a single, EP, album or music video.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2. Generate enough money through music, tutorials and videos to facilitate the building of a next level surround sound studio. I have most of the equipment I need*, I just need to build a new shed and sound-proof it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3. Re-work old tracks and create new tracks in surround / 3d sound*.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e4. Create 2D and 360 degree / VR videos for an immersive, psychedelic A/V experience that can be distributed to people who have a surround sound system, and on VR headsets. As well as stereo versions for sharing online.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e5. Build a large scale surround sound system and geo-dome stage to play the music and video that has been created at festivals and private events. As well as hosting courses in music creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e6. Plan a UK and EU tour with the new stage, offering massive discounts on tickets to Patreon subscribers. (estimated Q4 2019)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e7. Rock human consciousness into the next level through music, vibration, positive intentions, dancing, technology and deep creative expression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e8. Invest profits into the creation of abundance generating machines and technology to create sustainable, technological, positive, creative communities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Surround sound / 3D audio format has yet to be decided, it might end up that I need to invest in some additional equipment to pull it off.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHANK YOU\u003c/strong\u003e for reading this, listening to my music and checking out this page :) \u003cstrong\u003eYou totally rock.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
