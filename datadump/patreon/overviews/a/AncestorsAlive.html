    "summary": "I came here because I love researching, and teaching people how to do their own genealogical research, but a girl\u0027s gotta eat! It can be hard to find students locally, so I am branching out to the internet (BRANCHing, family TREES...get it? Knew ya would.).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started my genealogical research when I was 15. Back then, it was all about folklore and paper records. The internet has added flexibility, amazing tools, and worlds of new data to the work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI majored in many things (didn\u0027t we all?), but I started with folklore and ethnomusicology and ended with history. Along the way, I learned how to work with informants and gather data, how to synthesize what I\u0027d gathered, and how to produce thoroughgoing yet entertaining papers. I learned the value of wholism and originality in research. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThen, I became a lawyer. I gained a love of best evidence and best practices, and learned a way of analyzing records that demanded fair evaluation, critical thinking, and discernment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy old love, genealogy, kept creeping back into my life. A few years out of law school, I realized that this is what I was meant to do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA few years ago, I found that I LOVE TO TEACH. Finding a way to make something clear is so much fun! So, now I do that too. I teach online genealogical research methods to beginners, and shortcuts to EVERYONE, and it\u0027s all a blast.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m here to teach, to learn, to tell stories and to interview folks. Above all, I\u0027m here to create a community so that we can have a great time together. I hope you\u0027ll join me. Thanks so much for your support! It means the world to me."
