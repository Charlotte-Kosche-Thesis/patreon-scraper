In short, I\u0027m an independent rock, alternative, and electronic YouTube musician. Sometimes my music is fan-music (music based off of pop culture TV shows and video games like MLP:FiM and Five Nights at Freddy\u0027s) and sometimes it\u0027s stuff I wrote from my heart. My channel and my music isn\u0027t just a stream of songs, however, it\u0027s a community I like to keep up with, and something I would like to take further.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThat\u0027s where you come in.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eA little help from a few people goes a long way. While I\u0027m currently operating off of the sales of my albums, at least the ones that aren\u0027t already free, a little extra support is going to enable the Aviators channel (and my creative process) to expand infinitely. Some of the big plans I have for the near future include live action music videos, professional animated typography, and audio engineering to polish my sound.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnd that\u0027s only the beginning.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the generous listeners on Patreon really get behind my music, I\u0027ll be able to expand my studio, triple the budget of my albums, and release free content WAY more often. The freedom that comes with individual supporters enables me to not only have complete creative freedom, but it gives you all a chance to be part of that experience. It\u0027s your chance to not only get some music and support me with your donations, but with your inspirations, experiences, and ideas. Tell me your stories.
