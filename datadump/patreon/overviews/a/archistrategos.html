I\u0027m Eliot, eldritch abomination, avid reader, and aspiring writer. Despite writing all my life I feel very tentative about calling myself one until I\u0027ve achieved certain Goals, but we will worry about those later... \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThe most significant influences in my writing (so far) are Lovecraft, Vandermeer, E.E.Cummings, Anne Carson, Ballard, and Nabokov - a strange cocktail of genres that share one common string: visceral, innovative imagery. My goal is to develop my own distinctive style, to find ways to transmit and innovate what I write, and to be able to wear the label of writer proudly. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eSometimes, I might break some grammar in my attempts at creation - it is all in good fun.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is \u003cdel\u003eour Noodle Overlord\u003c/del\u003e\u00a0Xia?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eXia is a talented poetry writer, incredible artist, and master graphics creator with whom I constantly collaborate. We work on graphics and poetry while yelling across continents at unholy hours in the night. She enjoys horror, pretty things, and books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe is forming part of this team to find the well-sought after artistic freedom to create what she likes without constraints.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhy are we teaming up?\u003c/em\u003e Glad you asked! Both of us are creative people but united we aim to\u00a0bringing you something more than just writing and art. We want to innovate through our combined efforts.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eWriting has always been in the periphery of my daily activities, but last year I decided to get serious about sharing my work rather than hoard it a la Smaug within the depths of my computer. I have been sharing my work free online for a while now, and wanted to continue doing so; unfortunately life had other plans as my mother lost her job, and my part-time freelance jobs are not bringing much money or joy to my life. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eLast month, my laptop harakiri\u0027d and I found myself scrabbling to make ends meet since my part-time freelance work requires access to a computer. Thankfully, due to the kindness of people interested in my writing I was able to raise enough money for a new one through commissions. It dawned on me that perhaps writing for a living was not such a hopeless dream, and I decided launch PROJECT X.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWelcome to the PROJECT X\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eAh, the famed letter, symbol, emoticon X (for some of us our worst nightmare in maths class). An infinite amount of possibilities represented by this incongruous letter; I like to think X holds the potential for anything, and that\u0027s the reason behind my naming choice: simplicity and potential for the unknown. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe aim of it is: survive by writing. Simple, right? I have an array of projects all vying for attention, and not enough time to devote to them due to my situation. All money earned here will initially go into food, bills, and helping my mother. Following that some will be squirrelled away into a \"rainy day nest\" because life throws all sorts of unexpected things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eBut\u003c/em\u003e it doesn\u0027t stop there, the more support gained I can also begin pledging to other patrons. I\u0027m a firm believer in giving back to the community, to charity organisations, and lending a hand out to anyone caught in the rain without an umbrella.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn short: your contribution can help me become a writer who can pay their bills, help others, and perhaps gets to travel once a year due solely to revenue made by pure creation.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat do you get? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eMore patrons leads to an increase of free time I can devote to writing, and that\u0027s great, but what exactly do \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e get?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOho, glad you asked because I have such \u003cem\u003eplans\u003c/em\u003e \u003cdel\u003eof world domination\u003c/del\u003e.\u00a0The initial phase of Project X is bring you prose-poetry about monsters, eldritch abominations, world mythologies, fairytales ... and whatever \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e happen to inspire.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor higher paying patrons you will get more personal interactions (photos, sketches, diary entries), titbits of future projects, and input as to what exactly you want to see here. There is also the possibility of further rewards being added to higher tiers.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough this project is intended as a long term one, it\u0027s duration will depend directly on you, my dear patrons. The more you contribute, the more time I can devote to writing, the more \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e get. It is a win/win for all!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much for your consideration \u0026amp; support, I wish you a fantastic, eldritch-filled day!\u003c/div\u003e"
