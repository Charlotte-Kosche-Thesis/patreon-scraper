Even if you are not suffering from an \u0027illness,\u0027 there are over 140 cognitive biases affect everyone. These tools help us understand how our brain works and which philosophies make sense of our mind and lives. Some people have extreme issues like schizophrenia whereas others are a bit misguided and risk not getting the full potential out of life. Wherever you are on the spectrum of mental health, you and the people around you benefit from you learning these tools for yourself and to share with those you come into contact with. \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0When you learn these skills, there is a domino/ripple effect that takes place by showing the use of those skills to others. When someone observes you effectively deal with a conflict situation that results in a win/win scenario for all parties, they are more likely to adopt that technique and use it themselves. \u003cbr\u003e     \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I learned how to transcend negative experiences and communicate tools for the mind. With these tools, my goal is to create a society and culture that is prepared to prevent and deal with our own and others\u0027 mental health issues. \u003cbr\u003e     \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I have already created a philosophy school and a therapeutic community based on the theory I developed. Each member practices living the philosophical principles that I have developed and learns to apply and share these tools, skills and principles. My methods are effective and use up to date science and evidence based practice to promote a healthy living environment. For examples, we do mindfulness and transcendental meditation, practice critical thinking and the philosophy of CBT. \u003cbr\u003e     \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The kind of community that is developed through my philosophical system takes elements from a constructive family/community-like social and extrapolates those mechanisms to society as whole. Elements of being loving, open, and ethical with positive emotional support and constructive criticism so every member can be the best of themselves in their growth. \u003cbr\u003e     \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0With your help, I can focus on researching the relevant information to share in an accessible way. I am focused on organizing the vast amount of information, writing brief descriptions of tools for the website and completion my book, coordinating with existing mental health organizations and schools, creating cultural community events for people to participate and learn, and giving public talks all over the world.\u003cbr\u003e     \u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Thank you for your contribution and making a better world possible. Together we can make a difference and change the history of mental health and happiness for everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAchilles Justice\u003cbr\u003e17.4.18\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eachillesjustice.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
