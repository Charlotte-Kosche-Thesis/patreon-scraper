Creating in \nbursts of inspiration while working at multiple nightclubs as a \nprofessional DJ, nationally touring drummer, and vocal recording engineer for associates was not getting the \ntask done properly in any effective manner.  So I decided to take a \nbreak from all the constant chaos to create a calm environment to create\n some of my best commerce work to date in 2012.  There have been some serious, \"twists \nand turns\" I must admit in my life after making the choice to take break\n from my old schedule.  But I know in the end, I\u0027ve made all the right \ndecisions and the series of recordings will benefit from those \ndecisions - which was/is the original ultimate goal.
