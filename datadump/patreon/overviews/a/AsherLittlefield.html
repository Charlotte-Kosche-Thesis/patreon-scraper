I\u0027m taking the opportunity provided by Patreon to go further with my dream of getting my writing in front of more people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like speculative fiction, science fiction, or future fiction that dabbles in ethics, inside the framework of human curiosity and effort, I think you\u0027ll really like what I write! I carefully edit and revise my writing for a couple weeks, getting advice from several friends who read much of my work and tell me what works and what doesn\u0027t. I don\u0027t take writing lightly. But I also try not to take myself too seriously.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve posted a link (below) to a free novella--\"The Mission of the Maria Celeste\"--in a science fiction series I\u0027m writing called \u0027The History of the Cartographer Colonies.\u0027 This series, inspired by Ray Bradbury\u0027s \u0027Martian Chronicles\u0027 will be my primary focus for the foreseeable future of my Patreon\u0027s existence. I have written five stories in the series, so far, and plan for another five to ten stories. I expect to release one or two stories every month. Some of these stories will be novellas, but most will be between 5,000 and 8,000 words. (Side note: Content won\u0027t run dry after HCC--I have another seven-story series in mind to follow this series.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you support my writing here, I will make sure to give you thoughtfully-written fiction that has been revised with diligence and care. I love writing and I love exploring all that can be explored in the genres of speculative and science fiction, where people face troubling, bizarre, or beautiful things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you enjoy \"The Mission of the Maria Celeste\" and that you come back for more!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOf course, you can always just take a leap and see what it\u0027s all about on the other side of becoming a patron... ;)"
