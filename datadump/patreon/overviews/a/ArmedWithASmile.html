    "summary": "I\u0027ve always had a desire to create art which is what has always helped me keep going in life. Though I was told in school and by my elders in the early 80s that art held no career paths I refused it accept this. For most of my earlier life I was forced into employment roles that I had no desire for, just because it was the \u0027right thing\u0027 to do. However I would draw in my spare time and eventually was able to use some of my creativity in the form of tattooing. Recently after a long period of thought and decades of dealing with depression and substance abuse I decided to change my life for the better and embrace my creative side while travelling and trying to help others. So at the beginning of 2017 and approaching the age of 50, I reduced my life to what I could fit into a back pack and a camera bag and left behind the security of what I knew to travel and try to teach myself photography. I aim to try and constantly improve my skills and techniques by documenting the places I visit and the people I meet that help steer me while I am on this adventure. In an attempt to keep my travelling costs to a minimum to be able to prolong my trip I have found myself experiencing many different situations while on the road. From traveling repeatedly from coast to coast in the united states in the company of some transporters I met while in Mexico, to helping an elderly woman maintain and run a bamboo house in Ecuador, these are just some of the people and experiences I\u0027ve so far encountered while on the road. Hostels, sleeping on sofas or in a hammock and food shopping at markets are the ways in which I\u0027m trying to keep my budget to a minimum to be able to stretch my trip out over the next couple of years. My plan is also to try and join various volunteer projects as I travel to the ten destinations I originally set out to see, so that I get a chance to immerse myself into different cultural situations and can also give something to those people and communities while gaining photographic opportunities. Various people have suggested that I should use my photographic images and artwork to help me achieve my goals and after being made aware of the Patreon site I\u0027ve decided to give it a go. So if you would like to join me on the highs and lows of this trip then I\u0027d appreciate your support in whatever way you can. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0I currently am only able to create posts when I can find access to a PC as my travelling electronic equipment only contains a tablet. Therefore I will not be able to post as frequently as I was hoping though I will be doing my best to remedy this situation. Another challenge for me to overcome as I travel!\u003cbr\u003e"
