Whether you contribute or not, I always welcome feedback or suggestions and hope you enjoy the game. If not, feel free to tell me why it sucks :p\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn the spirit of self-disclosure, let me first state this is a new hobby of mine. I tend to enjoy adult games and have always had a thing for adult-oriented art; specifically anime and 3D. I have no previous experience and am currently using the project as the means to teach myself and pass time between college classes.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile a lot of sites feature straight content, the gay content for visual novels is extremely sparse. Many games were launched with Kickstarter and took a significant period of time before any of us saw any of the content. While some newer games are in the works, there\u0027s pretty much nothing for us right now.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn contrast, I noticed that many sites feature Patreon-created adult games and users get to experience the updates as they launch. The problem here is they\u0027re mostly straight content.\u00a0Furthermore, most of it features completely shaved guys (I\u0027m not a fan).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/UvlLBJX.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn \n\u003cstrong\u003eStraight?!, \u003c/strong\u003ethings are gonna be a bit different. Straight?! is a gay visual novel/ game combo that follows the coming-of-age tale of Zack, a 19-year-old college student on his first day of college and the antics that ensue when he quickly meets his new roommate: 18-year-old, Braden.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe focus of this game will be:\u00a0\u00a0\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/w6Evk2M.png\" style=\"background-color: initial; width: 279px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong style=\"background-color: initial;\"\u003eDialogue: \u003c/strong\u003eToo many games have poor or unrealistic\u00a0 \u00a0dialogue. I want my characters to have natural dialogue\u00a0 \u00a0that moves the story forward or gives you insight into their\u00a0 \u00a0personality. Thus, there may be time spent on banter\u00a0 \u00a0between the characters or meaningless debates.\u00a0 \u00a0Additionally, the characters will have distinct viewpoints and perspectives on issues. The goal here is that Tarantino-esque dialogue.\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/7NbrJtQ.png\" style=\"width: 277px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eCharacter Development: \u003c/strong\u003eDialogue will move the characters but events will hopefully be more realistic. I want to take some aspects slow, simply to allow us, the audience, to suffer along with the characters. On the downside, this means that we will not jump straight into sexual content. Characters have to slowly become more comfortable with nudity and we will experience this along with the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cdel\u003e\u003c/del\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cdel\u003eStereotypes:\u003c/del\u003e \u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m throwing gay stereotypes out the window. Fuck that! I want to give characters some depth. Therefore you may have characters struggle with religious issues or completely ignore major cultural expectations associated with their sexuality. I did this not to be offensive but to broaden the depth and fluidity of the character\u0027s viewpoints.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/CQTu17n.png\" style=\"width: 264px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003e\u00a0Pubes: \u003c/strong\u003eFor crying out loud, I\u0027m tired of bald dick dudes in\u00a0 \u00a0games; specifically the straight games! While I plan to use\u00a0 \u00a0a similar Genesis model as other games have shared, I\u00a0 \u00a0have taken time to add pubic, pit, and happy trail hair.This\u00a0 \u00a0will hopefully make things a bit more realistic.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003eProfanity: \u003c/strong\u003eWhile we may add characters later, the two main characters are foul-mouthed as hell. They\u0027re just boys being boys.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThere are a lot of firsts for me here. This is my first visual novel, first time with 3D art, and first time on Patreon. While I would like to dedicate all the time I can to the project, the main purpose is for me to enjoy the work I\u0027m doing. \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eWhile I will try to update monthly, I cannot promise this \u003c/strong\u003eas I do have a full-time job, a full-time student, and recently began a full-time internship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xKU7wXm.png\" style=\"width: 276px; float: right; margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;\"\u003eWhile my game will be free to all, the purpose of using Patreon is to enlist the help and feedback of others, and to maybe get some pizza money on the side for the time I sink in. Thus, \n\t\u003cstrong\u003eI view the ongoing Patreon support as more of a monthly donation than a requirement. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tHowever, Patreons can obtain early access 1 month before free release. I am not a greedy person so I\u0027m not trying to get rich. Plus, I\u0027m too much of a newb to know wtf I\u0027m doing yet anyway to actually charge for this shit :p\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tThanks again for stopping by and drop me a line if you have questions or suggestions, hit me up.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t-Aaryn-\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
