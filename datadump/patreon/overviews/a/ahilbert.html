    "summary": "Howdy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve had this idea for a comic book character since I was a kid. A friend and I were trying to come up with a killer superhero when we realized that all the good animals were taken. We landed on a deer because nobody was a deer and deer still seemed to kick ass.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward two decades and the damn thing is still banging around in my head. I wanted to try something different with how I release DeerMan. I want to serialize it and release it in audio chapters once a month. Nobody has to pay for it but I\u0027d sure appreciate it if some folks would patronize it. And, to show you my thanks, you\u0027ll be getting early access to everything related to DeerMan.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, DeerMan is no longer exactly a superhero as he was first envisioned. He\u0027s just a drunk who ran into a deer on his way home from the bar and his mangled body was put in the hands of a mad scientist. DeerMan is out for revenge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce DeerMan finishes, I plan on serializing other ideas I have and releasing them in the same form. These will culminate in paperback releases of the finished product.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much for stopping by and I hope you\u0027ll consider becoming a patron. Every little bit helps keep things moving.\u00a0"
