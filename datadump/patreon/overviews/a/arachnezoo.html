Maybe this kind of artist even has children or other things they have to take care of, like studio rent, because this kind of artist works so much better when there is a dedicated functional space that isn\u0027t so cold you can hardly move, and/or isn\u0027t surrounded by the laundry, the washing up and disturbing visits from the postie or the Jehovah\u0027s Witnesses. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eJoin The Experiment\u003c/h3\u003eThis is part of an art project for 2017-2018:\u003ca href=\"http://sarahdixonfineart.co.uk/category/an-investigation-into-how-to-fund-an-art-practice/\"\u003e An Investigation Into How To Fund An Art Practice\u003c/a\u003e in which I am exploring existing and new, sometimes absurdist or impossible models for funding the production of art.

So no promises. Doesn\u0027t mean it won\u0027t happen. \u00a0Thanks for participating in this thrilling social experiment and maybe even contributing to the much-needed downfall of capitalism.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe art you can expect to see includes frameworks for you to take up and play with, like \u003cstrong\u003eThe Ritual Burning of Unwanted Art\u003c/strong\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://sarahdixonfineart.co.uk/projects/mother-bunting-invitation/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMother Bunting\u003c/a\u003e.
