I\u0027m just your average everyday starving artist, hoping to eliminate \"starving\" from my title.\u003cbr\u003eI create all types of artistic media from comic books and animation, to promotional videos and wrestling matches -- I prepare custom ordered signs and T-shirts, and just about anything else you want custom made.\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to create artwork to entertain and inspire people; I can only do this if I get paid for my work. That\u0027s where you come in. Becoming a patron will help fund day-to-day operations of Able Media and potentially help me hire additional artists to assist in my work. Not to mention patrons received discounts on\u003cstrong\u003e ALL \u003c/strong\u003eAble Media products - so if you ever decide to get any thing custom made for yourself or as a gift, your patronage will pay for itself.\u003cbr\u003eThanks again,\u003cbr\u003eSincerely,\u003cbr\u003eYour Friendly Neighborhood Babyface (that\u0027s wrestling talk for \"good-guy\")\u003cbr\u003e"
