It is all in \u003cstrong\u003eDollars\u003c/strong\u003e, but I am not in the US, I understand this can be quite frightful for some, but it needn\u0027t be. It\u0027s a different currency, yes, but in actuality, it means that \u003cstrong\u003ethings costs you less\u003c/strong\u003e.

In \"Little Picture\" I studied and spoke about the refugee and homelessness crisis throughout the world and in \"Lull\", mental health and mindfulness.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThree times a week I intreview someone and schedule their picture as part of my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/arthurjohndove\"\u003eLittle Pictures collaboration on Instagram\u003c/a\u003e. The idea is to explore other people\u0027s views, to help remind me, well, us, that we all have one.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI have synaesthesia, I\u003cem\u003e feel \u003c/em\u003ecolour when I \u003cem\u003ehear \u003c/em\u003emusic. We all have our own little slice of reality, and I\u0027m fascinated by it. Little Pictures is one way of exploring that idea. I\u0027ve been running workshops in schools, colleges and universities exploring it even further. Where Little Pictures is seeing other peoples views, this was hearing them, through other peoples reinterpretations of the song, Little Picture. (This is still a bit secret!)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI blended my own teas, that taste like the songs I release. It\u0027s the world\u0027s first and only enhanced reality tea, it\u0027s called\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://arthurjohndove.bigcartel.com/category/tea\"\u003eRealiTea\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s a truly unique, immersive experience of Arthur Dove.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI started\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://youtube.com/arthurjohndove\"\u003eTea Talk\u003c/a\u003e on Youtube where we review and talk about all things tea. I stopped drinking alcohol a while ago, and tea filled the void. I want to share the possibilities of tea, with as many people as I can.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eI enjoy teaching, I think it helps me to learn. I\u0027ve been singing and meditating for a long time, and I want to improve both,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://arthurjohndove.bigcartel.com/products\"\u003eso, I teach them\u003c/a\u003e. One on one, sometimes in a group. I\u0027ve helped a few people along the way. It\u0027s self indulgent (but then I believe everything is self motivated) it makes me feel good to be useful.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.arthurjohndove.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BigcartelTop.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHY PATREON\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a really cool idea, it puts you, someone who enjoys some of the things I\u0027ve been working on to essentially become the head of the record label.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is kind of somewhere between a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/about?ref=nav\"\u003eKickstarter\u003c/a\u003e and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.spotify.com/us/\"\u003eSpotify\u003c/a\u003e. It\u0027s a crowd funded subscription service but instead of subscribing to music, in general, you\u0027re subscribing to the creator of it. I guess what you\u0027re subscribing to is me, or my ideas; that\u0027s anything and everything that I do, whenever I do them. In return you\u0027ll get some pretty cool things, that nobody else will, which is a bit like kickstarter.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the price of a cup of tea or a used book you can really help keep me doing the things I\u0027ve been doing, these things I think help me and you to be better. In keeping with this idea of exchanging betterness, I\u0027ve a suggestion...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo help me, help yourself. Why not try to reduce how often you smoke? Or how often you drink alcohol or caffeine? Maybe try to ignore the will of consumerism? My suggestion would be, if you\u0027ve enjoyed anything I\u0027ve done, or I\u0027m currently doing, or you think you\u0027ll enjoy anything else then use that saved money to help create more of it. I really need your help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe better, to help me be better, to help others be better. Repeat.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.arthurjohndove.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BigcartelTop.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHOW YOU HELP\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working with this for a year now, I think the realisation that I wanted it to be a community of collaborators came pretty early on in the process. Things just feel better with a collective behind them, the results I\u0027ve seen with the music, with the tea, everything I\u0027ve done, reflects that idea. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve already had so much help with everything, I get that it could look like it\u0027s just one person but it really isn\u0027t. Whether it\u0027s been feedback on the music, your contributions to\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://instagram.com/arthurjohndove\"\u003eLittle Pictures on Instagram\u003c/a\u003e, help with artwork and design, generating ideas, building the website, you name it, I\u0027ve been helped (and I\u0027m probably missing loads of stuff out there). Since the beginning, I\u0027ve been trying to think of the steps I could take to build a stronger community around my music, and then Patreon fell in my lap.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re here with me, reading this, then you\u0027ve enjoyed one of the things that I\u0027ve done. You\u0027ve felt better because of it. This feeling better is just a merry-go-round. You hop on it because you think it\u0027ll make you feel better, when it does you stick around a little longer, but, what you hadn\u0027t realised is that being on it, could help make someone else feel better too, so, you encourage others to get on. That\u0027s how you help. It starts with you feeling better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s all \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(75, 172, 198);\"\u003e#Bebetter\u003c/span\u003e together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
