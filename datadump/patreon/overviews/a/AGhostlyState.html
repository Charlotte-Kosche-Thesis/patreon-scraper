    "summary": "Hello! My name is Jamison O\u0027Bryan, but you guys can call me Jamie. As i\u0027m sure you can see-- I like to draw things. I\u0027m trying to earn an income by doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003eLets get to the mushy stuff.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been going to an alternative school since 8th grade. I\u0027ve been drawing primarily since elementary school, and my specialty is drawing people.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to make a steady income, as I would like to draw for a living. I would also like to help support my family, given my mother is currently unemployed. This leaves my dad as the only one in the house with a stable income, and he isn\u0027t getting paid what he\u0027s worth. I want to help my parents, because honestly, my dad is way too overworked, and my mom is taking the summer off before finding a new job.\u003cbr\u003eI support LGBTQA+ rights, and focus mostly on drawing fandom art as of late, however that may change. So far my current fandoms are Hamilton, Borderlands (Please talk to me if you like Borderlands), and several others I can\u0027t remember, off the top of my head!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m genuinely unsure how this is supposed to work, but I\u0027m hopeful that I can learn! I\u0027m going to try my best to give you all everything I can, and I hope you can be patient while I grasp at the reigns a bit for the first few months.\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re interested in being a Patron of mine, Great!  I\u0027ll do my best to make it worth your while. If you decide not to opt in, you could still help, by spreading the word about my Patreon for me.\u003cbr\u003eEven if you can\u0027t become a Patron, even if you don\u0027t have the money,  it\u0027s okay. Even if you could afford it, you don\u0027t have to. But if you could spread the word, I would be very appreciative. I know this probably sounds like many other descriptions on here, but I mean it from the bottom of heart. Thank you for reading this, and for being interested enough to visit my Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e"
