My name is Andrea and I am an independent musician from Australia and make a living solely from my music.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMY PLAN\u003c/b\u003e - I am about to embark on my second independent tour of Europe. I am self managed, book all the shows, send hundreds of emails, create youtube clips, send more emails, and find just enough time in between all of this to write new songs. I plan on releasing a new album within the next twelve months and think that this is a great way to create and share new songs and ideas with you and be able to make a living.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eHOW IT ALL WORKS\u003c/b\u003e - These are exciting times for independent artists and I am so thankful to be able to do what I love!\u00a0 Patreon is like an ongoing crowd funding campaign. How it works is: When I create a new song, I upload it to Patreon and my supporters who have made a pledge will receive their selected reward. For example you can pledge $1 per song/video that I create. You can also control how much you pledge and can set a limit how much you pledge per month (just in case I write 100 songs in a month!). I plan to be making some videos (like the one above) while touring overseas so I can share the adventures as well as new demos of songs. I estimate it will be one to two songs per month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cb\u003eMY STORY SO FAR\u003c/b\u003e - I\u0027ve been working solidly on my music since about 2007. I bought a one way ticket to France and from there went on to record my first EP and album in the UK with Big Al at The Sonic Kitchen Studios and got the tracks mastered at Abbey Road Studios in London. I\u0027ve been incredibly lucky with support from my partner, family and friends and the industry. Last year I won \u0027Adult Contemporary\u0027 and \u0027Female Vocals\u0027 categories at the North Coast Music Industry Awards for my song: \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/andreasoler17\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eDaydreamer. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/user/andreasoler17\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/T9tpIT3Zr7M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you would like to know anymore information about me before deciding to pledge...please check out \u003ca rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.andreasoler.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n"
