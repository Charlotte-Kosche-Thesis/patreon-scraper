    "summary": "My name is Ander or Andy, I am a Triathlete, I have been doing this for almost 10 years. This began as a challenge and a bet, with some friends while we were having dinner one night, and a lot has changed since then.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat started as a challenge has changed a lot. I was fat, and didn\u0027t knew what to do. \u00a0I did Triathlon to have fun and to exercise, and never ever thought about finishing top ten or qualifying to the World Championship and being a reference to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI never thought I could achieve this, watching people win made me desire to get there, and little by little, one day at the time, I start believing and doing it possible. That is something I tell everybody, that you can do it, you just need to believe you can!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQualifying for a\u00a0World Championship it\u0027s not easy, it means training for an Ironman everyday at 3 in the morning and it\u0027s a very difficult, specially doing it alone, it takes a lot of discipline. This training also includes sessions at the pool and hitting the track and sometimes even after work going to the gym to workout. It\u0027s a very demanding road to success, but becomes easier when you love doing it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides a big amount of will, sadly, a lot of this comes down to money. For nutrition, coach, gym, bike maintenance and parts, inscription fees....your pledge will help me a lot to keep fighting for my goals so I can participate in more competitions, can give a good maintenance to my bike, get all my vitamins, proteins and gels, have a proper nutrition, pay my coach and gym and to be in perfect condition and to get to be know \u00a0better, because I have been limited to a couple of \u00a0competitions outside my local area and that doesn\u0027t help me to get better.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not easy and it needs a lot of will of power to do it. And sometimes the body doesn\u0027t want to go any further and the easiest option is to stop, but it is that heroic moment when need to put your feet on the floor and don\u0027t look back and keep going, and when you cross the finish line you will look back and feel very proud of you because you didn\u0027t give up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
