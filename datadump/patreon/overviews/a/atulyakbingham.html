     "about": "Hello! I\u0027m Atulya K Bingham author of \u00a0Mud Ball and the prize-winning novel Ayse\u0027s Trail. Nowadays, I\u0027m also a natural builder and mud plaster expert.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor five years, I\u0027ve been single-handedly running\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.themudhome.com\"\u003eThe Mud Home\u003c/a\u003e website, which offers free information on earthbag building, off-grid living, how to make houses out of mud and personal insights into the a freer way of living. The Mud earthbag building PDF has been downloaded well over 15 000 times, and that PDF is followed up by a ten week email information package for would-be earthbaggers and off-gridders. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUntil now, I have given my time, information and resources for absolutely nothing. I believe that having a safe, warm shelter is a human right, one that shouldn\u0027t require a life of drudgery to pay back a mortgage, and I love to inspire people. However, as my email list tops 10 000, managing the site requires more funds, time and assistance than I can give alone. In order for others to benefit from the same information, the site, internet connection, hosting, email providers all have to be paid. Not to mention the man hours I pour into it to keep it running. I require some basics too; I need to take care of my health for a start.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you give to me via Patreon, you allow the Mud Home site to grow so that others can download my free PDFs and books. You also help sustain me, so that I can continue to share my experience in the field. If I\u0027m gifted over $500 a month, it would enable me to hire some assistance, so that instead of wasting hours trying to unravel the tech side of running a website, I can concentrate on and produce a lot more of what I\u0027m best at, which is writing.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut honestly, these are the practicalities. There\u0027s something far more important you do for me when you support me, whether with a dollar a month or 20 dollars. You are acknowledging that what I have created over the past 5 years has some sort of value either for you personally or for humanity as a whole. You inspire me to keep going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupporting me and The Mud Home is an action of the heart, and I\u0027m deeply grateful to every patron.\u003cbr\u003e",
