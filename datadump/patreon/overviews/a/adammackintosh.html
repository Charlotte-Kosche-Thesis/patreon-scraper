    "summary": "Dearest Patrons, something I wish to express to anyone considering supporting my efforts is that I am more than just a songwriter seeking support. Yes, that is what you will be supporting here but I have a larger vision of myself as a contributor to my immediate and extended communities. It was a revelation for me many years ago to discover that I could be much, much more. An educator, an ambassador for \u003ca href=\"http://www.rockschoolfund.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003escholarship foundations\u003c/a\u003e, a public speaker to teenage entrepreneurs (\u003ca href=\"http://www.nfte.org\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eNFTE\u003c/a\u003e), a user interface consultant to charitable web entities like (\u003ca href=\"http://www.tix4cause.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003etix4cause.com\u003c/a\u003e) who raise money for charities through concert ticket sales. Helping raise awareness for The Who charity\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.teencanceramerica.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.teencanceramerica.com\u003c/a\u003e and much, much more...And I know I could give back even more with your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s the idea. But it all starts with the support of Patrons like you who can make the dream a little bit more real. If you dig that, sign up and become a Patron. If you need more insight into what I\u0027m talking about, Read more...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecoming a mentor, a person who can empower and inform anyone lacking basic access to the toolbox that will build their dreams and widening the circle with the empowerment I receive is what I want to achieve. Writing, recording and performing music is the fuel and the conduit through which I connect and exchange a real kind of magnetism with other people, the air I breathe. I believe supporters will find that that I give back 2 to 3 times what I receive. With your support, I will be able to create many more songs, much more live documentation of what it is we\u0027re doing right now at our writing and recording desks, in the studio and on stage and volunteer even more of my time. The video above is the only captured performance of our live band, \u003ca href=\"http://www.adammackintosh.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eThe Last Dancers\u003c/a\u003e, low quality, zero budget. For a higher quality, five camera HD video performance please\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/f3i9PjRMNbE\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eclick here\u003c/a\u003e and get a little perspective on my versatility as a songwriter and performer. A great honor to be one of the first inductees into The Purdue University \u003ca href=\"https://www.purdue.edu/convocations/the-lomax-project-community-field-recordings/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAlan Lomax Project\u003c/a\u003e with Jayme Stone. As I build bigger goals, more audio and video documentation will become possible and educational content will become a component.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy reviews on \u003ca href=\"http://www.learnivore.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eLearnivore.com\u003c/a\u003e show my record of mentor-ship in my teaching from parents and students alike and also verify my identity from fellow instructors. Thank you for reading and any more time you put into considering supporting a person with these easily attainable goals. There is much more detail in my rewards section, and much more I wish to give...please read on!\u003cbr\u003eSincerely, Adam Mackintosh\u003cbr\u003e"

     "description": "Mentoring is a separate function of what I do. (Listed in goals below) For those interested...For $250/mo I will personally Mentor your musically gifted and talented child through the un-navigable straits of the ever changing \"music industry\". Two truths: \u003cbr\u003e1. Your kids won\u0027t listen to you. \u003cbr\u003e2. They need someone who knows how the \"music industry\" works (hint: it doesn\u0027t) and knows the people who can help them succeed if they are destined to do this. You will know pretty fast if they are. Comes with personal Cell #. ( if under 18) Group Email. Group text. \u00a0Group chat on FB with parent allowed access to view (not comment). If you have questions, please send here. If not, just select $250 as monthly pledge amount and connect me with the artist. Thank you!",
