    "summary": "Hey hazbros, stink nuts, ziggy noses, or listeners of The Awkward High Five Podcast that prefer not to be referred to by some silly show related pet name, thanks for finding us here. For two guys who came up in the DIY punk scene, asking for monetary support of a creative project feels foreign and icky plus puts us in danger of forever being haunted by the ghost of Ian MacKaye* but we\u0027re sucking up our foolish and undeserved pride for the betterment of this show we love doing so much.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur goal is to expand the show as much as possible by rounding up some video equipment so we can have both audio and video options, doing a live show at least once a week where we can have live call ins, and eventually finding a bigger and better studio where we can have listeners come hang with us during the show. Also, there\u0027s a hole in RTG\u0027s Raritan Rockets beanie that we\u0027d like to get sewed up for preservation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor anyone who decides to become a patron of AHi5 on any tier level, we thank you in advance for your support. And if you\u0027re not the money giving type or are on the RTG \"shoving pre made Quick Chek subs down your pants\" style budget there\u0027s other ways to support the show that we appreciate just as much like giving us a written review on\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/awkward-high-five-podcast/id1054465312?mt=2\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eiTunes\u003c/a\u003e, calling \u003cstrong\u003e607-319-AHI5\u003c/strong\u003e and leaving us a message, or spreading the AHi5 word to others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027ve never heard the show and want to know what you\u0027re getting into, below is a more formal show description. Ok love you bye.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*THIS JUST IN: Ian MacKaye NOT dead or a ghost. He\u0027s actually still a relatively young guy living in the greater Washington D.C. area.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSHOW DESCRIPTION\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe Awkward High Five Podcast is a podcast hosted by Ritchie Giordano and Devin Ferry that mixes comedy and pop culture with an inside look at some of life\u0027s real problems like addiction, relationships, and searching for your place in the world. In 2015, after finding themselves at respective low points in their lives, Dev and Ritchie created AHi5 as a way to start entertaining again and to mend a 30 year friendship of doing everything together from working shitty food service jobs to touring in punk rock bands. Since then AHi5\u0027s open and honest take on talk radio and podcasting has attracted a community of loyal listeners that continues to grow.
