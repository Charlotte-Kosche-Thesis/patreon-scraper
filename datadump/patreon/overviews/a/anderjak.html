I\u0027d really like to make my own comics full-time, though. That\u0027s why we\u0027re here, on Patreon -- to make the dream of full creative freedom become reality.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been published on SlipShine and a small number of zines, but largely make comics for a public audience through Tumblr and Twitter. In addition, I\u0027m launching a new comic called \u003cstrong\u003eSUPER-BOREDOM\u003c/strong\u003e this Summer, about the incredibly powerful daughter of legendary supervillains, and her defiance to the legacy of being \"super-\" anything. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt isn\u0027t the only story I\u0027d love to have published, however, and with your support, I\u0027m more able to work on multiple unique comics that I\u0027d love to digitally publish for free to anyone who wishes to view them. Patreon facilitates that by letting patrons contribute \u003cem\u003eDIRECTLY\u003c/em\u003e to the artist rather than through a middle-man, assuring that you can vote with your dollar in the most efficient way possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a benefit to being a patron, I\u0027d like to give back by providing sketches, works in progress, and even early access to completed comics -- including works that may not see the light of day! On rare occasion, I take commission work outside of my comic work, but patrons who contribute at certain tiers get exclusive slots \u003cem\u003eEVERY MONTH\u003c/em\u003e, regardless of whether I take commissions publicly or not -- which means you\u0027re getting \u003cem\u003eMORE\u003c/em\u003e art, \u003cem\u003eGUARANTEED\u003c/em\u003e, without a reduction in quality on my comic work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always looking for ways to create new benefits for patrons, too. I\u0027d like to include livestreams, Q\u0026amp;A, polls, and more ways to get involved while still providing the best content I can make as regularly as I can. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, back to comics. It is always comic time.\u003cbr\u003e"
