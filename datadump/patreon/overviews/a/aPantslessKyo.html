Get back in character]\u003cbr\u003eOk ok... sheesh..\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnnnyways, my name is Kyo, I\u0027m part asian, part comedian, all around gamer and multi-personified individual that plays vidjagames on the interwebs and attempts to make with the funny while you lurk! My passion is gaming, and I do enjoy entertaining streams, youtube videos, and reviews, so I figured \"Why not make my own?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I have... for about a year and some change\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUp above is an early attempt at what it is that I do -er... did rather, back when I was just starting out in the wide open world sandbox adventure that is streaming publicly:\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIt was low budget \u003cbr\u003e[still is] \u003cbr\u003eand mildly entertaining \u003cbr\u003e[if you call it entertainment] \u003cbr\u003eand overall the start of chapter in my life I will never forget \u003cbr\u003e[considering you forgot about 90% of the games you rage quit]\u003cbr\u003e so... wait.. the fuck me?! What\u0027d I do to you?! \u003cbr\u003e[you remember Dark Souls DLC runs?!?!?]\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e*sniffle* I thought we weren\u0027t going to talk about that again...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays I stream almost exclusively PC games, provided I have and/or can run them. Mostly because of audio delays in game from the PS4 capture, which is more than mildly annoying and the cause of my rage quit on Dark Souls III DLC.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo why Patreon? Why attempt something so bold, yet possibly fruitless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBecause Raisins? Because I enjoy whoring myself to you, the people? WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME!?!?!?!?! *sobs*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHonestly because this endeavor isn\u0027t cheap, and I will happily accept outside support from the people that enjoy what I do just as much, or possibly even moreso, than I do: you, the viewer!!\u003cbr\u003e*DUH DUH DUH DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUH* (Zelda fanfare noises and junk)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what rewards do we have in place? \u003cbr\u003eSave for possible Patron streams, not much atm, subject to change immediately\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat can you, as a Patron, expect of me?\u003cbr\u003eThe best quality I can muster, as well as requests and polite nods and fanfare in your honor, complete with banana stickers*\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat are my goals and dreams?\u003cbr\u003eWell, the ultimate goal is to make this my living and provide Youtube and Twitch content for your entertainment, as well as meet n greets and events! As for my dreams... you really don\u0027t want to know...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat will your money go to?\u003cbr\u003ePC upgrades\u003cbr\u003eGames\u003cbr\u003eRecording Equipment\u003cbr\u003eEditing Software\u003cbr\u003eGames\u003cbr\u003eSystems\u003cbr\u003eGames\u003cbr\u003eFoodstuffs\u003cbr\u003eGames\u003cbr\u003eRent (eventually)\u003cbr\u003eand moar GAMES!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe limits of what I can do with your continued help is boundless, but I\u0027m not going to keep things from you just because you can\u0027t donate. This is just for those that have the excess funds and wish to support a gamer who in his prime... was a gamer... that played... games... LIKE YOU!!! maybe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will be invited to patron exclusive streams, as well as Subscriber exclusive streams (where we invite the wonderful fools you are to suffer with/against me in a videogame of mutual choosing) as well as be the first to call dibs on whatever games are up for play at the end of a series! More rewards to come later!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd with that, I leave you with that wonderfully pitiful video from yesteryear, please follow and tell your friends to come check out the Twitch and Twitter for status updates on my streams, as well as TacoNation streamers!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor your consideration (as Glorious Leader),\u003cbr\u003eKyo~\u003cbr\u003e"
