I\u0027m a 20 year old student of creative writing, with a love of all things artistic. Being inventive, imaginative and creative is something that I have always been passionate about - not just with words, but with anything I set my hands to!\u003cbr\u003eI have been working excitedly on my jewellery and sculptures since May 2017, and although I adore the creative process itself from start to finish, the materials I need to bring customers the absolute best (both creatively and with quality) can be expensive and time consuming to work with! Since I am (as almost all new businesses are) struggling to make the sales I need right now to cover all the costs, I thought I would start up this page so that anyone who wants to support me can do so, without necessarily splashing out on my pieces themselves!\u003cbr\u003eSo for anyone who has, is, or will be donating, I want to thank you so much from the bottom of my heart, as you will be making what I do possible and actually making my dreams come true, to keep creating imaginative pieces for others to enjoy! ^_^ Thank you for reading!"

     "about": "Hey all!\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Alexia, currently the sole designer/artist/crafter and owner of Alexia\u0027s Adornarium. I\u0027m a 20 year old formemr student of creative writing, with a love of all things artistic. Being inventive, imaginative and creative is something that I have always been passionate about - not just with words, but with anything I set my hands to!\u003cbr\u003eBack in 2015, I visited Glastonbury for the first time, and that experience changed my life. Never before had I been to such a spiritual place, and I became determined to make my own jewellery that captured the free-spiritedness, the love of fantasy, and reverence for nature that permeated the area, and all of the items that were sold there.\u003cbr\u003eBack in May 2017, I finally decided to put my ideas into practice and began crafting polymerclay pendants. This material very much suited my aims as it was just as flexible and versatile as someone with my imagination needed! Then, as I worked more on perfecting my craft, the name for what would become my jewellery business was formed in my mind: Alexia\u0027s Adornarium. \u003cbr\u003e\u0027Adornarium\u0027 is a combination of two words, \u0027adornments\u0027 and \u0027imaginarium\u0027, and I knew that this would be perfect, as it encapsulated not only what I would be selling, but also what I hoped my shop would be - a place dedicated to the imagination!\u003cbr\u003eTo this day, my jewellery is comprised mostly of polymerclay and resin pieces, but my aim is to develop my skills and expand my knowledge so that I can eventually make more fine jewellery out of precious metals and even more exotic crystals. Ideally, this will all be whilst retaining the wild, free, and imaginative themes I strive to convey in all of my work!\u003cbr\u003eSo stick around, because the only thing you can expect to be in Alexia\u0027s Adornarium is the magical - and the unexpected!",
