    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9pvhOSD.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey there! I\u0027m Aron Dark, and welcome to my Fiction Writing Patreon Page. Who am I, you may ask. I am a Veteran of the United States Coast Guard where I was a cook for 10 years. I also have a Bachelors Degree in Information Technology. As great as these things are, my greatest achievement in life are my wife and kids. I have been happily married for 13 years and have 3 wonderful (and mischievous) children. I also own a cat and a black lab, which I think grants me bonus internet points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have tried many things in my life. Blacksmithing, Woodworking, Streaming, and Painting are just a few examples. I have failed at many things, and succeeded at far less. But with my failures I\u0027ve learned. With a life filled with so much learning, I am poised to share stories with you. I hope to bring you interesting short stories and an engaging novel this year. And more as the years go on!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WvLxg5F.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy dog Skye eats a lot and I need help buying dog food. But mainly I wanted to get my writing out on a platform that supports the work of other artists. Though I have always been a very proficient story teller, this is the first time I am putting those stories to paper. My main goal is to create fun and interesting characters and worlds for you to read. And without further ado....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/xDroXkC.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScience fiction writing is what you can expect. Currently there are two novels I am working on. One takes a lot of time and research so I am fleshing it out before releasing the first few chapters. My main novel is a space trade adventure; think Han Solo without saving the galaxy and more hi-jinks. Short stories will vary greatly and are sure to be fun to read. I hope you will join me on this journey as I want to complete this novel by December of 2017. Also, expect new chapters and updates regularly!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/p8iy2vB.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd this, my friends, is the million dollar question. I plan to release a short story and new chapters for my novel twice a month. Of course I would love to do more, and if I can, I will. The chapters will be free, but early access to the chapters are tied to tiers. This gives you the opportunity to get an early peak at the story, and also assist me with ideas or possible spelling/grammar problems (I\u0027m Human). Patreon rewards also include access to the community Discord, and a weekly Panel with me to discuss stories so far.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat decision lies with you. I will continue to push out stories, and you will always have the opportunity to read for free as my novel progresses. The biggest way to support me is by reading my material, giving me constructive feedback, and sharing my work with your friends. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
