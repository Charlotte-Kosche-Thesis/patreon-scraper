I\u0027m grateful for your attention, and I like to know that my interests are shared.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a small child, I dreamed about gigantic women coming into my town, seeking me out for ultra-grade cuddles. In college I wrote a story in which an acquaintance\u0027s girlfriend shrunk me down and used me for her pleasure. Since then I\u0027ve been creating and visiting worlds in which people are enlarged or shrunken through technology, spells and potions, curses, or naturally come in those proportions, and exploring what love and lust and relationships look like between them. And some of you like the way I arrange the words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope to provide more of that, even as I study ways to better tell these stories. I\u0027d like to round them out with forays into artwork, audiobooks, photography, and video. If you like my spin on these things, I would greatly value your support."
