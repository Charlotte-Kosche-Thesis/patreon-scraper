    "summary": "This creator needs more assistance in having more time to research and write and broadcast more on contemporary issues of significance to everyone, without diminishing our Monastery ministries. See our broadcasts on YouTube and our publications at www.synaxispress.ca.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn our ministry, we have four main \u00a0points, apart from daily monastic life. Vladika Lazar is a successful mentor for people in drug rehab programmes. We support the programme caring for street people and contribute food for low-income seniors. The fourth major aspect of our work is in broadcasting and publishing. The monastery grounds have also become a \"refuge\" for many Orthodox families living in small apartments in the city. At the same time, we have a very limited income with few donations, usually small ones even on Sundays and the buildings need repairs. Patronage that we receive would help in all our ministries. We need assistance with the general maintenance of the monastery buildings and the property and we do not want to \"short change\" the assistance we provide for others."
