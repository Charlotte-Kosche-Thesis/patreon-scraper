I\u0027m getting by with a Real Job (plus selling plasma) that pays the bills and puts pizza on the table, but as they always told us in school, it\u0027s important to follow your heart. And my heart is saying, \"Avery. You are a poet. Go make a patreon so that you can get paid to be a poet. Also, have you considered getting 13 more cats?\"\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere\u0027s also the fact that my Real Job isn\u0027t much. I\u0027m a housekeeper, and while I truly do think the job is a good one, it pays $8.35 an hour. As I said, I am getting by, but I could really use some extra money for savings, important things I\u0027ve been putting off (like a vacuum cleaner), and possibly college. I\u0027d love to go back to college (to learn even more about poetry!), but college requires funds.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll be putting poems on a semi-regular basis. And for those who pledge, there will also be journal excerpts and such. Because I occasionally write something worthwhile in my journal.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, every little bit counts!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your consideration. Live long and prosper."
