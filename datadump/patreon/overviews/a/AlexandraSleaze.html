I\u0027d like to briefly introduce you to my story and all that jazz. I was born in a small town in Moldavia, Romania. Ever since I was little there was a bit of an artistic flare in me, having done 5 years of music lessons. At age 10 me and my family had to be moved to the big city, Bucharest, the capital city of Romania as my dad\u0027s job relocated. Fast forward a few years, and as the big city was more than I could chew (due to being bullied and not being able to find my place) I first found retouching and later on photography in doing self-portraits is an incredibly healing process.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFast forward even further as I don\u0027t want to bore you with all details, and I found myself enrolled in a media and entertainment course in The Netherlands. That\u0027s where I first started to work with models and it felt like I finally found myself and my place. Doing more and more of that opened my artistic horizons more than I could ever imagine and I found myself collaborating with someone absolutely amazing individuals! On the side of that I started my own music webzine called Metaloud where I was doing reviews and band interviews.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter a while, I once more relocated to Finland (I like to travel a lot), where I had always felt my heart belonged. Here I had to start over, find new models to work with, meet new creatives. Not only this, but due to Metaloud, I was able to also get immersed in doing concert photography, an area I have been dying to be a professional in for years! Growing with these things, I find myself nowadays dreaming of more elaborate shootings, with amazing props and fairytale like locations, and being able to get my name further in photography be it alternative or concert one. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately these things do not come cheap and I am not in a position where I can afford all these by myself. Having a job on the side is also delaying my progress in editing and creating more. I wish at least to make photography a part time job. Perhaps with your help and support I could end up living and just breathing photography! Thank you for your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eYou can find me here:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlternative Photography\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AlexandraSleazePhotography/\"\u003eFacebook\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alexandrasleaze.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alexandrasleazephoto/\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eConcert Photography\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://metaloud.com/\"\u003eMetaloud Website\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MetaloudOfficial/\"\u003eFacebook\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://metaloud.tumblr.com/\"\u003eTumblr\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alexandrasleaze.bigcartel.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSigned Prints\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
