    "summary": "Hello all! My name is Aleczander (known as Aleczandxr on the interwebs and AJ in real life) and I\u0027m a YouTuber that adores analyzing and taking apart my favourite fictional stories, whether they be in anime or video games. I\u0027m still a relatively small channel but I\u0027m probably known most for my videos on Hunter X Hunter, though I do tackle plenty of other stories as well. I\u0027m always playing new games and watching new shows in my spare time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started making videos on YouTube in the summer of 2016 just as an experimental hobby, but it grew into much more. At this point, I\u0027m enjoying the video-making process more than ever and hopefully my subscribers find something to enjoy as well. The simple fact that anyone watches my content and feels inclined to subscribe to me is humbling enough, and SO appreciated. But the fact of the matter is that I am a student in need of funds, and while I love doing these videos, it would be incredibly difficult to pay for tuition and other funds using the unsustainable and unpredictable resource of YouTube Adsense revenue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to treat YouTube as my part time job (and full time during breaks from school), and create as much content as I can. I want to work hard and pour my passion into my videos, but to maintain this on a regular basis I need a bit of support. The fact that you are even reading and are interested in my content is amazing support in itself, but if you can find it within yourself to become a Patron, that would absolutely mean the world to me and make a big difference in more than one way. Thanks very much for reading and taking an interest in my stuff, it means the world."

After 3 months of $20+/month patronage, you\u0027ll be able to request one video topic of your choice as long as it covers an anime I\u0027ve seen or a video game that I\u0027ve played, as long as it\u0027s within my scope, and as long as it isn\u0027t ridiculous. These requests can be as specific or general as you want. I can\u0027t guarantee that I\u0027ll get to the requests quickly, but I do guarantee that they will be done. Just a small way to show my appreciation.\u00a0\n\u003cp\u003eEDIT - I\u0027ve done 4 of these so far and I\u0027ve been proud of the results, but I\u0027m going to have to start being less liberal with the freedom of the requests now. If you reach the requirement and want to request a video topic, let me know. We can have a conversation about what you\u0027d like and hopefully we can come up with a topic you\u0027d enjoy.
