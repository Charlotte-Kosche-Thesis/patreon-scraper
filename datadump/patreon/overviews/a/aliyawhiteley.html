Your donation will also take me somewhere - it\u0027ll take me to the local caf\u00e9 where I can sit and write more stories and novels and weird things. If all goes well, maybe your donation can be put towards pen and notebook costs, since I\u0027m a longhand writer and I get through a lot of materials. Or even\u00a0towards attending events and conventions where I could get to thank you in person for funding my writing. That would be very cool.
