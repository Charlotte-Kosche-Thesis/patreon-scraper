Sculpting is my passion and sculpting in clay is my super passion. I am starting out on my journey to explore the beauty in emotions! I want to tackle the unwanted emotions in society such as, shame, depression, death, pain, loss, regret, etc... Seeing, first hand, the overwhelming number of people struggling with mental health issues is the drive behind this endeavor. Mental health has been such a taboo in the modern world that I feel it is time for it to be brought into the public view so that it can no longer be brushed aside. Mental health care is a grossly under-developed, under-funded, revolving system in America and yet society continues to stress the average person to the point of needing mental health care at some point in their lives. I wish to address this growing concern in my art work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Am I Working On?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMy current series of work is a set of Skull-ptures. Each skull is depicted as anatomical with paintings of flowers and spiraling patterns and dots. Sculpted flowers will be surrounding each skull in various ways. Each skull will be different. Each skull has a name and a story. Each story will be taking on a different mental health subject. The idea behind the stories is to show that, despite the things that these people struggled with in life, they were each loved and remembered. The flowers and painted patterns represent the love that the living still hold for the deceased. The fact that these people are no longer living represents the issue of mental health being ignored by society. The realism of the figures and flowers represents that this is a real problem and not a watered down version of reality. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eEach Skull Story will be released as I compete the skulls and present you the final skull-pture.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Am I Asking For Money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSculpting isn\u0027t cheap. For me to keep creating, I need money for supplies and money to eat and live. With Patreon you can help support my creation of fine art without investing huge sums of money. With your financial support, I can keep creating and pushing myself to break new barriers in sculpture as well as doing things like eating, and keeping the lights on.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Do You Get Out Of This?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a supporter you can have access to the part of art most people don\u0027t get to see. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e-Get good Karma by supporting the expression of art and bringing some beauty to the Universe!\u003cbr\u003e-Get images of what I\u0027m working on!\u003cbr\u003e-Watch time-lapse videos of art being created!\u003cbr\u003e-Get behind the scenes videos of the craziness that goes into the making of sculptures!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Get photo cards with the Skull Stories mailed to you!\u003cbr\u003e-Get exclusive sketches from my sketchbook!\u003cbr\u003e-Get mini-sculptures of your very own! \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJoin me in the struggles and accomplishments as I explore the concepts of a struggling mental health epidemic.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Are My Plans?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-I plan on releasing new content at least 4 times a month, hopefully more often as I get more support.\u003cbr\u003e-I plan on completing 13-24 skull-ptures for my current series.
