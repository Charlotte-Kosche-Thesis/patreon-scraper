    "summary": "As a professional downhill mountain bike racer and outspoken advocate of equality and diversity, I\u0027m a proponent of healthy, sustainable growth inside of cycling from every aspect. My content creation centers around increasing the accessibility of cycling to everyone, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation and beyond by directly challenging the way we look at the issues plaguing the bike industry. I provide free skills clinics to women, have funded race entries for beginner racers and continue to fight the sexism and racism that pervades cycling, as well as advocate for increased trails access and brain injury awareness. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy\u00a0goal is to\u00a0create more space for women and minorities in cycling as an athlete, a marketing professional, a coach and an open spaces proponent by building media that matters. I aim to give back to the sport that has given me so much as we march into a brighter, more progressive future and to do it on every level possible. From videos that highlight the best of the bike world, articles that challenge the status quo and social campaigns built around creating more space for more people on bikes, furthering the conversations inside of cycling sits at the core of what I do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery part of what I\u0027m involved with has been made possible by the people who believe in me, who continue to push me, to ask questions, give support and cheer me on... Without that, none of this would be possible. What you all have helped me achieve goes beyond race results or media spotlights and into the soul of the bike future that we\u0027re creating for coming generations. The media you\u0027ve helped me present, the questions you\u0027ve demanded answers to, the very heart of this industry-wide effort has been shaped by YOU and the very, very best of this amazing community. Thank you for believing in me and, most importantly, believing in the transformative power of two wheels.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
