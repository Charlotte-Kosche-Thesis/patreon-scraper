I\nlove stories with strong redemptive arcs and complex, shades-of-gray\ncharacters. My fiction usually includes some talking animals, lots of weird biology,\nand often some LGBT characters. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nIn 2008, I started podcasting my stories as\nserialized audio books. I solo-read the Prophet of Panamindorah trilogy, and you can still \n\u003ca href=\"http://podiobooks.com/title/the-prophet-of-panamindorah-book-i-fauns-and-filinians/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elisten to it on Podiobooks.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI became more ambitious\nwith my next series, The Guild of the Cowry Catchers. I produced those 5 books in\nfullcast audio, with forty voice actors, music and sound effects. I also commissioned illustrations for each podcast episode. My primary artist is \n\u003ca href=\"http://scloutier.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eSarah (Rah) Cloutier\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nCowry Catchers was labor-intensive, but\nrewarding. I got to work with talented voice actors and artists, and\nI built a wonderful group of fans. The project took 5 years and finished in\n2014. The whole series was released for free, and you can \n\u003ca href=\"http://podiobooks.com/title/the-guild-of-the-cowry-catchers-book-1-embers/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elisten to Cowry Catchers on Podiobooks.com.\u003c/a\u003e (Or search for it in iTunes.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhile I was doing all this, the ebook revolution\nhit. I learned to produce ebooks, paper books, hardback art books, and pro-level audio books for \u003ca href=\"http://www.audible.com/search/ref=a_pd_Sci-Fi_c2_1_auth?searchAuthor=Abigail+Hilton\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAudible.com.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy audience has been fantastic and encouraging. I have continued to work with my artist on\nillustrated projects. In May of 2015, we begun a semi-weekly (every other week) \u003ca href=\"http://www.abigailhilton.com/comic-1?tag=ProfessionalsFirstPage\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecomic. \u003c/a\u003eWe started with my short story \"Professionals\" before proceeding into Cowry Catchers. You can also see some of the many illustrations that Rah has created for my stories in numerous styles on \u003ca href=\"http://alhilton.tumblr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/abbiehilton/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePinterest. \u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon has made the comic possible. In 2016, I wrote a new short story every single month for the Patreon donors. I continued to do this through the first half of 2017. Around the middle of the year, I switched gears to get some books finished. I am still providing new fiction at least once a month, sometimes weekly, and there is a large backlog of stories available only to Patreon donors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do a weekly podcast on Patreon with an update about my life and a live reading of my newest work. I typically release one free episode each month, so you\u0027re welcome to follow, even if you can\u0027t donate. Enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e"
