We did learn that we don\u0027t want to travel the world by sailing. Now we are building a motorhome to explore the lands in a bit more comfort.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment we are looking for work, so if you know anyone looking for a Production Assistant or anyone looking for an entry level editor, I am very interested.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlso Ellipsis is for sale, we are trying to get $50,000 for her. Her value far exceeds that. We are taking a bit of a bath at that price so any serious offer near there will be entertained. There are many extras other than the new sails etc. Please visit our website at Sontru.com to view more about Ellipsis.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can contact us through any method you chose via any of the websites.\u00a0"

I hope to one day be able to finance myself through this site and continue to provide the content that I have been providing at a much more rapid pace, develop a charity, build some homes for the homeless, and maybe be the change I want to see in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the moment I enable the homeless population of Santa Cruz to have a voice by running a new youtube channel dedicated to telling the story they want to tell. I hope that by providing this information I am able to facilitate contacts, reconnect families, and eventually build into a charitable foundation that purchases land and makes shipping container homes available to any person who wants them free of charge, provide on site medical/mental/dental care, educate and hopefully get everyone the second chance they deserve.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe all have a story to tell, with your help we can give some of the more unfortunate the ability to do just that.\u00a0",
