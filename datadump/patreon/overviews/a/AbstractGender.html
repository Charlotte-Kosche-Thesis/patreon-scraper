However, with struggling time restraints, the work on the story has been helped up with only 1/3 of the epic completed. By supporting to Abstract Gender, you\u0027ll allow writer Rayne Shikama to focus all his time into writing the novel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyone who donates to the patreon will receive each chapter of the novel upon their completion, long before other people will be able to purchase the chapters on Amazon\u0027s direct publishing. The chapter will be in a word document so that anyone can read the story on their computer and not be limited to reading on a Kindle through Amazon.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreons will ill also be regularly updated about how Abstract Gender or any other writing projects Rayne is working on are going. Periodically, older chapters will be made available to the public, so even those who are not supporters of the project will eventually get to read the story as well."
