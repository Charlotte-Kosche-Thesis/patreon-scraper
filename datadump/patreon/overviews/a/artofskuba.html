I am a children\u0027s book illustrator, an SCBWI member, and alumna from Ringling College of Art and Design. I love to draw children-style illustrations, children\u0027s books, and anything cute! When I\u0027m not drawing for school, I am usually either doing freelance or drawing personal work for Behance, Instagram, and Facebook. I can draw most things, but my greatest passions are character designs, animals, plants, and whimsical illustrations. I love to inspire others and give them some sort of creative outlet, and my goal is to illustrate more children\u0027s books, whether it be full-time or on the side.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"font-weight: bold; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I use Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\"\u003eIt\u0027s an honor to study at such an esteemed school like Ringling, but it is also \u003cem\u003eextremely\u003c/em\u003e expensive. Along with paying off my loans for college tuition, I also need to pay for food and necessities. While my on-campus job and occasional freelance bring in some money, it\u0027s still tough to get by. Patreon is a way for me to work on personal art and for you to see the content I create while supporting me at the same time!

There are different amounts that you can pledge to support me, each with their own set of super cool rewards! Each tier has more rewards than the previous. If you want to pledge an amount that isn\u0027t listed, say, $8 or $22, then you would round down to the nearest tier.
