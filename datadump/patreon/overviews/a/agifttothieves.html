    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eSo far A Year of Self-Portraits has taken us on an incredible journey as it continues to surprise and delight us with its natural inclination and ability to push all boundaries of personal identity, medium and style while blurring the lines between Self and Other. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can be a part of the gentle, loving force that directs A Year of Self-Portraits on a path that honors and glorifies our beautiful stories as we connect to each other and our collective Self. Together we will find and open brand new doors through which our project\n can step and cross new thresholds of perception and connection.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHello! Welcome and thank you for joining me. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Natasha and I am the creator of \u003cstrong\u003eA Year of Self Portraits\u003c/strong\u003e, a project I started in September 2017 in which I committed myself to completing one self portrait every day for an entire year.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, this project, which I totally started on a whim just to prove I had the discipline and guts, has now turned into a full time job and that\u0027s almost entirely thanks to you because I made this project public and I immediately saw a response from you that made me feel connected, real and equipped to affect. Five months ago, I barely understood what I had started but as this project has developed to mean so much to me I\u0027ve realized that this is just what I need to do -- I need to make art for you, for me and for us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have loved engaging you with \u003cem\u003eA Year of Self Portraits\u003c/em\u003e and so I feel that now is the time to offer a way for you to support this project and engage in co-creation. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo here comes Patreon.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon offers a platform where creators such as myself and fans like you come together to make magic. Chiefly, you now have the opportunity to support \u003cem\u003eA Year of Self Portraits\u003c/em\u003e directly and ensure that I, as the creator, maintain access to resources and gain access to new and better quality materials and enrichment. Together, you and I can expand the very idea of self-portraiture, identity and art all while maintaining a trajectory to transcend medium and form. Exciting!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOkay, so the details. Previously, the structure of the project had me sharing every portrait, every day and while I could do this, the project was not my main focus. Now that I have refocused to devote my time and energy to \u003cem\u003eA Year of Self Portraits\u003c/em\u003e, I need a restructure that honors and sustains my natural rhythms for optimal work output because\u003cstrong\u003e I want to bring you the best of my ideas in the most engaging, dynamic and life-affirming art.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis winter, I discovered that my spirit and body most naturally align with the phases of the moon so I have designed a structure for sharing \u003cem\u003eA Year of Self Portraits\u003c/em\u003e with you that will ensure the best use of my energy and inspiration based on the 28-day moon cycle and it is as follows:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the \u003cstrong\u003eWaxing Moon\u003c/strong\u003e phase, the 14 days from new moon to full moon, all self-portraits will remain shared freely with the public.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring the following\u003cstrong\u003e Waning Moon\u003c/strong\u003e phase, the 14 days from full moon to new moon, all portraits will be shared privately with project patrons based on their rewards tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo that\u0027s it for now! I look forward to engaging you in this dialogue as we continue to journey forth into this new phase.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope you have fun getting to know Patreon if you\u0027re new here. If you need any help figuring things out, there are lots of resources, like a FAQ, available through Patreon itself at the bottom of this page. I also want you to feel free to message me with your project-related questions. I will gladly provide responsive help to ensure you have the patron experience you want and need.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, let\u0027s do this thing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThank you so much for checking out my Patreon and supporting A Year of Self Portraits. I understand that financial support is just not available to offer for everyone. I want you to know that I appreciate you so, so much regardless of your level of financial help you offer. Every like, comment and share fills me with so much gratitude. I am amazed any time you talk about my work because in that moment, I know I\u0027m doing exactly what I need to do. Because of YOU! Thank you! \u0026lt;3\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
