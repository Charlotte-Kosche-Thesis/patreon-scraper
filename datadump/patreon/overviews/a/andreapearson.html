    "summary": "Hi, everyone! My name is Andrea Pearson, and I\u0027m an author of bestselling fantasy and clean romance. I\u0027m an avid reader and outdoor enthusiast (which means I love being outside... I\u0027m not very extreme, though). I play several instruments, not including the banjo, and I love putting together musical arrangements. My favorite sports are basketball and football... mainly basketball. :-) I\u0027ve had several knee surgeries, though, and I\u0027m VERY uncoordinated... so I don\u0027t play sports. Just watch them. :-)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI graduated from BYU with a bachelor of science degree in Communications Disorders. (Basically, the science behind why we struggle to communicate: hearing, speech, etc.) I\u0027ve published over 35 novels, a bunch of novellas and short stories, and I\u0027ve been invited to teach at conferences, conventions, and on podcasts numerous times about being successful at publishing. I\u0027m very passionate about it, and I absolutely love teaching others how to turn their dreams into realities.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m always in the mood for a good movie (check out my Self-Publish Strong podcast - my husband and I discuss movies as part of good writing. If you love movies, you\u0027ll enjoy it). I love thunderstorms, the ocean, hiking, public speaking, painting, traveling, and spending every spare minute with my husband and kids. We live\u00a0in a beautiful little valley surrounded by hills with our sweet children.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy have I created a Patreon page? To help us keep the lights on. Not stressing about money leaves my brain free to focus on what my readers love best: writing books for them to devour. It\u0027s a way for readers to say thanks and get a little extra back that they wouldn\u0027t get otherwise.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you so much for supporting us in this endeavor!\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eP.S. For those who read my romances and not my fantasies, an Arete is a magical person in my Mosaic Chronicles universe. :-)\u003cbr\u003e"

When we reach $2,500 a month, my family and I will travel to Alaska and I\u0027ll show you where Agnes lives in Petersville and where the tunnel to Mount Koven begins. I can\u0027t wait! Please help me make it happen!",
