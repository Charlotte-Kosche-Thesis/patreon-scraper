    "summary": "My name is Anthony Rowsick and I love music. I am an amateur musician and have been a fan of progressive rock in particular for more years than I care to admit. A few years back a friend who does a podcast suggested that I start podcasting and, being an empty-nester who suddenly found himself with too much time on his hands, I decided to give it a go. I started a podcast on progressive rock music called Prog-Watch. Fast forward a few years and the show has become more successful than I would have imagined when I started. I\u0027m on three internet radio networks and have spoken to some really big names in my favorite genre of music. I have built a pretty nice website, and I get at least a few emails each month from folks who like my show, which really warms my heart!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe sad part of the story is that being on internet radio really doesn\u0027t pay, and I do incur costs associated with computer and studio equipment, web hosting, and keeping track of listener trends, all to make Prog-Watch better and better. In an effort to take things to that proverbial next level, I am here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you have found my page here, you have probably listened to my show and (hopefully) liked it. If you do like it, does it have some value to you? If it does, I am willing to give you access to some exclusives. At Tier One you will get access to an ad-free, higher-quality mp3 version of the show than you can either hear on internet radio or download from my website. And since the show is about music, who wouldn\u0027t want a higher quality, less compressed listening experience? At Tier Two you get Tier One access PLUS access to all of the interviews I have conducted with progressive rock artists, in their entirety. I have conducted more than 25 such interviews, with big names such as Jordan Rudess of Dream Theater, John Lodge of The Moody Blues, Roine Stolt of The Flower Kings, Neal Morse of Spock\u0027s Beard, and Geoff Downes of The Buggles, Asia, and Yes. With Tier Two access you can hear everything we talked about, which is typically much more than was presented as part of the show.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e"
