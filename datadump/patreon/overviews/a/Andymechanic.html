I initially started uploading workshop task type videos for my students to use as part of their \u0027e-learning\u0027 aspects of their course when I worked as an Automotive Lecturer at Unitec in Auckland, New Zealand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese videos gave the students\u00a024/7 access to some really useful information.\n\nI run my own small workshop too and actively undertake a wide range of workshop jobs. The content of the channel has grown due to requests and the various repair jobs that come in. Presently I see the channel developing to becoming a useful resource for students, DIY mechanics and just about anyone who fixes, tinkers or generally is keen to have a go and fix their vehicle themselves...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nSome videos cover really basic tasks like changing a bulb, others complete engine rebuilds. If you can\u0027t find a video covering what your looking for then just ask...\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nAndy Mechanic...\nPo.Box 6265, Wellesley Street, Auckland, New Zealand 1141"
