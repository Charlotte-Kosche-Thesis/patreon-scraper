Through your support, you are helping me find further intensive to create such awesome works, get that meaningful interaction that means so much to me, and helps me not have to work jobs that aren\u0027t as colorful and wonderful as painting pretty paintings of burlesque beauties and further establishing myself as a model and a performer. \u00a0By helping me as a creative, you fill my heart, and I get to fill you with art!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began my art career while living in my hometown of Janesville, Wi. In 2013 I received my BFA in Drawing and Painting from UW-Milwaukee, Peck School of Arts. After, I moved to South Bend, In to work on several mural projects and continue my own studio practice. It was in Indiana that I began performing burlesque with the disDress Dolls and began modeling and interacting in the pinup community in the area. In May of 2016 I moved the the Austin, Tx area and continue my pursuit of my passions and furthering my art.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy art has been showing in Milwaukee, Indianapolis, Detroit, Richmond, and many other cities. My largest upcoming show will be featured in January 2017 in Buchannon, Mi and will feature a large body of oil paintings that showcase burlesque and sideshow performers that I know and work with. My burlesque performances have been seen in Milwaukee, South Bend, Indianapolis, and soon in Austin. I am continuing to work as an independant burlesque performer. My modeling has been featured in Delicious Dolls Magazine, Urban Pirates Pinups, and will be featured in several other upcoming editions of magazines.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWould you like to see specific content?
