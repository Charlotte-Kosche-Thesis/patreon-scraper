    "summary": "Hi. My name is Amethyst and I live, breathe and dream video games.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was six when I first got into them, but even back then I enjoyed designing Fakemon and drawing custom Zelda maps as much as I loved playing. When I was eight, I drew various puzzle mazes on notepads for my friends to solve during class, and began taking private development lessons after school. When I was ten I began working on my own projects, and when I was eleven I found RPG Maker and ceased to willingly leave my room ever.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFourteen years later and I am \u003cem\u003eincredibly\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0blessed to have such a wonderful following supporting me and my projects. Though there is still much to do even on my current active ones, I would like nothing more than to keep making games for you all well and far into the future.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut I cannot do that alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe hard hand of reality is ever knocking at my door, and unfortunately living (especially in my city) is not cheap, and games take a long time to make. I was working a night job to do it before, but my company closed down, and so in order to keep my development strong, I was forced to look elsewhere.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEnter Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a crowdfunding platform that allows users to pledge a monthly donation to creators such as myself, and thus allows us to live month to month. You can choose or change how much you give at any time, and in return you get the backstage pass, to have your name in the stars, and many other perks. Check the list to the right for the full details of reward tiers I\u0027m offering.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to everyone\u0027s support, I\u0027m at a place where I can reliably keep working on development full time. But it\u0027s still a long road ahead, and the cost of living is ever unsteady, threatening to bear down and rip it away. I will fight tooth and nail to keep making games for you, but I need your help.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, what kind of projects have I got going on right now? I\u0027m glad you let me ask for you-- I\u0027ve got three:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eA certain fangame which I must naturally be a bit shy about on this public page for reasons I hope you may understand.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rebornevo.com/index.php?/sd/index.html/\"\u003eStarlight Divide, a tactical RPG/rhythm hybrid game about the worlds of Heaven and Hell after God has abandoned them.\u003c/a\u003e \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.rebornevo.com/index.php?/dptg/index.html/\"\u003eA third, quieter project\u003c/a\u003e that is currently announced only to my Patrons ^~^\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether two people choose to support me here, or two hundred do, I will be making these. Frankly, it is impossible for me not to. But your support-- even if it is just one dollar a month-- can make a huge difference in \u003cem\u003ehow\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0these are made.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease stand by me, and help me create a True Ending future.\u003cbr\u003eThank you, with all my glitched and flickering heart.\u003cbr\u003e\u0026lt;\u0338\u03153\u0489\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
