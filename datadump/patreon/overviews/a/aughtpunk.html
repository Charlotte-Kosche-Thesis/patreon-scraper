    "summary": "My name is Amber Freeman (writing as A. A. Freeman), and I have written\u003cem\u003e Echo of the Larkspur\u003c/em\u003e,\n a sci-fi story complete at 103k words. The book features a diverse cast\n of genders, ethnicity, and multiple LBGTQA relationships, including the \nmain male lead and the male robot who loves him. My novel can be read as\n a stand-alone but is part one of a planned four part series. At this \ntime I have finished the first draft of book two, \u003cem\u003eCry of the Hawthorn\u003c/em\u003e, and have book three and four roughly outlined. However the path to getting published isn\u0027t an easy one, and that\u0027s where I need your help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough my first book is finished there is so much more that needs to be done. I need a line editor, a cover if I go the self-publishing route, and extra funds for promotions. With your help I can put \u003cem\u003eEcho of the Larkspur\u003c/em\u003e and the following books out for the world to enjoy. Even a dollar a month will help me and my army of smooching robots in the long run.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose who donate can get everything from their names in my acknowledgements, short ficlets, advanced readings of my online work and maybe even a dumb MSPaint drawing done by me!\u003cbr\u003e"
