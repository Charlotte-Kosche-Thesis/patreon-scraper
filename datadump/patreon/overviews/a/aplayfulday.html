    "summary": "\u003cem\u003eUpdated since recording this video: I now know what the *thing* I want to create is! I\u0027ll be self publishing a collection of essays in December 2018. Each Patreon supporter will get their digital copy before general release in early 2019.\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA Playful Day is a space to\u00a0document those moments we wish to tell stories about. The A Playful Day podcast makes visible those moments in every day life that define and shape us. In each fortnightly episode, I feature conversations with special guests that reflect on their passions, motivations and identity. On the blog, I try to tether these elements together, either writing about my own experiences, or hosting other voices that deserve to be heard too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFrom the very start, A Playful Day has been about making all of life\u0027s moments visible and living for the ones you want to tell stories about. If we could sit and share coffee for an hour together, A Playful Day might be what it feels like.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow things currently work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI (Kate) currently host all things A Playful Day. I produce a podcast with a little help at the end point from my producer who cleans up audio and a transcriber who keeps things accessible for all. I juggle this around freelance work as a writer and photographer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI use a combination of Patreon and donations to fund the time and resources that it takes to make A Playful Day content. From an early stage, I chose not to use heavy advertising on the podcast, the blog or on any social media. For me, I found it interfered with the experience and was distracting so I\u0027d like to use Patreon to keep everything at A Playful Day advertisement free. That includes social media.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow I\u0027d like things to work:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d basically like A Playful Day to become a safe space around which we can gather for live interviews, real life events, publications and regular podcasts and blog posts.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also want to self publish a regular body of work. I\u0027ve started this journey by committing to self publish a Collection of Essays with original photography in December 2018. I hope to pursue other publishing options and self publish regularly and in doing so, maintain my commitment to raising visibility for marginalised communities and topics of conversation. Until I can afford to pay myself and cover all costs, I can\u0027t build that dream.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Two Tier System:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that asking people to contribute monthly can really affect your budget. With this in mind I\u0027ve created a pledge system that reflects the A Playful Day philosophy: all of us can contribute at a level we know we can manage right now. So you will find extra content gated at the lower end of the scale with the view that the more of us pledging, the more fun these options are as we are creating together. However, if you\u0027re happy and able to contribute more, you can pay directly for a service each month that keeps A Playful Day viable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I will use the money for:\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now, I\u0027d like to meet a goal of $1400 per month. Meeting the current goal would insure the fortnightly podcast is a readily accessible option for as many people as possible.\u00a0It would mean that everyone who is involved in that process is paid as they should be.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI pay everyone else before I pay myself. This is a bottom line for work on A Playful Day- pay contributors and collaborators for their time. Achieving this goal would mean I also get paid for my time to produce and write on Patreon- I wouldn\u0027t need to find freelance work to pay for the costs outlined below.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003eA Playful Day Monthly Costs:\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHosting fees- These get particularly costly when a surge of new people find the pdocast and blog. This is good news but it often means more fees! I\u0027d like a more robust set up that covers these fun new followings.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eProducer- Patrick is my sound wizard and keeps the podcast sounding crisp. I\u0027d like to pay Patrick the fee he deserves and I\u0027m almost certain that Patrick would like me to pay him the fee he deserves too!\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTranscription- This has been a regular request since I began the podcast and I\u0027ve now employed magical Penny to do this to ensure access for every person who wants to access the conversations we are having on the podcast.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSoftware \u0026amp; licensing\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMailchimp \u0026amp; Social Media- Numbers matter when you have a Patreon audience helping you reach these goes and keeping them informed, managing lists and occasional promotions makes it easier to get everyone aware of what\u0027s going on at A Playful Day. I\u0027d like to plan in so that any growth, once again, doesn\u0027t cause sudden costs.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMy time- I\u0027d like to make this a day job and pay myself for the time it takes to research, interview, compile and promote. Paying bills is a pretty good start to sustainable growth.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eThat\u0027s the basics. With these all covered, A Playful Day can support itself and keep going for a long time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you to each of you who pledge to keep things accessible for all of our community and make every person feel seen as we explore different perspectives in life. It means so much to know we are building this together."
