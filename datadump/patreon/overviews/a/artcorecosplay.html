    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3MAyoYe.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Elli, I\u0027m from Germany and I\u0027m creating Cosplays since 2014.\u003cbr\u003eTo be honest, Cosplay was probably the one thing I always wanted to do even when I didn\u0027t know it existed. When I was a little kid I LOVED dressing up for carnival and halloween, I always wanted to have the coolest costume. \u003cbr\u003eSadly, back then it wasn\u0027t possible for me and even though I wanted to learn it earlier, I only learned the basics of sewing at the age of 15. In the meantime I had spent my time putting together weird witches for halloween or princesses with daggers for carnival. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first had a glimpse at games at a friends house, while she was playing on her Nintendo DS I was instantly fascinated. This led to me always wanting to play a game when I visited friends and they had a console, no matter of which kind, because I didn\u0027t have anything to play games with at home. Most of my friends didn\u0027t understand why.\u003cbr\u003eI spent the years using my rare time on the internet playing browser games and later fell in love with my very first MMORPG. When I was allowed to spend more time on the internet (well, technically I wasn\u0027t but I still did it) I got into more and more MMO\u0027s and later League of Legends. It was when I turned 15 I think when I got my Dad\u0027s Laptop for Christmas. It was around that time when I bought my first game: Skyrim. And that\u0027s the beginning of a love story that lasted about 700 hours until now, and it\u0027s still going. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, as you can see I always loved costumes and I always loved games. I had a time when I was very infested with anime as well, and that\u0027s what brought me to this fantastic hobby named \"Cosplay\". \u003cbr\u003eI still do Anime Cosplays now and then but most of the costumes I still want to do are from games.\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, time went on, I bought my first PC (after I fried the laptop with too much Skryrim), a pretty decent piece of hardware a friend built for me and it opened a whole new world to me! \u003cbr\u003eI am now addicted to not only Skyrim but also The Witcher Series, Dark Souls, Dragon Age, Tomb Raider, Borderlands, Devil may Cry and COUNTLESS more! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3WEmSbm.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDuring that time I also improved my cosplay skills and equipment with the help of my parents and lately a few very generous people on the internet. I started off with a very basic sewing machine that I still use today, a dull knife and a dull pair of scissors. \u003cbr\u003eI knew little about the craft, what I knew I learned through the internet and what I wanted to know I learned through the internet as well. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve come a long way since then but I always strive to improve my skills and the quality of my costumes. About 95% of my stuff is self made, but of course I have to buy some things which I can\u0027t make myself or I simply buy them because it\u0027s easier. \u003cbr\u003eTo me, Cosplay is crafting, sewing, glueing and a bit of crying. You work hard on a costume, you put your blood, sweat and your very soul into it and in the end you get something completely unique and perfect for you.\u003cbr\u003eApart from that, Cosplay is friends and fun. Be it at a convention, a photoshoot or crafting group - it\u0027s about having fun and working on your skills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s what Cosplay is to me. To someone else, the craftsmanship part might not be that important, and that\u0027s fine as well.\u003cbr\u003eAnother important part of this hobby is being proud of yourself. I\u0027ve made the experience that not only on the internet people are just really cruel. No matter the reasons, I\u0027m sick of it and I will no longer let myself be limited by what others might think of me.\u003cbr\u003eI am proud to be who I am and I\u0027m proud to show it. I might not be perfect, but I\u0027m working on it.\u003cbr\u003eIn the end, we\u0027re all nerds in costumes, trying to be ourselves by being someone else.\u003cbr\u003eLOVE EACH OTHER. \u003cbr\u003eHAVE FUN.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/3PD4npq.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI feel like I needed a new way for my followers and me to mutually benefit from each other. \u003cbr\u003eWhile some social media pages have become less and less supportive \ntowards artists and creators Patreon seems to be a suitable alternative. For an amount that you can choose yourself you can support me and in return you get exclusive previews, videos, work in progress and you\u0027re the first to see the results from photoshootings. Best thing is, no crooked algorithm prevents you from seeing my postings and I can be sure that everyone here is really interested in my work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ssWljp1.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI will keep the content mostly Cosplay related but now and then some of my own Artworks, Fashion- and/or Modeling Photoshoots, Gaming related stuff or other DIY stuff might sneak in. \u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not a professional, but I take my Cosplay very seriously. \u003cbr\u003eI will get more into making tutorials and very detailed progress photos that will be posted first here on Patreon. You can also expect behind the scenes videos and preview videos. It might also happen that I ask for your opinion on which costume to make next.\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to create a friendly and familiar atmosphere for everyone despite the fact that you have to pay to see the content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/w89vQXe.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
