    "summary": "Hey, my name is Marcus Delekta, otherwise known as Catloaf (and a couple other names), and I\u0027m the developer of Above \u0026amp; Below.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI started the framework for this game in 2012 based off a scrapped game called Project Orionis. As a huge fan of the Tales series and other old 2D RPGs, I knew that my ultimate goal was to build a game that fellow RPG fans would love. Ever since starting consistent development on the current iteration of the game back in February 2016, I knew I was working on something that wasn\u0027t just \"another RPGMaker game\". Above \u0026amp; Below prominently features a linear motion battle system, something only seen in the three Tales games currently on Steam. When working with a currently untapped niche, something that sounds great on paper and inside your head may not translate the way you want it to in gameplay. My main goal is to develop a community around the game and working with the community to make the release an amazing indie RPG that fans want to pick up and try out.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more specifics of the game on either\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/above-below-demo-v1-3-active.68586/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethis forum thread\u003c/a\u003e or my development blog over on Tumblr:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aboveandbelowgame.tumblr.com/\"\u003ehttp://aboveandbelowgame.tumblr.com\u003c/a\u003e/.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\nUnlike Kickstarter, there\u0027s no penalties if a goal isn\u0027t met for a project. With Patreon, you also have the option to consistently support the project if you wish. With your direct support, I am able to create something that RPG gamers alike will enjoy.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat will the money go towards?\u003c/h4\u003e\nAll of the money goes towards the game, more specifically the main costs are: LMBS battlers, character portraits, new UI, custom assets, and perhaps even an original soundtrack!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhat do I get in return?\u003c/h4\u003eAll Patreons pledging $1 or more get access to all current and previous behind the scenes dev updates, early looks at game updates, and special RPGMaker tutorials from yours truly. They\u0027ll also be listed under the Patrons section in the credits and have their name and a special message listed on a tombstone in Twin Pines Cemetery.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eSounds good, anything else?\u003c/h4\u003eThank you, just, from the bottom of my heart, thank you. With your help I\u0027ll be able to make this project a finished reality and I cannot thank you enough for that."
