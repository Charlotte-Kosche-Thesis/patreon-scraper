After being, \"stuck\" for nearly 20 years - completely paralyzed by fear... a near fatal car accident destroyed the idea of, \"stability\" - I jumped in with both feet and decided that it was my calling in life to make the world a better place.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past few months, I have been HUMBLED at the response that I have received as I have shared my story and as I have pursued my own dream as the violinist for The Musical Mountaineers. Each day is a gift, and having the opportunity to share this journey with so many people - and especially being able to help others find their own path - has been the most beautiful adventure of my life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1zRC5p-IjSE\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou are enough.
