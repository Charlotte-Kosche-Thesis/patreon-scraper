    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi there, My name is Alf Herigstad\u003c/strong\u003e, thanks for checking out my Patreon page.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am\u00a0a lifelong entrepreneur in four different industries; Construction, fitness, transportation, real estate, and now\u2026as host of the Being A Better Man podcast. I am a former boxer, a Veteran of the Army, a farmer, a reality TV personality in Norway, a father of three and grandfather of nine.  All of my life experience has culminated into a driving passion to now share the things I have learned with the rest of the world, particularly with other men. My primary message; be a better man today, than you were yesterday\u2026.and then keep doing that every day until you die. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking this podcast was a bit of an experiment\u2026in the beginning, \u00a0I launched it January 22nd, 2016, it has turned out to be so much more. Even better, I\u2019ve heard from a lot of people who really love it.  I\u2019ve gotten letters from people as young as 16 and as old as 52 telling me that the show has helped them some way in their life.  That is SO awesome! That is exactly why I\u2019m doing this, to help guys make the choice to be a better man today than they were yesterday.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI decided I want to keep making this happen, because\u2026When a bunch of guys decide to be better men something happens;  the world becomes a better place.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eThere are a few ways I can continue to make this happen. One would be to join a podcast network and lose some control over how things are done. Another would be to sell advertising on the show, you know...commercials.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eBut I don\u2019t really want to do either of those. People seem to like that the episodes are short and contained, to the point, not a lot of extra jibber-jabber, and I like that too.  I don\u0027t want to mess that up with a bunch of extra stuff. \u00a0Though I may have to in the short term, we\u0027ll see.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now it\u0027s just me and you guys, a community of listeners, figuring this thing out together. I\u2019d like to keep it that way for as long as I can.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe bottom line is, I\u0027ve been running this out of pocket since I started\u2026I do actually have to eat, and pay bills and stuff, just like you, plus the expenses of producing the show. \u00a0I\u2019m hoping to figure out a way to NOT have to spend all my time working somewhere else\u2026because then the show suffers.  That\u2019s why we are here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you enjoy the show, if you get value out of it and believe the world needs it, I hope you\u0027ll contribute. I want to be a bright spot in your day, three times a week, and hope you\u0027ll find enough value in that to support Being A Better Man.  Heck\u2026if I have more time I will be able to make it more than three a week.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ve tried to put together some fun extras for those of you that do decide to lend a hand. You can check them out over on the right. \u00a0They will probably change and get more stuff added to them as time goes on, we are just getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eSo if you haven\u2019t, give the show a listen. If you like it, tell your friends about it. And if you can, please consider donating to help keep it going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you,\u003cbr\u003eAlf Herigstad\u003cbr\u003e"

My name is Alf Herigstad, I\u0027m the host and creator of this podcast.  I\u0027m on a personal mission to be a better man today, than I was yesterday...and keep doing that until I die. Thats the mission I am inviting my listeners to join me on.  Just listening won\u0027t make you a better man...but it will keep that idea in the upper levels of your consciousness, so that you can take charge of your own life and become better than you were yesterday.",
