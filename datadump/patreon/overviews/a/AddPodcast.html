A.D.D. host Jason @BARRR will also be creating original mixed media paintings for each episode and available as bonus Patreon member gifts (for larger donors.) In the grand scheme of things this will help defer the huge time consuming cost of booking, research, equipment maintenance and upgrades, art and graphic design, social media output and maintaining our Patreon, AND paying the cast/producer. As it stands now, Jason Barr is booking, hosting, social media, managing sponsorships \u0026amp; billing, designing \u0026amp; producing prints AND tees for our Patreon pals and making original art fore each episode. This takes at least 3/4 days a week to juggle all of this. If you can help us get here it\u0027ll make this so much smoother to spread the responsibilities out among the current crew. We\u0027re not asking for a lot, but we\u0027re willing to keep giving you our time \u0026amp; a FREE stinkin podcast that helps the coolest artists, musician and entrepreneurs we know. We\u0027re exporting the best artist from the mid-west to the world and importing some very important people back here to Lawrence, KS! Thanks for considering this.\u00a0",

     "description": "We are building a small studio in the basement of the current \u00a0North Lawrence location. As of now we need roughly $400 for an older Mac Mini that will connect with the equipment already provided by our main sponsor P.I. INTL. We also need a new headphone amp and new headphones (4 of them.) Thanks to P.I. INTL. our four SM-58 mics have been purchased. BUT we need a ($250/300) SURE SB vocal mic for our host Jason Barr. P.I. INTL. also purchased us a 4 channel audio interface for our Pro-Tools rack. We really need an 8 channel rack to get all mics, samplers, and headphones plugged in. Willing to trade our smaller rack for a larger one or will sell it to you if you\u0027re looking so we can upgrade. $1000 should get us the base equipment that will allow us to continue providing crystal clear audio quality which has helped elevate the A.D.D. Podcast to a higher level. The A.D.D. studio will also be used to record bands from the KC metro and touring bands. These recordings will be made available on tape cassette, as a bonus podcast and as a higher quality digital download for our Patreon donors! \u00a0",
