    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE 1/31: \u003c/strong\u003eSee my most recent post about cancelling the podcast. I\u0027ll only be blogging as I focus on my dissertation. However, I do hope to start a new science communication podcast soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for visiting my Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI already write all sorts of articles on my blog\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/accordingtomatthew/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eAccording to Matthew\u003c/a\u003e where I\u00a0cover topics about social justice to politics to science. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow I am hoping to create a podcast where we will also cover similarly broad topics and interview a variety of guests.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/accordingtomatthew/tag/patrick-anderson/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ePatrick Anderson\u003c/a\u003e will be my co-host and one area of emphasis will be interviewing researchers and activists to learn about their work. We\u0027ll talk to scientists in a variety of fields from rocket scientists to sociologists as well as political and social justice activists. I will also talk about my own research area, social psychology, including my main research focus,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/accordingtomatthew/2016/08/the-science-of-why-we-reject-science-and-what-we-can-do-about-it/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ethe psychology of why people reject scientific evidence.\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother emphasis of the show will be having dialogue with people we disagree with. Patrick and I are both nonreligious liberals, so we will be talking to conservatives, Christians, libertarians, and anyone else who has a different ideology from us. The goal is to have civil conversations with those of different ideologies in hopes of finding common ground, learning from each other, and reducing polarization.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do you know what you\u0027re talking about? \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eI write a lot about science, so you might be relieved to know that I actually am\u00a0working on my PhD in social psychology and have been published in psychology, sociology, and neuroscience journals.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/accordingtomatthew/2015/11/no-atheist-kids-are-not-more-altruistic-than-religious-kids/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eWe all get annoyed by sloppy science journalism\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eso my academic background helps me write about science accurately, while keeping it to the point. My scientific background will help me interview different scientists I bring on the show.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love doing academic research, but I also spend a lot of time doing activism work. Specifically, I\u0027ve focused on gender equality and sexual violence prevention activism.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://appliedsentience.com/2015/07/23/three-things-i-learned-about-politics-from-providing-scientific-testimony/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eI\u0027ve also dabbled with local politics\u00a0\u003c/a\u003eduring my time as Co-Chair of the Secular Coalition of South Carolina. I feel like my scientist and activist lives give me a unique perspective in my writing that not many other people have.\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.matthewfacciani.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eVisit my website to see more of the work I\u0027ve been doing!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSo why should I give you money?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWell, because you want to! Maybe you share some of the same interests as I do. Maybe you like my writing and want to help me create the podcast. Maybe you agree that it would be nice to see more people engage in dialogue with those who don\u0027t always agree with them. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a grad student, I\u0027m perpetually broke. I\u0027ve already had a few close calls from random expenses and medical bills so even a few extra dollars would go a long way for my living expenses. And if I\u0027m less stressed out about paying my bills, I can write more and create more podcasts! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFinally, as my Patreon, you will have special access to my work through the Patreon\u0027s only feed and I can take your suggestions on what I should write or talk about next!\u003cbr\u003e"
