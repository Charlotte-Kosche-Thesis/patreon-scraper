This ups the quality of the work creators are able to produce by feeding them and keeping them warm so they don\u0027t have to roam the streets looking for work elsewhere.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo If you like the work I do and want to help me focus on it full time then this is the place for you!\u003cbr\u003eMy VGM songs are always going to be available to view on youtube anyway, so if you are unable to be a patron, don\u0027t worry, you will still be able to see the VGM goodness coming your way :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eWhere your money goes:\u003c/h3\u003eRight now, I am a 1 man band, and not just that....I\u0027m a 1 man production house as well. Which means I do everything, write \u0026amp; record songs, focus the camera (which is pretty hard when you need to be standing in front of it), edit the videos, design and animate. + I also have to do the dishwasher like all the time, which is nuts! where do these plates keep coming from!?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour money will be going towards making my work system smoother. Finally get some insulation so recordings can sound silky smooth, get a camera that can auto-focus quietly etc. Down the line I would like to be able to rent out an actual recording space so I don\u0027t have to re-record a perfect take because a dog outside my window decided it was time to bark at LITERALLY NOTHING!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUltimately I would like to be able to sustain my wife and I so she can also pursue her dream of making art too! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDo I have to pay in US Dollars?\u003c/strong\u003e NO - Pay in any currency! As this is US based website, everything is written in Dollars, but you can use any currency and it will be automatically converted.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow many music videos will you release a month?\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003eAround two (max four) videos every month. Maybe more, maybe less. Don\u0027t worry though, as you can set a monthly maximum when you sign up so that you never donate more that you can afford. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI don\u0027t have much money, can I still become a Patron?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes, please only sign up to donate what you can easily afford. Even $1 per music video I upload will make a huge difference and would be greatly appreciated. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCan I stop donating in the future if I can\u0027t afford it?\u003c/strong\u003e Yes of course! If you can\u0027t afford to donate in the future, or you need to donate less that\u0027s absolutely fine. You can just log in to change or cancel the account whenever you want. Don\u0027t worry I\u0027ll still leave up that metaphorical gold star sticker ;)\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
