    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHi, and welcome to my Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Alethea Cheng Fitzpatrick, and for the past couple of years, I\u0027ve been speaking up more and more about diversity, inclusion, gender, and specifically race, mostly on my private Facebook feed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBorn and brought up in the UK, of Chinese descent, I\u0027ve lived my entire adult life in the US, here in New York City, the city I fell in love with when I first came here when I was 18 years old.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving trained and worked as an architect, I started my own family photography business when I became a mom in 2009, which morphed into a photography coaching business, and I am now focusing on \u003cstrong\u003ewomen\u0027s leadership and team development\u003c/strong\u003e. My mission is to help companies and organizations cultivate women as leaders through inclusive models of leadership that will make the world a better place for all. I help leaders and teams align with their values and what naturally energizes them in order to do their best work without sacrificing themselves or others in the process. You can find out more about my work at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aletheafitzpatrick.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehttp://aletheafitzpatrick.com\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve long been passionate about supporting women. As a mother of two boys, I believe this is how I can best contribute to making the world a better place for them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, the experience of being usually the only, or one of only a few, non-white faces in the room (virtual or otherwise) is one I am only just starting to process and talk about. For me, the tipping point was in July 2016 with the murder of Philando Castile by a police officer, in front of his girlfriend and her 4-year-old daughter. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI realized I could no longer be silent. I had to speak up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI started posting, mostly on Facebook, and the experience of doing so has been both difficult and rewarding. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not white, but I\u0027m not black. I\u0027m aware of the tremendous privilege I have, while also coming to terms with the ways in which my experience is not the same as those with either lighter or darker skin than mine. How I navigate this is a work-in-progress. It has been and will continue to be uncomfortable and imperfect. I do my best to do no harm, but I have and will continue to fall short at times. I have no choice but to be ok with that because otherwise there is no way forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve decided to\u00a0start a page here at Patreon because a) Facebook is not a good platform for long-form content, nor is it easy to access archives and b) I had started a Medium blog for this purpose but found I am not quite ready to write on these issues in a completely public form and c) I would like to get paid for this work.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have included my Facebook posts on these topics from July 2016 up until now in the Patreon archives, accessible to all Patrons. You\u0027ll see the evolution of my voice, and it is still a work in progress.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that in my journey, still ongoing, towards speaking up, depending on your own background and history with these issues, you might learn something new, gain a new perspective, find resonance in your own story, be motivated to speak up and/or take action in your own life, or be inspired by how your leadership can make a difference and encourage others like me to speak up. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt the very least, whatever your background or identity, I hope you will know that you are not alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome of you are way ahead of me on this journey. Some of you are just getting started.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI invite you to join me in this experiment, and I appreciate your support at whatever level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNote: this page launched on November 8th, 2017 (yes, one year after the election). The first 20 Patrons at the $10 level or more will receive a welcome postcard designed by me and sent via snail-mail with a personal handwritten note!\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/aletheafitzpatrick\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYou can also make a one-time contribution via Paypal.\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
