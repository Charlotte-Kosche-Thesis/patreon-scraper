We\u0027re excited to get to know our fans, especially on a much closer and more personal level from that of a pledge.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo without further ado...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWho is Alt F Four Gaming?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there, my name is Adam John Brown, you may know me better as the chap primarily behind the camera and doing all the editing here at Alt F Four, I am a 30 year old (as of 2017) student who is studying psychotherapy and counselling, in my free time I make YouTube videos. At heart I am a video gamer first, I love them passionately and want to share my, and other people\u0027s experiences with you. Whether that is from other members of the gaming group such as Foster when we first published our videos from\u00a0Oct 21, 2016, to more recently with Lewis my housemate, and even more recently the collaborations.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy support us?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWhen it comes to making a YouTube video, the main thing required is time. It can take anywhere from 4-10 hours for some videos depending on the content. From first recording the video, to post processing the audio of the microphone, processing the facecam for a higher quality video, editing the video itself with cuts/volume adjustments, packaging it all together and doing a final render, even the thumbnails themselves require images from in game, nice text and a good eye for details. Finally uploading the actual video itself and doing the finishing touches.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHow would your donation help? Well the more money we make the more types of content we can produce and more importantly the \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003emore time\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0we are able to have. If we, as a group, can make ends meet from making videos, then that means we can spend more time doing what we love - making more videos! For you, our audience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cstrong\u003eBut, what can I do to help?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMany things, not only are we asking for donations to help our cause, but we want more members, we want a large community, we want ideas, graphics, art, suggestions, games to play, friends, collaborators. Whatever you feel you are creative and good at within this industry or not - if you think it could help us? Join us!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRegardless of whether or not you support us financially, please support us in our community. Subscribe to our channel, leave a comment, join the discord, whatever you are comfortable.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e...and most of all.
