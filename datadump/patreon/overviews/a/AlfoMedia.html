    "summary": "Hi! My name is Harrison and I\u0027m the creator and sole proprietor of Alfo Media. In late 2016 I felt trapped. I wanted an outlet to fill all of my creative desires and needs. I\u0027m absolutely obsessive when it comes to certain passions I have in life, the main ones being music \u0026amp; film. On top of those, I also love editing videos/photos, writing, and creating in general. I wanted a place where I could fulfill all those things, and thus, a YouTube channel was born! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne of my goals in all of this was to create something from scratch. So, initially at least, I didn\u0027t really want my name connected to it. I wanted to build something from nothing, so I wanted a nonsense word to build a brand out of. I was watching Marvel\u0027s Luke Cage on Netflix and one of the main characters, who is an older/mentor type, would always say \"Always forward\" as advice to the titular character. That phrase stuck with me. It was positive, held themes of perseverance, and I just fell in love with it! So I took both words and combined them into one: Alfo. The way I pronounce it would be \"Al\" as in \"Alex\" and \"fo\" as in \"foe\". Then, I threw \"Media\" on the end of it because I thought that would encompass whatever it is I would be creating with this channel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince its creation, I\u0027ve been creating profiles on up-and-coming musicians, film analyses, and more! With the busy schedule of a college student, I sadly haven\u0027t been able to spend too much time on this project. Mainly, for the past few months, it\u0027s been a once a week thing. I want that all to change and I need your help! To create upwards of three videos a week, get better equipment, spend more time on videos, and improve my craft, I\u0027m reaching out to all of you. Patreon is an incredible website that has let so many creators bring their art to the world. With your help, I want to continue to do the same. I\u0027ve tried to create tiers that are desirable to my audience. I truly want you to get as much out of this as I am! Tell me what videos you want. Show me how to be a better creator. Help this channel grow and we can all make something truly great! I can\u0027t thank everyone enough for watching my videos, sharing them with friends, and sending nice comments. But for anyone who is willing to help donate to this Patreon and help me, I don\u0027t even know what to say. There aren\u0027t enough words to describe how much that means to me. Thank you. So, without further adieu, let\u0027s do this!"
