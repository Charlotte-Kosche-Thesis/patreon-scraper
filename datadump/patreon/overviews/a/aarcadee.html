    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Alex McDaniel, and I run a little Youtube channel under the moniker, Aarcadee. My channel is all about video games and some current gaming trends. More specifically, I post video game\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/f04tqqIv_Ww\"\u003ereviews\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Nq76DV90dIA\"\u003ehighlights\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/3vr0MpDn264\"\u003epodcasts\u003c/a\u003e,\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e and the occasional\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/dbguWzrxH5I\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eodd bit of content\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. I post every Thursday at 3pm/PST, and have only missed one week since I started back in September 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eI am very much dedicated to my channel and treat it as a second job. \u003cbr\u003eWith that being said, I don\u0027t make any money with this job like I do with my full-time one. But I believe my channel is now at the level of professionalism to warrant looking for ways to make it a reliable source of income.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI know this is a common thing for people to ask for now-a-days, and I understand completely if you don\u0027t feel like helping out some random guy on the internet. I don\u0027t expect anyone to help me, but I will always appreciate it when someone does. And it isn\u0027t like I\u0027m just sitting at home, wasting away, playing video games all day, and uploading some half-assed video to Youtube, either. I work a full-time job outside of the time I spend with the channel. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll I\u0027m here on Patreon for is to ask if you\u0027d consider pledging to the channel. If you enjoy the content I make, and would like to help it grow to potentially something more some day, then maybe consider supporting it. It would help me out tremendously, and would allow me to spend more time making videos for you all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon is a service that allows content creators to receive monthly contributions from their fans, so that they can continue to do what they love, all while supporting themselves. Patreon is more beneficial for content creators than say, something like, ad revenue. Not only is the pay more predictable, but it also allows for more independence and freedom of speech. There are no big corporations here telling us what to say.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eInstead, that responsibility lies with the fans. By supporting the channel, you\u0027re given the ability to really have your opinions heard. For you to find this content entertaining enough to support, it\u0027s logical that I be more transparent with you. I can\u0027t promise I\u0027ll always agree with you, but I will always listen and take into consideration the opinions I receive.\u003cbr\u003eWith that said though, never feel obligated to pledge. Pledges are not required, however they are always greatly appreciated. And not donating doesn\u0027t lock you out of any exclusive content or deem you as any less of a supporter. I like to talk with every viewer that I can, regardless of whether or not they pledge. Each and every viewers voice matters to me, as I\u0027d be nothing without the people who support me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, if I did pledge for a monthly donation, what would it go towards?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eExcellent question, theoretical person. The funds received from Patreon go to supporting the channel, first and foremost. I\u0027ll be using it to purchase new equipment (like lighting, green screen), new games for content ($10-$60), and that\u0027s about it. Maybe a studio set some day. Who knows?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAnything else you\u0027d like to mention?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eHonestly that\u0027s about it. If you read this page to the end, then thank you. Regardless of whether or not you decide to pledge, thank you for reading through these paragraphs. It still amazes me that people genuinely enjoy my content and want to see more of it. I didn\u0027t create this Patreon because I felt like it. I did it because a few of you had asked me if I had a place for you to donate to support me. Well here you go. Thank you for the, what, third time now. For giving my content a chance, and helping some dude who plays video games pursue what he loves to do. I hope that I can continue to entertain you all for a long time to come. Whether or not you\u0027re a Patron, you will still get the same love and appreciation. You also get the same content, and the same amount of honesty, as I\u0027d be nothing without any of you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m not trying to become a millionaire, I\u0027m just trying to make a living doing what I love.\u003cbr\u003e"
