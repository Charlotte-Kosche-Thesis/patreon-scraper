I\u0027ve been painting miniatures since 2004 when I was introduced to the world of roleplaying games and miniature painting. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then I have worked as a professional studio painter at Privateer Press, Miniature Caster and General Warehouse Monkey at Reaper Miniatures and even a Creative Consultant at Steam Forged Games. I have and continue to be involved in projects within the Miniature Figurine world with the goal of helping to further the art education on the hobby side of miniature painting as well as trying to build up the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5716acb822482ed552000dbb/t/5931411cd2b8578e43352819/1496401242930/?format=300w\" style=\"background-color: initial; text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI have been working professionally as a painter for 10 years and I am currently self employed with a large part of my job involving traveling to other countries to teach Painting and Art Theory classes as well as 2 day Private Coachings at my house in Australia.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also travel to teach at conventions and have been doing so since 2006. I have taught at GenCon (USA), ReaperCon (USA), Lock n Load (USA), Adepticon (USA) CanCon (Australia), and Scale Model Challenge (EU).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMark Soley, is also part of the Arcane Paintworks banner. Painting and Wargaming is his hobby but every now and again likes to be involved in what I am doing professionally. He\u0027s helped write some blogs and likes to post his Work In Progress images whether it is for gaming quality models or display. He is the last Australian Slayer Sword Winner in 2012 and has won several awards Internationally. He has also taught at several conventions including Adepticon (USA) and CanCon (Australia) and will be teaching at Scale Model Challenge 2017.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find Portfolio Gallerys for both, Mark and myself, at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.arcanepaintworks.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eArcane Paintworks\u003c/a\u003e as well as a list of my current course offerings around the world! And of course you can find us on Instagram @Arcane_Paintworks or Facebook @ArcanePaintworks\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Goals\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePeople always ask for more access to me whether it is writing blogs or tutorials or producing art books and even online coaching sessions. Part of the problem being self employed is that time is money and money is time. This means that I already have to have a surplus of funds in order to create time in my schedule to produce all of these different projects I would love to tackle.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5716acb822482ed552000dbb/595d9a284f14bcbcd4f10579/595d9a2a1b10e33a3b22d96f/1499306679755/Danerys1.jpg?format=300w\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003eThis is where you, The Community, come in! You can help myself and Mark to achieve our content production goals by pledging to our Patreon every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur first project goal is to be able to provide a monthly blog post. The blog post could be anything from an indepth tutorial, an art theory explanation or my thoughts on a particular matter.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur second project goal we would like to tackle is producing a small 24 page booklet of some of our painted pieces, both currently existing pieces and ones we would like to have the time to produce in the future. We will include a list of our Patrons names in the back of the booklet in an Acknowledgements section.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur third project goal is to be able to produce a 48-60 page art book that includes full page, full color shots of pieces on one page and a collage of several Work In Progess shots on another page with some explanation and a couple of short tutorials. We will produce a version of this book available only to our supporters with some exclusive content as well as another edition sold to the general public through our store. We will publish a page of our Patrons\u0027 names in the back of the book under an Acknowledgements section.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe Booklet and Book would be produced at the end of a 12 month period, then shipped out to all Patrons at the appropriate levels. Shipping fees will be determined prior to posting products.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnother project I will be testing in the next month is doing time lapse videos of entire projects. From cleaning, gluing, base construction, painting and all that goes into a project. This will not be a tutorial. This will be a 10min (or shorter) time lapse video so you can see the process. That is the goal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll of our Patrons will have the opportunity to purchase any of our finished projects listed for sale, before any others, at a lower price. This allows the Patrons to add a unique piece to their own private collection!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5716acb822482ed552000dbb/595da0463e00be648e4f3948/595da073f5e2313a005d18d5/1499308156566/gobbo05__sized_l.jpg?format=300w\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere Does Your Money Go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWant to know what we will spend the money on?
