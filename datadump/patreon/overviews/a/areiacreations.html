    "summary": "Hello guys! Thank you so\nmuch for making it to Areia Creations\u2019 Patreon page! My name is Yiorgos or as\nmany people call me \u201cJun\u201d. Following my passion, I moved to Korea in 2009 and\nstarted offering my music productions to the exciting Kpop community through \u201cAreia\nRemix\u201d. Soon I was called by the local entertainment companies to work on official\nremixes and original K-pop songs. Throughout the years, I have collaborated and\nlearnt the craft of artist training, development and production first hand, from\nthe K-pop masters themselves. At the same time, I was mesmerised by the craft of filming\nand I started producing and directing my own music videos.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAfter a successful funding\ncampaign, I have officially established Areia Creations as an independent\nrecord label, with the intention to create and release the first original Areia\nCreations productions and help independent artists and groups release their own\nworks in a well-produced manner. Since then I have dedicated my days and nights,\nweekdays and weekends, acquiring all the experience, understanding and skills\nrequired to achieve artistic expression at the highest level. From the days of \u201cI\u201d,\nmaking kpop remixes for fun from my bedroom, to the days of \u201cWe\u201d that Areia\nCreations is a union of producers, artists, volunteers and investors, it was\nall possible because of you: the amazing kpop community that has been supporting\nus since the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nCurrently we are operating\nfrom a small home studio in Seoul. We aim much higher. We dream even higher. We\nfeel the need to convey our knowledge and passion through meaningful artistic\nexpression. We wish to help incredible local and international talented independent\nartists find their way to being produced and published. Finally, we want to create\nproducts that fit the peculiar taste of the international K-pop fanbase. All\nthese things cost a lot of money. In order to stay independent, keep creating\nremixes and original products we hope for your love and support through funding.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy joining our Patreon, we\nwelcome you aboard our long journey. Your funding goes towards paying rent\nspace, bills, other company expenses and ultimately artist development and\nproduction. Patreon is a volunteering platform. If you are considering a further investment instead, we have\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.areiacreations.com/invest\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ea private investment scheme\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eImportant notes:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eYou will only receive any rewards after your pledge is processed for the month.
