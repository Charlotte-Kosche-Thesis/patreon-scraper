A lot of time - between research, writing the scripts, filming, shooting B-roll, editing, etc, each video takes between 10-25 hours to produce and upload.  I upload videos \u003cstrong\u003eweekly,\u003c/strong\u003e so in order to keep the quality high and the content fresh and interesting, I have to make sure that I spend time on them.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nUnfortunately, finding time is \u003cem\u003eexceptionally\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0difficult.\u00a0This is time that I have to squeeze into my busy schedule trying to survive and build my career as a musician in New York City, where the median rent for a one bedroom apartment is over $3,000 a month. I suppose I could support myself another way and then do YouTube videos in my spare time, but a major factor in why people like my videos is the fact that I do make my living the way I do - playing music full time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBasically, \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI need your help.\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003ePatreon is a way for me to really focus on exactly what I want to do both in the world of professional music and on YouTube and dedicate the time that I need to really let this channel grow and flourish.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat I could do instead of Patreon\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI could do branded content - people paying me to make videos to promote certain apps, gear, etc. I\u0027ve been approached to do this sort of thing, and I\u0027ve decided against it, because it doesn\u0027t really fit the vibe of what I want to do - create intellectually and artistically stimulating things that aim to inspire and teach, rather than shilling one product or another. Don\u0027t get me wrong, I have the utmost respect for people who do this sort of thing, but I don\u0027t think it it\u0027s for me!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThis is a one-man operation, but thanks to Patreon and your support, it\u0027s can be so much more!
