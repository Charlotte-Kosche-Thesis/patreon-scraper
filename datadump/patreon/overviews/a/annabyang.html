My life took an unexpected turn in September of 2015 when my daughter, Nelle, was stillborn.  A few short months later, I lost a second baby girl, Iris.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI write to bring awareness to how loss continues to permeate everyday life.  Loss is part of my identity, but does not solely define me. I am a writer, a spouse, a mother and a bereaved mother, and a friend who enjoys hot coffee and hot yoga.\u00a0 I live in a suburb of Chicago and blog on my website\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://grievingoutloud.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eGrieving Out Loud\u003c/a\u003e.\u00a0 My writing has also been featured in other places, such as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://entropymag.org/the-birds-thanksgiving-birds/\"\u003eEntropy Magazine\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/refugeingrief/posts/1556190727800027:0\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eRefuge in Grief\u003c/a\u003e, and the\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20171013/mom-shares-story-of-lost-pregnancies\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eChicago Daily Herald\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Goals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePregnancy loss is a topic that is often not discussed, and as a culture, we are hard on people that are grieving.\u00a0 We expect grief to have a set timetable and an end date.\u00a0 I want to share my story and writing with a wider audience. \u00a0I want to reach people who have had similar experiences that may find comfort in knowing that they are not alone, and also help people who have not experienced pregnancy loss understand and support people who have.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Projects:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am working on a book and also a chapbook of poetry.\u00a0 Writing is my passion, and as I continue to pursue it, I will have costs related to my website, publication, promotion, etc.\u00a0 One way or the other, my voice will be heard, but patronage truly means the world to me: that people are supportive of my journey.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Patrons:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eThe ashes of my daughters Nelle and Iris are scattered beneath a tree in the Coulee where I grew up.
