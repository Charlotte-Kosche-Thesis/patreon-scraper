    "summary": "\u003ch2\u003eCreativity with a Conscience.\u003c/h2\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHey! I\u0027m Ahsante - YouTuber, multi-media artist, filmmaker, and recent Harvard college grad (i.e. a huge nerd).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I say on my \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/AhsantetheArtist\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e, I want to encourage folks to live spiritedly and think creatively.\u00a0My goal is to create media that\u0027s a spirited reflection of the lives we live and grapples critically with the problems we face. I aim to make videos that touch people, get you to think about life differently, realize a truth about society or yourself, or that simply inspire and make your day a little brighter :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn my YouTube channel I make vlogs about social issues, hustling through life (without burning out), and pure expressions of creativity like short films and music videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i53.photobucket.com/albums/g73/AhsanteB/Patreon/PatreonStrip_zpskxrconqw.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhy Give?\u00a0\u003c/h2\u003eIf you think my videos are valuable, if they\u0027ve made an impact or inspired you, if you think voices like mine should be represented, then supporting on Patreon is the best way to make sure my videos continue. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRight now I\u0027m squeezing video making into my \"free\" time, so I can\u0027t always make it a priority - and there may come a time where I can\u0027t afford to (we all know time = $). But Patreon funds will go directly to making my channel financially sustainable, improving the production quality of my videos,\u00a0and hopefully growing a team (right now I\u0027m riding solo).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can also make a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.paypal.me/AhsanteB\"\u003eone-time donation\u003c/a\u003e via PayPal, if that works better for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat if you\u0027re broke?\u003c/h2\u003eNo worries! If you\u0027re tight on cash, even just $1 per month would be super helpful - and you can do that by pledging $1 and setting a monthly maximum of 1 video per month. Feel free to tailor to your budget!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd even if you don\u0027t have $1 to spare (the hustle is real, the rent is too darn high, you\u0027re on that student grind - I get it), you can always share my videos, sign up for my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.ahsantetheartist.com/newsletter/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eemail newsletter\u003c/a\u003e, and encourage your friends to subscribe! Those are the best non-money ways of supporting - and thanks for watching!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/h2\u003eI want my Patreon to be a community. As a patron, you can get: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAccess to my Patreon feed where I post videos, updates, and welcome feedback and discussion.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eOpportunity to suggest video topics and get shoutouts\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBehind the scenes looks at my video making and \"Ahsante the Artist\" activities, monthly livestreams, and more ways for us to connect directly.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eOften the comments that I get on my YouTube videos are what keep me motivated to keep creating, even when time is tight, and I\u0027d like to continue those conversations here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch2\u003eHow often do I post videos?\u003c/h2\u003eI typically upload between 2-4 videos a month. Feel free to set a monthly cap on donations if you like, that way you don\u0027t have to worry if I\u0027m feeling super productive :) And the nice part is that pledges are directly correlated to output, so if there\u0027s a month where I can\u0027t make a video - you want be charged. Thanks so much for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
