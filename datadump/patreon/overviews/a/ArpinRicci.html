While we both work full-time (and then some), we have generally shared a single modest income. However, as our family grows and the demands of our work increase, we need to grow our support base as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSadly, we have also seen a drop in our support because some of our donors disagree with some of ministry focus and theology. While we fully respect their right to support only that which they are comfortable with, this means that we need to find new partners who are willing to stand with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor many people, the assumption is that to support us requires a sizeable monthly donation. In truth, the best kind of support base we can build is many people giving small amounts. Though larger donations are welcome \u0026amp; needed, to have a group of people commit to a few dollars a month goes a long way to make what we do possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease become a part of our team and help us keep serving in Winnipeg\u0027s West End \u0026amp; beyond!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e(Canadians who want to receive a tax receipt, please \u003ca href=\"http://www.ywamcanada.org/donations.html\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efollow the instructions found here\u003c/a\u003e.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
