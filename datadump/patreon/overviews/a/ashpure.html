Why now? \u003cem\u003eWhy am I asking you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eListen, I\u0027ve been making the comic and surrounding story world for\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThe Lion \u0026amp; The Unicorn\u003c/strong\u003e, in its current form, since 2011 and have managed 4 issues - that\u0027s slightly less than a book a year.

Making comics always gets pushed further and further down the - ever growing, teetering on the edge of a breakdown - to do list. Because the rent\u0027s got to be paid and the fridge needs to be filled with something other than hot sauce and capers (it turns out you can\u0027t live on condiments).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut maybe there\u0027s hope, maybe, just maybe, there\u0027s a way...

Made available to subscribers exclusively by the \u003cstrong\u003ebritomart Conglomerate\u003c/strong\u003e, who design, manufacture and distribute the disposable, technology patches, known as brands, which grant their user exponentially enhanced mental and physical capabilities.
