I decided to do patreon since there has been a large request for my implied and nude picture sets\u003cbr\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHere\u0027s where you come in!\u003c/h3\u003eIf you \u003cstrong\u003ereally enjoy\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0my\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0modeling\u003c/strong\u003e(depending on your tier) pictures posted for all patreon levels, start to do giveaways for Patreon milestones, early access news on stream-related events, voting polls on future cosplays, and future photoshoot pictures, then you can help me out! \u003cstrong\u003eKEEP MY CONTENT FLOWING AND MY DREAMS ALIVE!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSign up as a Patreon supporter here and help me by donating whatever tier you choose or you can edit the amount to whatever you can afford. \u003cstrong\u003eAnything counts\u003c/strong\u003e and helps me out a ton. \u003cstrong\u003ePlease don\u0027t feel like you HAVE to become a Patreon, a lot of my content is still free and it\u0027s completely up to you.\u2661\u003c/strong\u003eYou are the reason why I do what I do,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAngelina. Marie\u2661\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does your pledge support? Where does it go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt helps me afford better equipment for quality vlogs/streams, giveaways, more time to make content, and come up with new content. I desperatly need a new PC because it crashes on stream all the time!! Grr.  Also, your pledge is 100% between me and you and no one can see your name, information, or how much you pledge besides me. I do not associate with any solicitors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS:\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: What is the Google Hangout Session?\u003cbr\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003eThe Google Hangout Sessions is something you have to schedule a day with me through patreon messages where we can hangout through discord (just you and me) by playing games, watching movies or anime, or just to talk. This is a great way to get to know the real me. (weekends work best since I don\u0027t stream on those days.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: When do I get my Rewards?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA: \u003c/strong\u003e Everything is done by receiving a message from me for any game adds, follow backs, and snapchat adds. To help get those rewards faster since I\u0027m a one woman team, shoot me a patreon message and let me know what tier you redeemed and all of your information in one sweet message.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: When does the money I pledge get taken out?\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e As a new Patreon, it will be immediate and that goes for upgrades too. If you are automatically renewing your pledge, it charges you every 1st week of the month. For example: If you pledge on December 28th, you will receive rewards from December and January. It\u0027ll be the first of every month afterwards instead of the day (28th) you started your pledge on.\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to upgrade on the road, it will charge you the money difference between your current tier and the tier you are upgrading to immediately. Current Tier: $10 -\u0026gt; upgrades to $50 = Charged $40.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: I didn\u0027t get my reward and I\u0027m still waiting on my add backs etc.\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e I\u0027m sorry and sometimes I have a lot going on to plan for you. I\u0027m just one person and I try to keep up. PLEASE inbox me\u00a0and provide me with your info that your tier allows!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Can I cancel or change my pledge at any time?\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes! Check under \u0027Your Pledges\u0027 tab. If you increase your pledge for the month, that difference will be charged immediately, so you can upgrade to a higher tier or cancel at any time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: How can I contact you directly?\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Better way to contact me directly is through your inbox and to send a message to me. This way I get an email alert from you to check my patreon app from my phone.(:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eQ: Do I have access to past posts?\u003cbr\u003eA:\u003c/strong\u003e Yes. All patreon tiers have access to past posts. Except for any events that are limited edition.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFeel welcomed to look around and if you have any requests for future content, let me know!
