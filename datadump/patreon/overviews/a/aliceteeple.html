    "summary": "\u003cimg src=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/22703393@N04/33924562695/in/album-72157679123621493/\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://flic.kr/p/TFNfzn\"\u003eI have been in New York City for two and a half years. After ten years of working in academia and retail, I have thrown my entire being into working as a freelance photographer.\u00a0Freelance work, as many of you know, is a constant cycle of feast/famine. I work part time as a nanny, but would like to really make a go of it as a full time photographer.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIn the past year I have done extensive work as a documentary photographer, taking cues from Gilded Age and Depression-era photographers to focus on American poverty and gentrification.\u00a0 I\u0027m willing to take risks for interesting images that could never happen again; for instance, breaking into the Domino Sugar Factory in Williamsburg before its renovation into condos; hopping a fence with NPR\u0027s Amy Goodman to document an ICE release. I also spent a week last year documenting life for a woman with lupus in central PA, and her struggle to receive adequate medical care. I have documented many of the protests happening in NYC, as well. I\u0027m interested in telling a story, first and foremost, and my primary goal is to create images that inspire people to act. Gordon Parks, Jacob Riis, Lewis Hine, Dorothea Lange and their contemporaries are my inspiration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving spent most of my life in poverty, it is a subject I carry close to my heart. I do not rely on any government programs at the moment. My sole income is nannying and taking pictures. Sometimes I will work as a PA on other shoots. Much of my work, specifically protest work and street documentation, is volunteer. To be fully available and mentally present for these events requires a flexible schedule and working equipment.. I am blessed to have both now, but that also means my income is flexible. I would like to continue this work and possibly even do some traveling up and down the East Coast to further document the state of class in the United States. I also intend to write essays to accompany my photography and hope this leads to gallery shows and articles in magazines. I do not have a day job; part of this is because I need absolute focus and availability of time to leave at a moment\u0027s notice, as well as complete freedom to express my own views (and not worry about offending a boss down the line).\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eIf you have been following my work and enjoy what I am doing, I am deeply grateful. It means so much to me. I throw my heart and soul into all of my photography, no matter whether it\u0027s a band doing a live show or a psychological exploration through performance art - it\u0027s all me.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u0027re at all able to financially contribute to my work, this is what it will go towards:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1) Rent and food. I primarily exist on pasta and potatoes in order to be able to pay my rent of $650/month. Without steady income or any family/spousal support, I\u0027m barely scraping by. I would like to do photo essays, for instance, about coal towns like Pottsville and Shamokin; rural poverty in Appalachia, and the demise of factory towns. Having experienced abject poverty firsthand for many years, I have a unique empathy toward these situations and want to help be a voice to make things better for everyone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e2) Equipment purchases/upkeep. I would like to get a 28mm lens next. I have a Canon 7D, and a 2011 Macbook. I currently shoot my street work on an iPhone 6, but the phone subscription has been turned off because it was too expensive. I use wifi for communicating with everyone. I subscribe to Adobe Creative Suite to do my work, which eats up quite a bit of my meager income, but allows me to do my best editing work. At some point - not yet, but in the next year or two -\u00a0 I will probably need to upgrade the laptop.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e3) Travel expenses. I travel all over the city and my big splurge every week is an unlimited $32 Metrocard. I rely on the Metrocard to get to nannying jobs, club gigs, and on site location shoots.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are at all able to send anything, you have my deepest gratitude and I will not let you down. I simply need a financial safety net in order to continue. I can live well within my means and am extraordinarily frugal, but I would like to accomplish more with my work and humbly ask for some assistance from my myriad of supporters. In return, I will give you something beautiful, and bragging rights.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you very much.\u003cbr\u003eHere is my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/22703393@N04/albums\"\u003ehttps://www.flickr.com/photos/22703393@N04/albums\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
