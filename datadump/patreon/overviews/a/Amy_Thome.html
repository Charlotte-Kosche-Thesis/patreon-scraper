    "summary": "My dream is to live \u0026amp; work full time on a sailboat, traveling extensively all over the world in order to write about my experiences \u0026amp; also be a huge part of the sailing community, sharing the lifestyle \u0026amp; encouraging others to as well. My first sailing experience was NY to Bar Harbor Maine. Since then I\u0027ve sailed from St. John to Camden Maine, Nova Scotia to St. Augustine Florida, \u0026amp; then from Bermuda to the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. I hope to then sail the Northwest Passage in 2018 or 2019.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"On a day when the wind is perfect, the sail just needs to open \u0026amp; the world is full of beauty. Today is such a day\"~ Rumi\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n Never in my life have I felt at home living in a house, a solid \nunmoving structure. Most girls grow up desiring a beautiful house, a \nsuccessful career perhaps, a husband, white picket fence, a pet, \u0026amp; \nmaybe those 2.5 children\u2026I have never desired any of those things, but \nsomewhere along the way into adulthood, I\n curiously started following that construct, that path that everyone \nseems to think they have to take, which for me personally I kind of view\n as a trap..  I owned a gorgeous 1922 English Tudor, that was a woman\u0027s \ncomplete dream  ~filled with antiques, a completely remodeled kitchen to\n easily enjoy preparing gourmet meals from scratch, a bourgeois white \nfluffy carpeted office, \u0026amp; a wood-burning fireplace lined with large \nbookshelves. I had chandeliers, an arched front door, slate \nbacksplashes, a white claw-footed antique office desk... I always drove \nnice cars.. I had a loving German Australian shepherd, \u0026amp; even had a \n10 year relationship going at one time, as well as a very high paying \ncorporate finance job in management. A job that let me take killer \nvacations to places like India \u0026amp; Brazil ..  I attained the degree \n\u0026amp; a handful of financial licenses in the Wall Street world..  I had \nit all, from the looks of it.. But NONE of these things made me happy, \nnor at peace. Something was always off, amiss\u2026 these things didn\u2019t \nsustain me, feed me, or make me feel content whatsoever. There was \nalways a nagging ache for more.  I felt chained by these THINGS. I have \nalways been a seeker by nature for as long as I can remember back into \nchildhood. I questioned organized religion when I was 16. I\u2019ve always \nasked why. I\u0027ve always looked at society like something was askew.. I\u2019ve\n always known there was far MORE to this life. I didn\u2019t want to follow \nthat conveyor belt of uniformity, of lifestyles around me that all \nseemed to be fabricated from an eerily similar mold. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e It wasn\u2019t\n until I finally grew the balls after years of deliberating in my head, \nto take the plunge \u0026amp; say goodbye to it all. I sold my house \nincluding everything in it, I quit my job, \u0026amp; left my relationship. \nAround 2012 is when it all began to shake, \u0026amp; in hindsight in the \nmost eloquent way. I discovered the world of yoga \u0026amp; meditation, \n\u0026amp; it was all uphill from there. Well maybe not uphill exactly, but \nyoga has a very interesting way of seeping into your every pore, \u0026amp; \nmaking it so there is now no way BUT to start shedding. It starts to \nmake you have very little tolerance for those things in your life that \nno longer feed you. You begin to simplify. It can feel like the earth is\n actually crumbling beneath you, but in fact, it\u2019s causing you to become\n alive again, to begin to realize your true self, your true essence. The\n person that has been there all along, but it was buried beneath all the\n clutter from the conditioning that started back when you were a child..\n Yoga \u0026amp; meditation, whether you like it or not, begins to show you \nthe cage you\u2019ve been living in, \u0026amp; you begin the process of rattling \nthose bars. The lenses that you used to view the world via are now being\n wiped clean of: the debris of a lifetime of other people\u2019s \nexpectations, the norms society places on us, \u0026amp; the fears that our \nmedia/government have put into our psyche. You truly begin to gain more \nclarity than you could ever have imagined. It\u2019s chilling, but herein \nbegins your own glorious personal climb out of the playpen. What would \nyou rather choose~ a lifetime of robotic living or the newfound ability \nto chart your own way. Four months ago, I finally let go of the career \nthat I had been chasing for over 11 years. I went into work one day, \nwrote a long email, \u0026amp; left an hour later with no notice. My soul \ncould not take another day. Since then I began one of the most beautiful\n chapters of my life. I finally found a place that I truly feel is \n\u2018home\u2019 to me. And that is on the water. I just happened to start taking a\n curious interest in sailboats. For no apparent reason whatsoever I was \ndrawn to them. Taking up sailing lessons has begun to show me that what \nis \u2018home\u2019 is so vastly different from person to person. For me, I have \nnever felt a peace like I do when I\u2019m in motion, when the wind is \nlashing my body, when the boat is heeling over on it\u2019s side. It\u2019s a rush\n I have never experienced. The water rocks me to sleep at night, \u0026amp; \nwelcomes me into her vast maternal benevolence again each day. This is \nhome, This is home. I have no idea what is to come, but I don\u0027t regret a\n thing, except wishing I had done it sooner ~\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pinterest.com%2Famythome%2Fdreams%257E%2F\u0026amp;h=-AQFzKHto\u0026amp;enc=AZNCVGpH61R05YM2Rdv84tw9lYsCNI53y4rh31B7wzEarVefO3y21v8dif6894xM2VXf4OWzes5XqMcpD-v42yEPsvsBkcq_jq3sfvyGlL5r19f7tNvvJb_nEeHVqFYFl8RgrndXdNJlpDA-efv_l6ei\u0026amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttps://www.pinterest.com/\u0026lt;wbr\u0026gt;amythome/dreams%7E/\u0026lt;/wbr\u0026gt;\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
