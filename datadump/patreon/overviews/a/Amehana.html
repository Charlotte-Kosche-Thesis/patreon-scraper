I started with \"The Shadow Chronicles\" which followed Flightessa and Angelina/Willow on their adventures in Earth and Terrah. A great deal of that series needs rewriting as it was my first set of stories and most of the files have since been lost in moves. My first published book was the first in the series \"Dragon Shaman\" which follows BlowingWind in her adventures within the mundane world and the spirit world. The other series that I am working on is \"Selkies\u0027 Skins\" which is currently having the second book written. My intent is to release each book in these three series as webserial novels, and then publish them to ebook and print after each of the books in the three series have undergone their respective editing processes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eNames I Have Published or Illustrated Under:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eTeresa Huddleston-Garcia (old, first books and editions)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTeresa Garcia\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eTeresa Amehana Garcia\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAmethyst Stormrider\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eLadyRainStarDragon\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eAmehanaRainStarDrago\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eAlso known as: Amehana Arashi and Amehana Ishtari in Second Life.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDue to my health my \u0027hobby\u0027 became my work. Creating stories is work, and creating books costs money. Even as a publisher the funding for editors and cover art comes from my own pocket, not just when it comes to funding the editing and art for my own works. Even when doing illustrations myself there is still the matter of paying myself so I can pay the bills, buy the Deathwish Coffee that fuels my writing, and all those other lovely things. A dollar a month can add up to a great deal of help. Royalties only add up when books are being bought, and are a small trickle of any author\u0027s income.\u003cbr\u003eThis is where you come in. Your monthly payment pledges contribute to things such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ekeeping the bills paid (and if lucky, toward very needed home renovations)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e kids and service animals fed\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e power\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ethe horridly expensive internet, since all that is available in my location is Satellite Internet\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003efunding writing time (poetry, fiction, writing advice, meditations)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003epaying an outside editor on my own writings\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eeventually being able to pay Illya Leonov up front for narrating the next book of Selkies\u0027 Skins, as agreed, and the Dragon Shaman books\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eand all those other lovely things that self-employed stay at home mothers need help with.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCurrent Priority Projects:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eSelkies\u0027 Skins book two\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMythical \u0026amp; Folkloric Poetry\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePoem Videos\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Ian\u0027s Realm Saga (by D L Gardner) audiobook recording\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eEaster challenge for Dragon Hearts RPG website\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStory reads (recorded for Youtube, many themes)\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLower Priority Projects:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eBook Reviews\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePure ASMR videos (as opposed to just soothing reads)\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eMeditations\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eShort Stories\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eDragon Shaman book three\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eThe Shadow Chronicles rewrites\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePony themed mods and commissions for Second Life\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eGoals:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo the side you will see a goal to be met and how much further to the next milestone. I encourage you to look through them, and they do update at times. Most of these amounts are cumulative. By collectively pledging to a goal amount that locks in those activities as a minimum of what you can expect to see from me. Other goals are procurement of things such as an editor, upgrading equipment, paying an external narrator. This is on top of getting my writing time paid. One of the goals listed is full time pay, which would allow me to finish and release much faster without having to worry. From time to time goals and amounts will change as projects get met. You will also see what you get in return at each personal tier pledge level. Most tier rewards are cumulative as well. If you have suggestions on what you would like to see as a pledge tier reward then please feel free to let me know.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou might think of your monthly pledge as a tip, but for me... it\u0027s earned. There is a growing log of things that only Patrons have access to, in addition to the publicly posted works.
