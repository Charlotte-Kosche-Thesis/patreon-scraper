    "summary": "Hello! And welcome to the Adventures in Erylia Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAdventures in Erylia is a casual play Dungeons and Dragons podcast, set in the homebrew setting of Erylia. We are 4 players, Caitlin, Chantalle, Chris, and Christa, along with Damian, our DM and creator of Erylia. The Adventures in Erylia Family would like to thank you for joining us on our adventures and for your contributions that allow us to continue to improve and grow.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can find out more about us and follow us at adventuresinerylia.com\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is a goal of Adventures in Erylia not to gate our main content, the story campaigns, behind a paywall. The only story episodes that are going to be on the Patreon are episodes from when we first started recording and were using a Blue Yeti. We decided to pull these episodes entirely, but decided that if you\u0027d like to support the show, we will grant access to these episodes, in all of their poor audio quality glory, for only $1/mo. Since getting a new set of gear for recording, all story episodes will be in the main feed for free and supporting us on Patreon will get you access to things like our out takes, as well as art and map downloads when those are available.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to expand a little bit on our goals as well. Our first few goals are laid out as covering some of our regular expenses. However, those are things I am already paying for. In reality, the money earned from Patreon sits in our Patreon wallet and gets cashed out at a time to do things like upgrade equipment or pay for software.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs always, you can reach us through email at feedback@adventuresinerylia.com or on our FaceBook or Twitter"
