For a long time I\u2019ve been trying to get into video game development, but life got in the way and many factors discouraged me from taking it as a career path back when I was a student. My games are focused on story-telling and artwork that illustrates it as it is being told.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGame development started as a hobby, a craft I got into for the love of working on it. While the passion for it stays to this day it has become a bit of a second job, I spend nearly every waking hour just working on making games.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003ch1 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 129, 189);\"\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/h1\u003eMy games are free and I plan to keep them that way, but I also plan to leave the value of my games to whoever plays them. In return to those who find value in my work and support them, the earnings the games receive will be used to improve their production value. It will go into hiring composers to give it an individual soundtrack, proofreaders to make sure the games are refined to be up to standards, and the possibility of hiring voice talent and translators to make it playable for a larger player base. Besides all these refinements, my supporters are given rewards ranging from in-game credits, exclusively drawn art material and other material that will hopefully make this worthwhile.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\t\u003cimg src=\"http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/games/1/58/57057/thumb_620x2000/screen_2.gif\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\t\u003cem\u003e(Work in Progress)\u003c/em\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003eGame development is as expensive as playing games as a hobby, it obviously requires hardware to make and the art I\u2019m making requires powerful enough hardware to handle it.
