    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs of this edit (12/18/17) the future content of my YouTube channel is still shifting. I\u0027m adapting with the times. The video projects I intend to work on in the next few months are:\u003cbr\u003e- Continuing to field viewer comments, questions, and requests\u003cbr\u003e- Filming activism in person\u003cbr\u003e- Collaborations with The Colorado YouTube Club at https://www.meetup.com/ColoradoYouTubeClub\u003cbr\u003e- Following court proceedings in person (TheSkepticFeminist murder trial and the Lebsock scandal in particular)\u003cbr\u003e- An immersion project into the craft of scientific surveys, how they work, and whether predictions of experimenter intent can be made by subjects during a survey\u003cbr\u003e- Videos on counseling theory, especially as it pertains to the field of addiction\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003cbr\u003e- Gas money for a YouTuber who actually goes out and films things in the real world\u003cbr\u003e- Camera and computer gear\u003cbr\u003e- I have purchased terrabyte drives, computer repair parts, and a few camera accessories with the funds I have raised here. The terrabyte drives alone were a huge boon to me being able to archive the work of YouTubers who are at risk of having their voices silenced through censorship.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never made the amount of money that it costs to make the videos that I do from the videos themselves. I\u0027m OK with that because making videos is a passion that I have that gives me the satisfaction of being proud of myself. If you added up the time it all took, all the gas I\u0027ve used to drive to the various activism events that I\u0027ve filmed, and the gear I use, I\u0027ve invested thousands into the content I make. If you enjoyed watching me, that gives me the warm fuzzies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e I\u0027m going to make content available for free to everyone until I\u0027m dead. I\u0027m never going to do any Patreon exclusives or upfront content fees on any platform. I\u0027ve made over 3000 videos on the AgentOfDoubt YouTube channel and I sometimes put out content daily for weeks at a time, so I\u0027m not charging per video here on Patreon either. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is just another way to support what I do aside from ad revenue from YouTube ads. I\u0027ve made it farther than a lot of content creators in longevity, output, and subscriber base, but I am realistic with my expectations and I feel\u00a0good making content for a niche audience that appreciates what I do."
