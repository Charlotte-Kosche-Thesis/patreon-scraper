    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u00a0\u00a0 Addictions. They come in all shapes and sizes. From fried foods to alcohol, we hear about it more and more every day. There are many addictive substances that have different effects on people. While some addictions are both physical and psychological, others may be mostly psychological. With so much misinformation out there about addiction, I feel it is important to shine a light on the subject and maybe we can all learn a little bit about addiction and its devastating effects.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 As a recovering addict I know and understand first hand what addiction is like. Now that I am sober I want to use my knowledge on the subject to help others. Through the Addictions podcast I hope to achieve that. There are so many people who are struggling with addictions, and I feel that armed with the right knowledge many of them can rise above their addiction and reclaim their lives. Many addicts simply do not understand that help can be \u003cem\u003eeasier\u003c/em\u003e to get than they think. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 The Addictions podcast features informative stories and anecdotes from recovering and active addicts and their families. I try to cover as much ground as I can in each episode, from success stories to the nightmare that is relapse. I hope you can join us! And if you like what you hear maybe even support us! Patrons will have access to all sorts of swag including videos and music I make. And extra bonus audio. The podcast will always be free for everyone. I generally upload new episodes on a weekly basis. Thank you all in advance!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\tMy Story\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 In December of 2006 I was doing some shopping for an upcoming New Years Eve party. It was on my way home that evening that I was the victim of a terrible traffic accident that resulted in breaking my left femur. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 It was cold outside, but the weather was not bad, for December. I remember clearly that there was no snow on the ground yet. I was headed East at around 55 miles an hour when another driver heading the opposite direction lost control and crossed the center line. Before I could even think about reacting I slammed into the other vehicle.. I was wearing my seatbelt but my vehicle hit the other car with such an impact that I was thrown into the steering wheel of my car, breaking my left femur about six inches above the knee.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0\u00a0 I am very lucky to be alive and telling you my story. The accident could have been much worse. If I were not wearing my seatbelt I am positive that I would have been thrown through the front windshield. What followed was a major surgery to insert a titanium rod down \u003cem\u003einto\u003c/em\u003e my left femur to stabilize the bone and allow it to heal. I was able to go home two days after the surgery, but it took months and months to get back to the point where I could get around well enough to take care of myself.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Throughout the recovery period after my initial surgery I was on prescription pain medication. I started on Vicodin 750 milligrams. I took them as needed. I did not abuse them in \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e way. I was aware of that Vicodin was a narcotic and carried the possibility of abuse with it. After my prescription for Vicodin ran out I was then put on Ultram, and after that Darvocet, and then \u003cem\u003eback\u003c/em\u003e to the Vicodin. The reasoning from my orthopedic specialist\u0027s point of view was that this rotation of pain meds would help to lower the abuse potential that these drugs carried. I had absolutely zero issues with abuse or dependence during this period. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 About a year and a half later I began to notice SEVERE pain while bending over in a certain manner. One of the pins that held the titanium rod in place would catch on a tendon in my left hip. When this would happen it caused immense pain until I moved my leg around in the right way to free the stuck tendon. The solution to this issue was another surgery to \u003cem\u003eremove\u003c/em\u003e the titanium rod and pins holding it in place. My femur was fully healed by this time and the titanium rod was really no longer necessary. This surgery took a fraction of the time to do compared with the previous surgery to put the rod in. The recovery period was also shorter for this surgery, about two and a half months. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After the second surgery and several months of physical therapy, I began to notice other painful issues with my left leg and hip as well as my lower back on the left side. If I stood in one position too long, sat in the same position too long, or if I were to go on too long of a walk, I would get a burning type of pain in my left hip combined with a numbness and tingling that traveled down my left leg into my knee. The second thing was that along with the numb, burning pain in my left hip and leg I would also have some pretty terrible left lower back pain, radiating up from my left hip and buttocks.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\"\u003eThe Drugs\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 BOTH of these issues were quite troublesome to me so I began ongoing treatment with my family doctor, who almost instantly put me on Norco 7.5 milligrams, three times a day, or as needed. Again, I knew that these types of drugs carried the potential for addiction, but to be honest with you, I really did not understand addiction, drug tolerance, or that some addictions carried a physical withdrawal period associated with long-term use. My doctor failed to explain the perils of addiction to me in any real sense. These types of drugs did not honestly take the pain away, but they made the pain easier to tolerate. Little did I know that I was heading down a slippery slope, ever closer to physical dependence and psychological addiction.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After many x-rays and MRI scans, along with a few other tests, it was clear to both my family doctor and my pain specialist that my issues were being caused by a laceration of my sciatic nerve on my left side. This type of nerve damage is not uncommon in patients that have sustained the type of injury that I had. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Nerve pain is commonly referred to as neuropathic pain. My team of doctors first took the route of cortisone injections in my left hip area to see if it would alleviate some of the pain. To be perfectly honest I was all for \u003cem\u003eanything\u003c/em\u003e that held the potential of giving me some relief from the pain, but the cortisone injections simply did not provide. The next option was a procedure known as a rhizotomy to sever the nerve roots from the spinal cord and thus bypass the sciatic nerve completely. The nerve roots will grow back and the procedure will have to be repeated every six months. The problem was that I was not getting six months worth of pain relief from it. The procedure helped with my lower back pain for about a month but it did not help with any of the other pain I was having, and the rhizotomy can only be done once every six months, so it was not really a plausible solution for long-term pain relief.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 During this entire time I was being prescribed the Norco 7.5 milligram pills. In fact I had a prescription for them for over\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003efour\u003c/strong\u003e years. At first I was not abusing the pills. I would just go about my day and when I began to have pain I would take one. But after just a couple months of this one pill was not doing it any more and I would have to take two. I figured it was not a big deal. The dosage instructions said to take 1-2 pills, three times a day. Eventually I would begin to wake up feeling sick every morning until I took my morning Norco. It got to the point that I was running out of pills before I could get my prescription refilled at the end of each month. The first time I did not think anything of it and I called my doctor to see about having her send my refill to the pharmacy early, and it was not a problem. But the following month I did the same thing and to my surprise, my doctor seemed upset or annoyed that I was calling to get my pills early again, nevertheless, she refilled my prescription early. But boy was I in for a shock the following month.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 After a few more tests and failed treatments, I was diagnosed with spinal stenosis and sacroiliac joint dysfunction. Spinal stenosis alone can cause severe weakness and numbness that radiates from the lower back down through the legs and buttocks, especially when the patient is physically active. The sacroiliac joint is medical jargon for the hip joint. Dysfunction of this joint causes sever pain that also radiates down through the legs. These two conditions combined with a lacerated sciatic nerve make for a pretty rough time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 I got a letter in the mail. It was from my doctors office. I thought that it was kind of odd, as they rarely ever corresponded with me via snail mail. I opened the letter to find out that my doctor could no longer see me as a patient! I was devastated. It had taken me quite some time to find a doctor in the first place that would take the no-fault auto coverage as health insurance. I work on a farm in a small town and the money I make is generally spent before I even get it. Needless to say I was worried for several reasons.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 I was addicted to the opioid pain killers I had been eating for the past four and a half years. Plain and simple. After I lost my doctor and blew through the last of my prescription I decided to try to quit cold turkey. That was a mistake. I was so sick. Vomiting, nausea, feeling cold and clammy, sweats headache, and on top of all of that my normal leg, hip, and lower back pain. I could not do it. The withdrawal was too difficult. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 By the end of day two I was losing my mind. I began searching out anyone and I mean \u003cem\u003eanyone\u003c/em\u003e who would sell me drugs on the street. I found that without the aid of insurance covering the cost of my addiction that I no longer had enough money to pay my bills. By this time, I had actual health insurance for the first time thanks to the ACA, but I had not found a doctor yet and simply could not wait. I had to work, and in order to not be sick and be able to work and keep my job, I had to use drugs. So that is exactly what I did. I am ashamed to even say it, but it is the truth. \u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t \u00a0 \u00a0 I used for another year or so before finally learning about Suboxone, which is an opioid replacement therapy. You take the Suboxone in place of whatever opioid you were using before , be it Heroin or Hydrocodone. After you have been on it for a month or so your doctor begins to lower your dose bit by bit. Milligram by milligram. Until you are at such a low dose that you don\u0027t even notice when you forget to take it, and then... Eventually, you forget to take it permanently.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e"
