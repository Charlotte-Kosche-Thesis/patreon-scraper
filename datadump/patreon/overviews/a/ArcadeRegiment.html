    "summary": "My name is Phil English. I run the YouTube NHL channel \"Arcade Regiment\". I do NHL video game content, streams as well as a hockey based, on-camera video series such as \"Puck That\", an NHL highlights show), \"Power Rankings\" (Where I rank teams in the NHL) and \"A Hockey Moment\" (where I look at various hockey topics and moments of the past, present and future). I\u0027m turning to Patreon as a completely OPTIONAL way to support myself and my content monetarily. Your money would go into buying hockey cards, that I would be doing giveaways for and for upgrades to my mics, computer (which I do DESPERATELY need to upgrade) as well as more games/codes to giveaway. Basically, your money would go right back into the channel to deliver you more entertainment...hopefully.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking these shows are NOT easy. There\u0027s a bunch of time that goes into research, watching the games and EVERY graphic that you see was basically hand created. We make these shows as a labour of love for the game of hockey and will always love making content. However, love unfortunately cannot buy things. The mics costs money, along with editing software, graphics software, studio lights. It adds up after a while. This is ONLY meant for people who want to support monetarily. If you support by watching/sharing/subscribing than that is just as great. This is only for people who want to help improve the show EVEN more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere WILL NOT be a paywall for you to watch exclusive videos and you WILL NOT have to pay to have 1V1 NHL games or just to chat and talk on PSN or Discord because I want to be as accessible for FREE because I feel that being able to directly talk to a YouTuber/Content Creator SHOULD NOT be a thing you have to pay for.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI enjoy chatting with all my viewers. I call you all my friends and family because that is what YOU have become to me. I\u0027ve debated not even making this but some people wanted it and so now you have it. Even $1 means the world to me so if you want (not obligated) to donate to \"Arcade Regiment\", it would be humbly appreciated and I sincerely thank you for your time."

     "about": "Arcade Regiment\u0027s mission statement is \"Gaming entertainment at its finest\". It\u0027s the five words that go through my mind whenever we create a video. They are the words that drive me to edit for hours on end, script episodes of \"Throwback Thursday\", \"Pass or Play\" and \"Pick 3 with PGP\" at every moment I get. Long story short, I make those words my vow to entertain YOU, the viewer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith Arcade Regiment being just over a year old, we\u0027ve come from humble beginnings to create series\u0027 that thrive on interaction and viewer opinion. That\u0027s always been my interest, \"to create content to which every viewer can have their say\". Whether it\u0027s sharing your favourite Super Nintendo games or agreeing that Super Mario Strikers is a game worth playing, you always have a voice when it comes to Arcade Regiment video content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now offer you...power.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll still be getting frequent videos and streams on occasion but if you are gracious enough to donate, we will be offering various rewards from potential game choices for \"Pass or Play\" to topics for a \"Pick 3 with PGP\", you can even control what games I play in stream. Want to see how I edit my videos and maybe gain a perspective to what I do? That will be an option as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt all comes down to this. What ever money we humbly get through our Patrons, it will simply go BACK into more things for videos. Better mics, a RAM upgrade so I can pump out videos even faster, games to play and giveaway. Basically, if you become a Patron, we\u0027ll pay back in entertainment. It\u0027s as simple as that. So consider becoming a Patron to support us on our vow to deliver \"gaming entertainment at its finest\".",
