    "summary": "I\u0027m best known as an independent games developer who makes RPGs... but more than that, I\u0027m a person, and I imbue everything I make with my personality in some way or another. I make everything for a reason that resonates with me, and so I\u0027d like to tell you a bit about who I am and why I do what I do. I\u0027ll start at the beginning.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePoverty and neglect characterised my earliest years. A \u0027have not\u0027, I turned to \u003cstrong\u003ecreativity \u003c/strong\u003eto give some form of existence to things I wished I had, or to escape the difficulties of the real world I knew.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs I grew, I continued to create. I taught myself how to program, how to compose music, how to make websites, and I refined my existing drawing skills, through online tutorials and many solitary nights spent in intense practice.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI loved \u003cstrong\u003erole-playing games \u003c/strong\u003esuch as Final Fantasy - their immersive stories, characters and worlds - and so I tried to make my own, alone.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI succeeded, and released three episodes of an RPG series called \u003cstrong\u003eMARDEK\u003c/strong\u003e. This was several years ago, though I still hear praise about the positive impact they had on many peoples\u0027 lives.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve never been a businessman. I was used to being without, lacked confidence, and I didn\u0027t want to take from others... so I made next to no money from the success of those games.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, when I was about 19, my familiar neuroticism suddenly exploded into panic attacks, constant, intense anxiety, and despair... and at around the same time, for unrelated reasons, I moved country (the second time this had happened) and lost everyone I knew...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBurdened by intense anxiety and with no offline social connections, I felt unable to face the world. It seemed I didn\u0027t have to, though; I could continue to make games from my computer. So that\u0027s what I did.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt didn\u0027t go so well, though. The inner pain consumed me. I spent what should have been the best years of my life in a state of almost constant suffering, alone, unable to leave my house for months at a time. I worked on several games, but wasn\u0027t able to finish any of them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, at the beginning of 2015, I underwent a rather amazing inner shift which changed my outlook as if from black to white, overnight. It was as if I\u0027d taken off a pair of dark glasses, and saw the world for the first time in my life. Though my external circumstances hadn\u0027t changed, I spent months in a state of \u003cstrong\u003eblissful peace\u003c/strong\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began to see my games development not as a means of escaping or avoiding the world, but as a medium through which I could explore the nature of suffering and the shift in perceptions that brought such light to my life. \u0027What it means to be truly happy\u0027.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo my games are now about that. I pour my heart and passion into them, in the hope that they might make an impact in peoples\u0027 hearts, ideally allowing them to experience the same radical \u003cstrong\u003efreedom from suffering\u003c/strong\u003e that I\u0027ve found. I\u0027m not coldly producing a Product for profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently trying to do the jobs of several people and getting paid for none of them:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a Designer\u003c/strong\u003e. I design my games around concepts that I feel are meaningful or novel; I\u0027m not interested in making soulless clones of genres currently in vogue. I try to innovate, but in ways that personally appeal to \u003cem\u003eme\u003c/em\u003e rather than some imagined \u0027consumer\u0027. As such, I\u0027m driven by personal passion rather than the pursuit of profit.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a Programmer\u003c/strong\u003e. I program my games, which is a time-consuming technical ordeal.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a Writer\u003c/strong\u003e. I write their spiritual stories, populated by complex characters who each represent a facet of my own psychology or experiences. Everything and everyone I write resonates with me in some meaningful way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m an Artist\u003c/strong\u003e. I design, draw and animate all my games\u0027 stylised graphics, ensuring that the visual details of characters or the world reflect the story I know so deeply.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a Composer\u003c/strong\u003e. I compose all the music, interweaving leitmotifs with an understanding that comes from being the sole creator of the story, characters and world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a Webmaster\u003c/strong\u003e. I run the website that I personally built from scratch, \u003ca href=\"http://www.alorafane.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.alorafane.com\u003c/a\u003e: a close-knit community built on positive, encouraging interactions and a shared search for what it means to be happy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cstrong\u003eI\u0027m a Human\u003c/strong\u003e. I\u0027d like to make an audio or video journal about my thoughts relating to escaping suffering, the inspiration for my work, as well as my own personal journey of growth and realisation. And of course I have to pay for food and shelter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePledging even a small amount of money to me each month via Patreon will allow me to continue doing all of this without having to abandon my vision in order to work some irrelevant job just to pay the bills!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to support me, then thank you, and if my work can bring any kind of happiness into your life, then I think that that would be a wonderful thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e~\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://scraps.fighunter.com/mivss610.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy current project is an RPG series for mobiles; a complete reboot of the \u003cstrong\u003eMARDEK\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0series that I had success with in the past. While the original was a fairly standard RPG in a cookie-cutter fantasy world with few innovations, this reboot is far more uniquely mine.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt focuses on interpersonal relationships between the characters, and their inner psychology. Each seeks happiness and freedom from their own suffering - whether that\u0027s a tragic past, depression and anxiety, or simply the familiar stress of everyday life - and the story explores their attempts to find it; some successful, some not.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://scraps.fighunter.com/mivss604.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRather than violently slaughting random wildlife or goons for little reason - as is the norm is most games - instead the characters are beset by mental phantasms called \u0027miasmon\u0027, which are their own dark feelings given form. They \u003cem\u003etame\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0these miasmon - a constructive process, involving building positive rapport to reach an understanding, rather than robbing them of the life energy they already have - and can then summon them for their own use against other miasmon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCharacters\u0027 aptitude in these abstract emotional encounters is determined by their Myers-Briggs-inspired personality type rather than physically-oriented statistics such as strength or defence, meaning that nobody is inherently \u0027better\u0027 than anyone else; simply different. It\u0027s not about the accumulation of power or dominating enemies; it\u0027s about understanding fragments of yourself so then you may become more whole, more at peace with them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMechanically, it works just like any other RPG battle system, but I expect that the terminology (they\u0027re not called battles, they\u0027re called \u0027agitation\u0027, and you don\u0027t \u0027attack\u0027 your \u0027enemies\u0027 to \u0027defeat\u0027 them) will encourage people to see something familiar from a different angle. Not everything needs to be about violence, conflict and dominance, and I want to demonstrate that a fulfilling experience can be built on a different abstraction.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://scraps.fighunter.com/mivss615.png\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story is largely about a worldless god who comes to inhabit the empty head of a young man so as to bring happiness to his own forsaken world... but more than that abstract overarching plot, it\u0027s about the smaller interactions between the characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEach is driven by a dream and defined by a personal \u0027motto\u0027, which guides them to what they perceive to be happiness.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"I wish I were a warrior, instead of a worrier.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"A lone god\u0027s tear, I feel I long for deep blue depths where I\u0027ll belong.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Reason\u0027s mental metal makes minds immune to miasma and malice.\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour party of up to four characters can interact with one another at any time. Not only can the leader speak with his or her followers one by one, but those followers always have something to say to one another, too. This allows the story - and the player - to explore and develop bonds between \u003cem\u003eeveryone\u003c/em\u003e, which I for one find deeply fascinating.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe story will be told through many shortish episodes, which will be released whenever they\u0027re ready. I\u0027m trying my best, but I\u0027m only one person, so I hope you understand that. Each one follows a different party of characters, meaning that there will always be fresh relationships to explore as well as familiar ones. Even the protagonist changes between episodes; the story as a whole has several intertwined threads, each with its own meaning, value, and primary characters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read more about this game on \u003ca href=\"http://www.alorafane.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ewww.alorafane.com\u003c/a\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI look forward to telling the story of MARDEK over the next few years, and any financial support you can provide via Patreon will definitely help me to do that!\u003cbr\u003e"
