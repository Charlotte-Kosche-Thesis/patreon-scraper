My goal is write stuff that connects with people and that has a strong\npersonality. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI have a lot that I\nwant to share with the world, and I greatly desire to have an audience that\nlistens to what I have to say and discusses it with me. While not many have seen my writing at\nthis time, those who have often had very positive things to say. I generally am\na very self critical girl, and I don\u0027t hold myself in high regard. Writing,\nhowever, is one of the few things I I know for certain that I am good at, and thus it would be stupid of me to not try and capitalize on that.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nHowever, for me, this isn\u0027t simply a matter of typing up some words on a page\nand posting it as there is also a lot more to this. The reason I decided to\ncreate a Patreon account is so that I have more money to spend towards improving or expanding my site. If you would like to see informative and insightful yet also humorous reviews and coverage on niche games, then consider following Guardian Acorn, and donating to my blog if you have a game you\u0027d like me to review or like to support building a like minded community of fellow gamers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy blog can be found here. \u003ca href=\"https://guardianacorn.com/\"\u003ehttps://guardianacorn.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFurther details on how I plan to use Patreon can be found here... \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://guardianacorn.com/2017/12/20/guardian-acorn-patreon-overhaul-and-personal-update/\"\u003ehttps://guardianacorn.com/2017/12/20/guardian-acor...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "My name is Annie Gallagher, and this is my blog, Guardian Acorn. This blog is primarily focused on game reviews and coverage, but that is not solely what it is about\nas I occasionally talk about other subject matters such as anime or even\npolitics. Really, it is whatever I feel would be most appropriate as this blog\nis mainly an expression of myself. Regardless of what I am write about or\nmaking, my goal is write stuff that connects with people, and that has a strong\npersonality. I may have it listed as gaming, but this blog is really a\n\"me\" blog.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSo the question is, what makes me so special? Well, I simply have a lot that I\nwant to share with the world, and I greatly desire to have an audience that\nlistens to what I have to say and discusses it with me. I want to feel like\nwhat I say matters, and not be ignored. While not many have seen my writing at\nthis time, those who have often had very positive things to say. I generally am\na very self critical girl, and I don\u0027t hold myself in high regard. Writing,\nhowever, is one of the few things I I know I am good at, and I feel as though\nwriting is the only thing I could do for a career.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThe reason I decided to\ncreate a Patreon account is so that I have more money to spend towards content\ncreation, as I am still a jobless college student with severe social anxiety\nand possible agoraphobia. Some examples of things that pledges would go towards\nthe paid plans on Wordpress, which gives me access to more features, which\nenhances presentation of the writing greatly. It also will allow my blog to be\nfound by a lot more people, and also for me to profit from the blog itself.\nWhile writing is important to me and I would still do it even if I I received no compensation or had no audience, the frequency and quality of my work would not be nearly as high as they could be. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf one was not aware, I am a trans woman, and despite the fact that I am on hormone replacement therapy, my mental state has not escaped the preceding years unscathed. I have already mentioned social anxiety/fear and agoraphobia, both of which are a major hindrance on me. In addition to the death of my mother back in 2013, and along with the fact that I have aspergers, I have so far only been able to attend a few college part time, and even needed to take a year off because dysphoria got so bad I couldn\u0027t stand to be out in public. Additionally, I find myself being too scared to get a job for similar reasons. My dad still provides for me and works hard as a single father, and even pays for my HRT, and I greatly appreciate him for that, even though he hasn\u0027t been as supportive as I needed to be (which thankfully, I had several people I have known online that helped there). \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have already been writing online articles since 2013 on my Deviantart account, and have written for both Oprainfall.com and Brash Games briefly. I have over 125 reviews submitted on GameFAQs, 12 of which were review of the month winners, so I am hardly new to writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs such, the reason I am creating an account isn\u0027t just me trying to get free money, but rather so I have access to better resources that can improve my content. My ideal goal is to turn my site into a paid career, so that I can put as much into creating quality content as I can. Unfortunately, I do not have that yet, so I am trying to use Patreon as a springboard so I can afford the features that will kickstart the growth of my site until I establish enough of a readership that I can make a profit. Regardless, my main focus is making sure that I give back to everyone who donates by creating the best content possible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I am hoping that Guardian Acorn has a bright future and I am infinitely grateful to anyone who supports me. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.\u003cbr\u003e",
