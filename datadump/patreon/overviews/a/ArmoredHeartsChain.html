They are a threefold philosophy:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFirst, Discovery: I\u0027d love to help more people discover the art of Chainmaille. Whether it\u0027s introducing someone to the History of chainmaille armor, to applications in Modern films, or practical use, (Yes, people use chainmaille armor for practical reasons), Fashion or fun. Learning is a wonderful thing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSecondly, Enjoyment: Enjoying art is something that is learned. If you enjoy art as decor, buy some and start a collection. If you enjoy art by trying to create; buy a kit or take a class and make something. If you enjoy art by making it possible for someone, like me, to continue offering opportunities to own and try making chainmaille, become my Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd Last, but never least; Education: Learning the Who, When, Where, How and Why is exciting and helps make sense of the world we live in. Cultures teach their members and others the answers to these questions and people thrive on learning and the progression of their communities. I\u0027ve been teaching for 7 years. I\u0027m always learning new aspects of this lost Art. In my Patrons only Updates, I\u0027ll share with you what I\u0027ve learned and what makes chainmaille one of my deepest passions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery evolving is my skill set and my goals to take chainmaille from the things of legend: Movies and Ren Fair fame, to wearable art, functional decor and finally apparel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eJewelry is a quick fix to share with others the intricacy of chainmaille. I love making jewelry to sell and gift to others. But I want to take it further. Having a piece or collection of items for home decor is a way to appreciate this artform. Wearing elaborate pieces of chainmaille and scalemaille clothing is a fantastic way to express your passion for unique, handmade items.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support allows me to create, design and share all of these and more. I hope to branch out into live streaming videos to instruct, inform, introduce and inspire you to explore the world of Chainmaille."

     "description": "Scales? Of Metal? You bet.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScalemaille, simply put is the process of using a piece of metal that\u0027s punched from a sheet with a hole. Using this in replacement of a ring creates a material or skin of scales. Much like a dragon or lizard. Even a fish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eScales come in different materials and colors. For this goal I\u0027d like to focus on Anodized Aluminum.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to purchase raw aluminum scales and prepare them for color. Anodizing is the process of using dye and electrical current to oxidize the surface and create a rainbow of colors.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThis process is costly and time consuming, I\u0027ll tumble the scales and send them to a shop that specializes in anodization. The colors are amazing!",

     "description": "You can\u0027t make chainmaille jewelry without rings. Meeting this goal will allow me to have a good basic stock of rings I use most. Certain colors of Anodized aluminum rings are a must. Stainless rings are prefered by men and those who prefer a more edgy style. Until I can set up the equipment to make my own Bright aluminum rings, I need a good stock of rings to make the shiny items you see on my Facebook page and in my Etsy shop. They are the core of a chainmailler\u0027s arsenal. Having a great inventory ensures my ability to make the rewards you win as part of your Patronage. Like tools, they are most important asset; other than the skill I am always developing.",
