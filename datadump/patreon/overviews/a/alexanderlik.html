I also try to redistribute in turn as much as I can, especially when I have money left over. While the majority of the resources I give away go to individual fundraisers or friends in need, I also try to donate to other Patreon accounts; you should be able to see who I\u0027m currently supporting on my profile!\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003ch3\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy You Should Support Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tIt\u0027s not my place to say whether or not your money ought to be sent to me.

Because I am already sending some of my Patreon earnings right back to other creators I have decided to formally contribute a portion of my earnings at every reward tier to other deserving Patreon accounts. This also allows me to promote other Patreon campaigns right on my profile; while Patreon does not publicly display the amount of money I give to other Patreon accounts, you should be able to see which Patreon accounts I contribute to and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.

I will be able to produce more for you as I will also be able to invest some money into my work including buying new and improved equipment such as a new computer, cameras for photography and video projects, and more. At this stage I will really be able to operate creatively and launch a number of projects I can only plan for now.",
