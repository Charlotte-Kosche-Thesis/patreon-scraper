    "summary": "\u003ch1\u003eWelcome!\u003c/h1\u003eFirst of all, THANK YOU for stopping by to check out my Patreon page. The fact that you even came here to check it out means a lot to me. For those of you who don\u2019t know me, I\u0027ve been writing, recording and performing rock music for over 20 years and I still have a hard time believing that I\u0027ve come this far. To date, I\u0027ve released five albums through various projects over the years, and have played over 500 shows either solo or with a band. Weird thing is, being in a band never even crossed my mind until I was actually in one\u2026 Performance for me has always been more of an exercise in conquering my fears. I got my first guitar when I was 12, and started putting poems to music pretty much right away, but I was so self conscious about my voice that there was no fucking way I was going to actually perform those songs for anyone! Fast forward several years and I was really starting to get tired of being so afraid of it, I mean what was the WORST thing that could possibly happen? So, I started to force myself to play in front of people. I chose specific people (people who I thought were \u201csafe\u201d) and after performing an original song for a close friend who was starting up his own band, he invited me to be in it. I couldn\u2019t believe it. Me. In. A. Band. Wut?! I have been unable to quit ever since.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/h1\u003ePatreon is a subscription based platform that allows fans to directly support my musical endeavors. Think of this as being my own private record label and you\u2019re an investor in my product. If you like the music I make and want to support me in creating more of it, this is the place to do it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eHow does it work?\u003c/h1\u003eYou pledge an amount that you\u2019re comfortable with (trust me, even $1 makes a huge difference!), and then I get busy creating the \u201cthings\u201d. I plan to create one to two things per month. My goal is to is to be able to take the songs that you like the best and take those into the studio to make them all shiny by adding electric guitars, backing vocals, bass guitar, drums, and who knows what else. The more $ I have in the budget the more I can do with the songs. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhy am I here?\u003c/h1\u003eI want to release new music in 2018. It\u2019s been two years since the release of the \u201cBlack Roses\u201d EP and I have a bunch of new songs that I want to take into the studio with a band and release into the world, but I need your help. I\u2019m certain I don\u2019t have to tell you this, but studios and producers and musicians all need to pay their bills I can\u2019t get my babies into the world without the help of these professionals. But I also want to release music that people actually want to hear. Enter Patreon. A platform where I can share my creations with people who actually want to listen, and who will provide me with genuine feedback about the material. I chose Patreon instead of doing a Kickstarter style campaign because those services are one and done kinds of services, and I want this to be an ongoing thing. Music is a part of my life and I want to share that journey with you, for as long as you want to be a part of it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003e\u003c/h3\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for you?\u003c/h1\u003eBesides directly funding my musical efforts, as a Patron you also get special exclusive rewards that no one else will receive. Check out the Rewards section on the right to see the full gamut of what I am offering for each pledge tier. You don\u2019t have to stick to those numbers either. If you want to pledge $2 or $2000 you can do that when you sign up, just put in the amount you want to pledge and you\u2019ll fall into the appropriate tier. Some example rewards are hearing songs in their most raw format before anyone else, special discounts on merch, guitar chord charts with lyrics, private concerts, and much more. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch1\u003eWhat have you made so far?\u00a0\u003c/h1\u003eHere are some couple examples of songs I\u0027ve released into the world.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Stay\" from my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-roses-ep/1052046506\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBlack Roses\u003c/a\u003e album\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rKxiX4ND7bQ\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"You Rescued Me\" also\u00a0from my \u003ca href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/black-roses-ep/1052046506\"\u003eBlack Roses\u003c/a\u003e album\u00a0\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gnwmq_QaNXU\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also make lyric books, guitar pick jewelry, digital prints..
