    "summary": "Hi! \u00a0I\u0027m Austin Coppock, and I love writing about astrology. \u00a0I get a singular pleasure out of mapping the strange times in which we live. I\u0027ve written annual Astrological Almanacs for the last 5 years and I wrote a weekly horoscope column for 8 years. \u00a0I\u0027d like to bring both of these formats together, and write all of the daily, weekly, monthly and yearly content included in each. \u00a0In addition, I\u0027d like it be free,\ntoo.   \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eLet\u2019s call this fever dream the Online Almanac Project.  Or, if you prefer- Ye Olde Online Almanack Project. \u00a0The plan is to cover every angle of time as it\nunfolds, from the granularity of daily analysis to the grand vistas of epochal overviews.  It\u2019s a cathedral-sized\ndream, so I\u2019m going to be starting with the chipped and scarred cornerstone of any\nsuch effort- the weekly horoscope column. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eBy supporting me through Patreon, you\u2019ll enable me to spend\nthe time and energy necessary to build on the weekly column and add monthlies, dailies, special essays and\nmore. \u00a0You\u0027ll also help keep my work independent, and provide me the platform to call it exactly as I see it. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat is Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows writers, like myself, to receive regular\ndonations for the work they put out.  It\u2019s\nsort of like Kickstarter, but not. \nInstead of a large one-time lump, you toss me a handful nickels for each piece\nI craft. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThe greater the donations, the more time I can spend mapping\nout the astrology of our times.  Ideally,\nI\u2019d like to be putting out work that covers daily, weekly and monthly time frames, mapping the changing situation from all three of these important and distinct angles. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Does it Work?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003ePatreon lets you volunteer to\ndonate whatever amount you want on a per post basis. Each time I release a new\nepisode you volunteer to donate $1, $3 or whatever you want. It\u2019s your\ncall.  Initially, I\u2019ll be\nreleasing one column per week, which works out to 4 or 5 posts a month.  Eventually, if the goals are met, I\u2019d like to\nadd a monthly piece, and a month worth of dailies, which will be posted as one\npiece on the first day of every month.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eWhen you subscribe you will be charged at the end of each\nmonth based on the number of pieces I released that month. You can also set a\nmaximum monthly amount so that you won\u2019t get charged more than that amount\nin a given month, just in case the spirit moves and a release a slew of pieces. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\n\nBenefits of Becoming a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThe column itself will remain free, but there are some\nongoing rewards and benefits that are only available to patrons, such as access\nto a private Facebook discussion forum, a live monthly transit discussion and early access. You can find out more about the different reward tiers at the\nbottom of this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI also have some specific milestone goals that are listed on\nthe left side of this page, which describe the full scope of what I\u2019d like to\ndo.  \u003cbr\u003e\n\n---\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you\u2019d like to see me provide the most comprehensive,\nuseful and entertaining astrological coverage possible, support the project by\nbecoming my patron! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e"
