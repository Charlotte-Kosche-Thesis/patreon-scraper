So, each time I release a new episode you volunteer to donate $1, or $2, or $3 or whatever you want.  My goal is to release one episode a week, or in other words four episodes a month. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen you subscribe you will be charged at the end of each month based on the number of episodes I released that month.  You can also set a maximum monthly amount so that you won\u2019t get charged more than a certain amount in a given month.  \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBenefits of Becoming a Patron\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe podcast itself will continue to remain free, but there are some ongoing rewards and benefits that are only available to patrons, such as access to a private Facebook discussion forum, early access to new episodes, higher quality recordings, and more. You can find out more about the different reward tiers on the sidebar on this page. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also have some specific milestone goals that are listed on the sidebar as well, which are specific ways in which the podcast will be improved or expanded once we reach certain funding goals. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e---\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you love the show and want me to keep doing it then please show your support by becoming a patron!\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
