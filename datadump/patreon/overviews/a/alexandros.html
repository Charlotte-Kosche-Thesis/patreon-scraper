This is buying the spiritual equivalent of a painkiller. In fact, it is the very antithesis of philosophy since what you\u2019re doing is not questioning yourself and your actions but rather trying to look for something that caters to your pre-existing needs and worldview.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nSome people believe that producing little videos about what some philosopher said is doing philosophy. It is not. That\u2019s merely popularizing philosophical information, it is not \u003ca href=\"http://alexandros.is/what-is-philosophy-3/\"\u003edoing philosophy\u003c/a\u003e. While this practice definitely has value we should not confuse the two. Making a video talking about martial arts does not make you a martial artist. Nor does watching it. Publishing this piece of text does not make me a philosopher either.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBecause philosophy is not a \u003cem\u003eproduct\u003c/em\u003e but an \u003cem\u003eactivity\u003c/em\u003e. The result of it may be writings, videos etc. But let\u2019s not confuse the act of love with the children it may produce as a result. Unfortunately the word tends to be used as a noun, as in someone having a \u201ca philosophy\u201d and people forget that it also refers to an activity, as captured by the verb to \u003cem\u003ephilosophize\u003c/em\u003e. Philosophies are just, at best, more systematic opinions, and opinions are like\u2026well, you know\u2026everybody has one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPhilosophical activity is something entirely different. Though it has no solid content, no ready-made \u201csolution\u201d to offer your aching soul, it does offer something else. It offers you the exercise your soul needs to get off the couch and walk again after being fed too many \u201cchicken soups of the soul\u201d (this refers to the famous new agey collection of platitudes offering guidance published under the same title).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nJust like physical exercise, there are good and bad ways of doing it. You can do it alone, and engage in the soul\u2019s conversation with itself, to use an expression from Plato\u2019s \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theaetetus_(dialogue)\"\u003eTheaetetus\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, or you can do it with others, and engage in \u003cem\u003esymphilosophein\u003c/em\u003e, as Aristotle would call it. You can do it in the spirit of \u003cem\u003eantagonismos\u003c/em\u003e (against another) or \u003cem\u003esynagonismos\u003c/em\u003e (with another for a common purpose, see \u003ca href=\"http://alexandros.is/dare-to-be-wise/\"\u003eDare to be wise\u003c/a\u003e for a detailed explanation of the difference.).\u00a0Done wrongly, it may spiral down to senseless hostility towards oneself and others. You can cause injury without any benefit. That is why Plato cautioned against the misuse of philosophical techniques, like dialectics, and required its participants to have acquired a certain maturity before practicing them, advocating the ethic of dialogue. As I have pointed out in another post:\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\n\tThough dialectics was not staged as a confrontation it was still a type of \u201ccombat, amicable but real\u201d (P. Hadot, \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/21m6gSq\"\u003ePhilosophy as a Way of Life\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e, p.91, Blackwell, 1995)\u00a0of willing participants in a climate of gentleness and under the ethics of dialogue that consisted in understanding that:\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201cA true dialogue is possible only if the interlocutors want to dialogue. Thanks to this agreement between the interlocutors, which is renewed at each stage of the discussion, neither one of the interlocutors imposes his truth upon the other. On the contrary, dialogue teaches them to put themselves in each other\u2019s place and thereby transcend their own point of view. By dint of a sincere effort, the interlocutors discover by themselves, and within themselves, a truth which is independent of them, insofar as they submit to the superior authority of the logos. Here, as in all ancient philosophy, philosophy consists in the movement by which the individual transcends himself toward something which lies beyond him. For Plato, this something was the logos: discourse which implies the demands of rationality and universality. This logos, more\u00ad over, did not represent a kind of absolute knowledge; instead, it was equivalent to the agreement which is established between interlocutors who are brought to admit certain positions in common, and by this agreement transcend their particular points of view.\u201d (P. Hadot, \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/1PTRvCm\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is Ancient Philosophy?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, p.63, Harvard University Press, 2004)\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\tAt this point it may be worth to remember that the love of wisdom properly followed leads from the particular to the universal, so the exercise of Platonic dialectics is essentially an exercise of love, where the interlocutors help one another give birth to truths that go beyond themselves. This was not mere discourse but\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\u201c\u2026a \u201cform of life\u201d (to use J. Mittel\u00adstrass\u2019 expression) which was practiced by the interlocutors; for insofar as, in the act of dialoguing, they posited themselves as subjects but also transcended themselves, they experienced the logos which transcends them. Moreover, they also experienced that love of the good which is presupposed by every attempt at dialogue. From this perspective, the object of the discussion and its doctrinal content are of secondary importance. What counts is the practice of dialogue, and the transformation which it brings. Sometimes, the function of dialogue can even be to run into aporia [the Greek word for impasse], and thus to reveal the limits of language \u2013 its occasional inability to communicate moral and existential experience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\tUltimately, to use the expression of Luc Brisson, what mattered was \u201clearning to live in a philosophical way;\u201d with a common will to carry out disinterested research and in deliberate opposition to sophistic mercantilism. This was already a choice of life. To live in a philosophical way meant, above all, to turn toward intellectual and spiritual life, carrying out a conversion which involved \u201cthe whole soul\u201d \u2013 which is to say, the whole of moral life. For Plato, science and knowledge are never purely theoretical and abstract knowledge, which could be placed \u201cready-made\u201d within the soul. When Socrates said that virtue is knowledge, he was not using \u201cknowledge\u201d to mean pure, abstract knowledge of the good. Rather, he meant knowledge which chooses and wants the good\u00ad, in other words, an inner disposition in which thought, will, and desire are one.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t[\u2026] The philosopher\u2019s entire role will therefore consist in permitting his interlocutor to \u201crealize\u201d in the strongest sense of the word, what the true good is and what true value is.\u201d (P. Hadot, \u003ca href=\"http://amzn.to/1PTRvCm\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is Ancient Philosophy?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, p.63, Harvard University Press, 2004)\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nPhilosophical activity done right can lead to profound insight and transformation, a lifelong love for wisdom, and the communal rejoicing of those who seek it, the Aristotelian \u003cem\u003esyneu\u014dcheisthai \u003c/em\u003e(examined at \u003cem\u003eEudemian Ethics\u003c/em\u003e, VII.12, 1245b4\u20135).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor Plato it went as far as being a kind of transcendental love, which is where we get the expression Platonic Love from, though nowadays it has lost much of its original meaning (See my \u003ca href=\"http://alexandros.is/what-is-philosophy-2/\"\u003e\u201cWhat is Philosophy? Part 2: Philosopher: Lover of Wisdom\u201d\u003c/a\u003e to get a better understanding of that original meaning and read Plato\u2019s \u003cem\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_(Plato)\"\u003eSymposium\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is engaging in \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e aspect of philosophy that takes you closer to being a philosopher (though that\u2019s a necessary but not a sufficient condition to merit the title. Read what\u2019s under the \u003ca href=\"http://alexandros.is/tag/what-is-philosophy/\"\u003eWhat is Philosophy? tag\u003c/a\u003e to understand what I mean. You can start with the Introduction in \u003ca href=\"http://alexandros.is/philosophy/\"\u003ePhilosophy\u003c/a\u003e, then read the remaining posts under that tag and end with \u003ca href=\"http://alexandros.is/dare-to-be-wise/\"\u003eDare to be wise\u003c/a\u003e, to fully realize what it takes).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIt is \u003cem\u003ethat\u003c/em\u003e which I want to explore with others, not merely exchange philosophical recipes, but learn to cook the marrow of life in the fire of wisdom!\u00a0Doing that can be scary. That\u2019s why I always felt that the archetypical motto of philosophy should always be what echoed from antiquity (see Horace, \u003cem\u003eEpistles\u003c/em\u003e, Book 1, Epistle 2)\u00a0all the way to the enlightenment\u00a0(see Kant\u2019s \u003ca href=\"http://www.artoftheory.com/what-is-enlightenment_immanuel-kant/\"\u003efamous essay\u003c/a\u003e):\u00a0\u003cem\u003eSapere Aude!\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://alexandros.is/dare-to-be-wise/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eDare to be wise!\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nBut you don\u2019t have to dare alone.
