Through listening to another podcast a joke about the three of us doing a podcast together spiralled into a reality\u2014over 250 episodes later, here we are. Despite living on three different continents with a combined time difference of eighteen hours, we\u0027ve managed to all get together at the same time every week to do a podcast for you all.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince we started this show in April of 2012, we\u0027ve graduated University, got and lost jobs, had families, bought houses...life has changed a lot!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe\u0027re hugely grateful for all the support you\u0027ve given us in the past two years, but the truth is the podcast costs money. We\u0027ve tried advertising in the past but really, it\u0027s never fit our show. And who wants to advertise with us pricks anyway?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo instead, we\u0027re launching a Patreon page. Don\u0027t worry - the weekly podcast will always be completely free, we\u0027ve no intention of changing that. However if you like the podcast and want to support what we do, consider giving even a dollar a month to support the show. It helps to pay for the costs of the show, and the time it takes to keep doing it. It also pays for subscription services like FloSlam and the WWE Network, so we can review those shows for you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for reading.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCallum, Greg, Tommy and Mike\u003cbr\u003eAnswering The Ten Count"
