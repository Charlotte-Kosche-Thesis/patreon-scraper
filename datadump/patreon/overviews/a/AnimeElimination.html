    "summary": "I\u0027m a man who loves anime. I love it so much in fact that I hate wasting my time on generic, substandard crap, but there are about 140 new anime produced every year. That\u0027s about 820 hours of potential entertainment, but only about 16% of it is even worth looking at. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSure, you can try to go it alone, but at some point, don\u0027t you get tired of playing guessing games on Crunchyroll? Haven\u0027t you been misled enough by hipsters and hype-train enthusiasts? Aren\u0027t you sick of your one friend telling you how, \"No no. \u003cstrong\u003eThis\u003c/strong\u003e reverse-harem/battle girl/slice-of-life comedy/grimdark mecha anime is good. It\u0027s different, you just need to give it 8 episodes to get better,\" only to have it never actually get better? \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLeveraging years of anime viewing experience and knowledge of anime industry trends, I can save you hours upon hours of wasted time by separating the cream from the crap. \u00a0In Anime Elimination, each new anime has three episodes to impress and using that opening arc, I can extrapolate the direction of any given show\u0027s plot in addition to determining the quality of its visuals, writing, pacing, and animation. What you get is a clear and honest recommendation in the form of a pass or fail rating. No IGN 8.4\u0027s or wishy-washy \"but fans of garbage may like this show\" nonsense, no wannabe MST3k riffing, and no angry critic routine. What matters is the show\u0027s plot, it\u0027s notable strengths and flaws, and the pass/fail verdict. Also, when it\u0027s useful, I\u0027ll discuss a given series in relation to the bigger picture of a genre, animation studio, or director.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome amount of Anime Elimination is going to get made no matter what, after all it\u0027s my passion, but I only have so much time to devote to this project. Your contributions will not only enable me to produce more episodes every month, but also to improve the quality of each new episode and start producing longer-form anime reviews.\u003cbr\u003e"
