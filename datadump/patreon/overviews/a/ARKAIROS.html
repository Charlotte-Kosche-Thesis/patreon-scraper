It is not a luxury. It is our birthright as beings who can design, build and transform ourselves and our abodes at will. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt times the human condition is an embarrassment of failures. At other times life is a series of triumphs. Some blame nature and some blame nurture but even when we have it all, it often takes a decade of practice to master those skills and complete those projects we aim for. Most of us will move our homes at least once during these formative years and this is highly disruptive! Without custom architecture to rely on, many of our passions will sink into the ignominy of idle pastimes. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTragically, only a few of us manage to acquire suitably custom architecture before the end of our careers, which is literally putting the cart before the horse! Architecture should provide agency but all too often it shackles us with debt, lacks the security and spaciousness we really need and just when we\u2019ve finally organized our infrastructure into something worthy of the name architecture, it gets taken from us by storms, states or acts of God.  We all require an architecture that can withstand nature\u0027s storms, evolve and move with us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCreating durable custom architecture for keeps is also an ecological imperative. The construction industry is the most wasteful and polluting of them all. Even military adventurism is less damaging to the planet than the Juggernaut of real-estate development! For the sake of global ecology and skillful living, each of us require sturdy and transformable architecture of our own. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo aquire this, we need Denizenry -- the skills and artifacts of organic architecture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Way\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/26991208_1517628998.7214_funddescription.png\" style=\"width: 473px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZk--The Element of Design\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZk ushers in a new era of morphological architecture (architecture that adapts to life\u2019s changes.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eZk is the Denizenry Kit and Denizenry is a logical extension of the tradition established by Macintosh, Frank Lloyd Wright, Le Corbusier and Antonio Gaudi, among many others.  All agree that a thriving ecology is necessary for both \u2018the good life\u2019 and for a healthy, abundant, beautiful  and resilient planet. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine if as a child you were given a modeling kit called MAKS\u2014the Morphological Architecture Kit. With MAKS you create miniatures of your ideal furnishings and then gradually and forgivingly build full size versions. Your first kit could develop into a studio set and then into a tiny hut or even a houseboat. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver time your kit will integrate secure space for new works of art, equipment, heirloom furnishings and delicate treasures. Security and gradations of privacy remodels can change with the seasons. Your kit could grow into a schooner and a community could build a cluster of apartments with the Zk homes they gradually bring together. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://d2g8igdw686xgo.cloudfront.net/26991208_1517628240.2416_funddescription.png\" style=\"width: 473px; color: rgb(102, 102, 102);\" width=\"100%\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFine architecture is an art that deserves personal attention even if we think of ourselves as untalented in this regard.
