There\u0027s almost a God-like quality to it\u2014creating people and places and\nentire universes that never would have been. So maybe at the root of it I\u0027m\nstill just a little girl escaping into her own version of Wonderland.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eContent\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027ve\nalways had a realistic outlook on life. Many of the stories I write aren\u0027t the\nkind to give you a warm and fuzzy feeling. There isn\u0027t always a happy ending\nwith a pretty sunset. On the other hand, sometimes there is. And it\u0027s\nabsolutely breathtaking, isn\u0027t it? \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI like\nstories about the office worker, the cashier at the local convenience store,\nsometimes even the rich dude who lives alone in the big house up the block. The\nEveryman, if you will (shout out to high school English).\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m no\nSuperman, and I\u0027m quite sure none of you are either.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSchedule\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nLike I\nsaid, I\u2019m fresh outta college. I ain\u2019t got no \u0026lt;s\u0026gt;time fo dat\u0026lt;/s\u0026gt; money. I want\na sample before I spend my hard earned cash! There is A PUBLIC (read:\nFREE) SHORT STORY for your viewing pleasure. I will post one short story and one\ndrabble (less than 500 words) each month for all patrons. $3 patrons will get an additional short story each month. Please see my goals to see how you can support additional content.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI dream of sharing my work, which is a part of myself, with others so that we can all enjoy. I want to see a book that I wrote sitting proudly in a bookstore. Patreon is the first (and perhaps last, who\nknows) step towards that. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u0027m forever\nthankful for your patronage.\u003cbr\u003e"
