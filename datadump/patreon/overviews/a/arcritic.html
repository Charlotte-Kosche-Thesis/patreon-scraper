    "summary": "Hi, I am the creator and editor of arcritic.com. I\u0027ve created this website because I have a big passion for technology and more specifically, for Augmented Reality. I am passionate about sharing my enthusiasm\u00a0about this topic and enjoying writing very in-depth and honest reviews about AR games and apps.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI currently own only an iPad (2017) which I use to test the game and apps. I opened a patron page because my base income doesn\u0027t allow me to achieve my goals for the website. My goals are to cover all the noticeable AR titles out there, create commentated video reviews (currently I only share gameplay videos on my YouTube channel), and also purchase an ARKit-compatible iPhone and ARCore-compatible Android phone so I can cover the titles on both platforms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I started the website, I gave it a strong push so you can see what I am aiming for, what are my capabilities and know that your support will be directly aimed towards bringing my website visitors more interesting and engaging content that they will enjoy seeing and reading.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI spend sometimes hours on a single review if a specific app or game is really interesting and I want to share more information about it. I am a single person managing the site and therefore without your support, it will be hard for me to be able to deliver great content in a timely manner.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also do the design, the banners, the video editing, writing the reviews, managing the hosting service and everything that is needed to things happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will definitely\u00a0won\u0027t go unnoticed and it will be rejected directly on the\u00a0quality content that you\u0027ll see on my site.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor everyone who decides to support arcritic.com, thank you from the bottom of my heart, your support is everything to me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eARCritic.com founder."
