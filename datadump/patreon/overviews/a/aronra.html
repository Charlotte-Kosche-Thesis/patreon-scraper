    "summary": "For the past several years, I\u0027ve been an increasingly motivated activist, trying to affect positive change. I want to promote science specifically and education in general, and I\u0027ve found that videos are the best way I can do that.\u00a0 I can reach the grass roots audience I\u0027m aiming for, and give them the edge in their next argument over science vs religious extremism. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe purposeful propagation of misinformation is a multimillion-dollar business offering a lot of political power, percs, and prestige. To my experience, that begins with the denigration of science in favor of creationism and other pseudoscientific woo.\u00a0 I think if people know better, they\u0027ll vote better. My opposition knows that too; that\u0027s why they do what they do.\u00a0 That\u0027s why this is especially important here in the southern states; where science and education are both under specific attack from every level of politics and constituency.\u00a0 I do what I do, not to promote myself, but because something needs to be done, and I need to do something.\u00a0 I\u0027ve also gotten a great many supportive emails and private messages over the years, encouraging me to keep going, because it is making a difference.\u00a0 So I\u0027m going to keep going somehow.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI prefer to make educational science videos that are entertaining and informative, and which appeal to people who aren\u0027t scientists themselves.\u00a0 These require a substantial investment of time as well as money, and thanks to those that already support them.\u00a0 I also want to continue doing classroom appropriate explanations of common core science standards relating to evolution.\u00a0 These are topics which most people have been mislead to misunderstand, and which many teachers find difficult to teach.\u00a0 My wife is a science teacher and a curriculum specialist with the Next Generation Science Standards who has a hands-on perspective as to how to help these teachers.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have other projects too, relating to my secular activism -with presentations, protests, and appearances all over the country and occasionally abroad.\u00a0 I\u0027m usually out-of-pocket for most everything I do.\u00a0 I used to work a dead-end job at a soulless corporation in order to fund my passion, but honestly, that alone barely covered the monthlies. I even told my boss once that my job interfered with my work, which is true. \u00a0But thanks to patrons, I have been making more videos and reaching a wider audience instead. \u00a0I like to make information-rich videos which require many hours of research and a lot of editing.\u00a0 Anything else I want to do requires time off to travel.\u00a0 I try to do it cheap, but I can\u0027t afford what I\u0027m already doing.\u00a0 I want to make more valuable content and be more involved, but the costs are such that I often have to stand back in silent rage.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks to continued support, my channel now produces more different types of freethought content than most. But I can do a lot more with the help of supportive patrons.\u00a0 So, if you donate...\u003cbr\u003e- Pledges are per video- You can cap your monthly amount\u003cdiv\u003e- I will release 2 videos per month on average, but thanks to viewer support\u00a0my output has increased to at least 4 videos per month, of different types, documentary, science classroom supplements, presentation, vlog, podcast, etc. \u00a0I prefer quality over quantity.\u00a0 I want the content to be useful.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"

     "about": "Aron Ra is a Youtuber and an advocate for rationalism in science classrooms. He grew up in an exclusively creationist environment where he felt like a lonely outcast just for understanding evolution, let alone accepting it. \u00a0He was drawn into activism when the Religious Right dominated his state\u0027s Board of Education, and began undermining education in history, health, science, and social studies. His videos often focus on evolution and the evidence indicating an interrelated tree of life. His series summarizing the \u0027Foundational Falsehoods of Creationism\u0027 and his subsequent series, \u0027Falsifying Phylogeny\u0027 (including the Phylogeny Challenge\u0027) have been mirrored, featured, referenced, and recommended by many professional scientists, secularists, and educators, and has attracted more than 100,000 subscribers to his YouTube channel",
