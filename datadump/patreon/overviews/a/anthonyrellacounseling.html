    "summary": "I am a mental health therapist, writer, and spiritual seeker who has a passion for helping us all to become more whole and more courageous in living our lives. In my private practice, I specialize in helping men and masculine folk cultivate emotional intimacy and integrity in relationships. I also support LGBQ people in all their journeys, and trans folk in their transition and living. One deep passion I have is supporting spiritual practitioners and seekers develop integrated, thriving, connected lives and communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy first love was fiction and poetry writing, and I have used that in my work of blogging contemplative writings for personal and relationship growth. I have begun branching into creating recorded meditations, publishing exercises, and other media for the wider community. I am so thankful for those who have shared my work and let me know how that work has been supportive to them. I cannot be a therapist to everyone, but I can offer some of my work to you."
