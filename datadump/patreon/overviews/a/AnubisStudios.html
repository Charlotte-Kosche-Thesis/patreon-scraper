Welcome to Anubis Studios\u0027 Patreon page!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am a plush artist in the United States that primarily focuses in the Pokemon fandom. You may have heard of me on various Pokemon merchandise collecting groups, on DeviantArt, or on Facebook. I started creating plush through my collecting, and was part of gift exchanges where I decided one day to try plush making as a portion of the gift. I\u0027ve been making plush since the Spring of 2015!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://orig11.deviantart.net/a1fc/f/2017/016/f/d/primarina_beanie_by_areica-davoedc.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI created a Patreon page because I want to begin expanding my plush making. I want to move into Artist Alleys at conventions, but as a full-time college student at an intensive art school, using my free time on convention stock and prep instead of earning income on commissions is a huge financial risk. That\u0027s where Patreon comes in. With your help as a patron, I would be able to earn additional income while working on convention stock and have the opportunity to expand my plush making to the next level.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://img08.deviantart.net/1a48/i/2017/104/a/f/decidueye_pokedoll_by_areica-db5uilf.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatrons will get exclusive access to my concept sketches, and my plans for conventions and convention stock. I want to hear from you guys as contributors, so any posts I create are open to discussion with my patrons. I would also be willing to listen to recommendations on other content you might want to see here. :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
