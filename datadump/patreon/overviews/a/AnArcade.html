Due to the way Youtube and Twitch is set up at the moment small content creators like myself end up putting a lot of effort in for very little back. This Patreon was created for anyone who wishes to support this channel, my Twitch streams and my content overall. The support you guys give me will hopefully open up a possibility for me to do this as a full time thing allowing me to help my family and also pay the bills.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(192,80,77);\"\u003eWhy Should I Become a Patron?\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003eI could probably make some ridiculous promise here but I won\u0027t I\u0027d much prefer to talk to you honestly. There is only one reason you should become a Patron and that is if you think I deserve support and want to be a part of this Patreon community. I respect my Patrons so much for the support they have shown and I will never stop thanking each and everyone of you for your support no matter the size. The support you will have shown me with this donation is something of such a great magnitude that I could never repay and let\u0027s face it you\u0027re awesome.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for spending the time to read this and as always have a fantastic day :)\u003cbr\u003e"
