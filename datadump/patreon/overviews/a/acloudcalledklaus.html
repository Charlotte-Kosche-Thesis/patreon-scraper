I want to make soooo much more for you guys but of course its very difficult to balance life and creating especially with an amazing creation called bills. So quite simply, I need help to be able to dedicate more of my time to you guys. It also gives me a chance to create more personal bonds with you guys as if you see the lovely rewards I have put together you will really understand what I mean. So have a gander and do not feel obligated to pledge at all. I am happy that you came here and that you watch my channel in the first place guys. Peace and love!"
