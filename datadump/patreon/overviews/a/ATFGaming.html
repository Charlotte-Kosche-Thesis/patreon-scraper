I know alot of people cant afford to support money wise and thats fine. Im going to do my best to be fair to everyone. But my patrons will get extras. I also wanna say nothing I make here will go into my pocket. Everything will go towards the youtube channel and buying models, That you my patrons will get to choose from. I just wanna thank everyone of you for taking the time to read this and I hope you join me on the Journey!"
