Yarn Alchemist. Franco-Maori American Australian living in Japan.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Mission:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m a knitwear designer who curates words, images, and patterns to connect us more deeply to the story of why we create, for the knitter seeking to transmogrify knitting into experiences and moments that bless and uplift themselves and others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m on a mission to start a movement. I believe that our art and work as knitters can make a difference. More than ever, this craft, which forces us to slow down and breathe for just a moment, is needed in our society of instant gratification and go-go-go.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnitting is not just a hobby, but a form of art. It is a powerful medium of bringing more joy, healing, creativity, and connection into our lives\u2026 one stitch at a time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough intentional creation, we are capable of transformative impact.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eKnitting is magical and powerful. And I\u2019m here to show you how your passion for knitting can make a difference in your life and the lives of others.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTo understand what Patreon is first, a bit of a vocab lesson. Patreon is a play on the word \u201cpatron\u201d, as in patron of the arts. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\"\u003cstrong\u003epatron of the arts\u003c/strong\u003e (\u02c8pe\u026atr\u0259n \u0259v \u00f0\u026a \u0251\u02d0ts) noun. someone who acts as a patron to or supports charities, organizations, and individuals that work in or concern the arts.\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis was the founding idea behind the creation of Patreon. For centuries, even stretching back to the early days of the Greeks, lovers and supporters of art would pay their favorite creators to continue... creating! They didn\u2019t get much in return, except the recognition and appreciation of their support and the satisfaction of their contribution of keeping the arts alive. Usually such Patrons were wealthy and could pretty much afford to pay for the artist\u2019s lifestyle. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNowadays things have changed thanks to the internet. One main difference is that art, in both consuming and supporting it, is now much more accessible to many more people, thanks to platforms like Patreon. And us creators can give much more tangible rewards in return. So now not only do you get the satisfaction of directly supporting your favorite creators and makers, you get rewards for it too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Should You Sign-Up?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI offer multiple tier levels for pledges, each with their own rewards and bonuses. As mentioned before, I don\u2019t want to rely solely on \"Pay us because you\u0027ll feel good!\" to keep Aroha Knits up and running. Sure, it feels great and amazing to support your favorite makers but I also want to make sure you get your money\u2019s worth out of it (I like to overcommit here). It\u0027s super easy to edit or cancel a pledge month to month, so there\u0027s no risk becoming a Patreon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason we set up this Patreon is to cover our monthly expenses: making sure my virtual assistant Sarah and my copy/tech editor Nancy get paid, as well as the rest of the bills for the programs and software that keeps Aroha Knits running. At the moment, this totals to about $2.5k each month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHitting that goal in of itself will be a HUGE deal to me, as it will allow me to focus on creating new knitwear designs, continue running workshops and challenges, and working on expanding or bettering the Aroha Knits brand, without having to worry about making ends meet and paying bills. If you appreciate and find yourself inspired and motivated by the work and value we provide to the fibre community, then please sign-up!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDo you have to sign up? Of course not! There are other ways to support us, and we will continue to create as it is allowed for us. However, if you are already a huge fan of Aroha Knits designs and call yourself a Fibre Muse, becoming a Patreon the most efficient way to support us, AND you get specialized rewards for doing so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are so fortunate to have such a loyal and dedicated community of Fibre Muses. Without you, Aroha Knits would not be where it is today!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTransform your yarn,\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eFrenchie, Founder of Aroha Knits\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
