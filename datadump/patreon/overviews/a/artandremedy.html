    "summary": "Hello Patrons, \u003cbr\u003eArt \u0026amp; Remedy has been created to highlight the talented works of the Pioneer Valley and provide exposure for so many fantastic artisans; some renown, many unknown. We\u0027re barely a month and a half old now and have been able to feature art works from local artists like; Laureen Shea, Nina Compagnon, Landscape Photographer Catherine Lee and Leather Works Artisan Cyd Reiman, as well as my Fashion and Accessory Vida Collection and a growing list of creatives in our area who\u0027ve had limited online exposure or are interested in expanding their opportunities.  Here in the Pioneer Valley, there is a wonderful sense of variety, cohesion and self discovery that cries out for a format of expression. Please visit our page at \u003ca href=\"http://www.artandremedy.com\"\u003ewww.artandremedy.com\u003c/a\u003e to see our initiative. Bookmark and subscribe to our free newsletter to stay informed of our expanding list of artisans and their products and services.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m Julio Mendez and I would first like to thank my wife Jodi Mendez who has been the center of my life for as long as I can remember and a major inspiration for the creation and launch of our page. In February of 2016, my wife Jodi suffered the first of four strokes that would turn our world upside down. While working for a nonprofit organization at the time, both Jodi and I could never have prepared ourselves for what was yet ahead for our family. By June of 2016 we were met with an even greater combined challenge, as my wife was diagnosed with stage III Breast Cancer with Metastatic Disease.\u00a0 Our journey thus far, has been difficult, wrought with pain, sorrow and sadness. Yet we have kept our inner spirit of love and nurturing strong.\u00a0 We have faced our demons and strive to enjoy life to the fullest, for we are guaranteed nothing else. To our many friends, fans and followers that have inspired the creation and evolution of our page, thank you all. We\u0027ve begun our initiative and look forward to working \ntogether with the tremendous talents of local Artists, \nPhotographers, Designers, Writers and Natural growers of foods, remedies and \ncrafts from the Pioneer Valley and beyond. We\u0027re asking for additional support in advancing our site\u0027s operations and initiatives, of providing unique, custom, original works of art, photography, literature, products and services to all of our patrons.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you like what we\u0027re doing and would like to qualify for Patreon exclusives, please give as is comfortable to help us continue our work and thank you from the bottom of our hearts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m excited to be part of the journey and hope you will join me. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
