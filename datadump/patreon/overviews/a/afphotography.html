    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Ashley, some of you may know me as Zen from\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.suicidegirls.com/members/zen\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSuicideGirls\u003c/a\u003e or\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.instagram.com/zen_sgphoto\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eInstagram\u003c/a\u003e. I am all about finding depth in the world around me and evoking emotion with my photography. My love for photography came at a young age and has continued to be my favorite creative outlet. Dabbling in all styles of photography, Natural Light is my favorite light source and continues to keep me on my toes, exploring and experimenting every chance I get. The human body is my favorite subject and I use it in many different ways- from Urban Fashion photography or Artistic Nudes, I do my best to tell a story with the sets I create. I\u0027ve come to Patreon with the hopes to share my visions with the world around me. Photography is my career but also my passion and having this platform to share my work can allow me to keep creating and keep expressing myself through my camera lens while getting paid. This is a space to support each other and our arts, where we can connect. As an artist it isn\u2019t always \u201ceasy\u201d to create and give away free content. Your support will allow me to pay for new equipment such as lighting, backdrops, props, wardrobe and editing equipment. In today\u2019s society we know that \u201cnothing comes for free\u201d but in this space, for myself and so many other artists, we are given the space to be supported by those who WANT to support us, who WANT to see our creations and who WANT to interact with and be a part of our lives. I\u2019m here to share my art with you, but I\u2019m also here to make connections. Your support helps me support my dreams, feed my family and helps me to keep creating cool things. So thank you!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am planning on using this page to give you access to exclusive content that I create, (little back story, when I set up a shoot, typically I\u2019ll end up with about 60+ final images that I\u2019m proud of and would like to share, but on any other platform like Instagram or Twitter, it\u2019s not accessible to post 60 images, here on Patreon I can share my entire creation and you can support my time, efforts and artistic vision!)\u003cbr\u003eBlogs and behind the scenes/previews will be updated weekly!\u003cbr\u003eAt least ONE FULL SET will be shared at the end of each month!\u003cbr\u003eThis may include:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Personal Blogs/Selfies/Etc.\u003cbr\u003e-Unseen photo creations\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-Behind the scene videos/pictures\u003cbr\u003e-Artistic Nude Patreon only photos (NSFW)\u003cbr\u003e-Influence on future sets\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDISCLAIMER\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome Content is NSFW \u0026amp; 18+ only.
