    "summary": "Hi! I\u2019m Kimberly, \u201cadorkablephil\u201d on Tumblr and AO3, and I\u2019m a writer.\u00a0Writing is a huge part of my identity, and always has been\u2014from the amusingly ambitious novel outlines I was plotting in elementary school to the M.F.A. program where I studied Creative Writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately, that\u2019s where things went awry. The pressures of graduate school were not good for my mental health, and I ended up having to drop out due to severe generalized anxiety disorder and depression. But, even though I am no longer able to work or go to school, I never stopped writing!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI now direct my writing passion into Dan and Phil fanfiction, otherwise known as \u201cphanfic.\u201d I particularly like to write stories that address important social issues (such as mental illness, bigotry, and body image), because I believe that fanfic can be a force for social change, as well as enjoyable entertainment. I also love to experiment, pushing myself creatively to write stories that are different from anything you\u2019ve read before!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince my mental health challenges may sometimes affect my ability to write for periods of time, I don\u2019t want to charge patrons a monthly subscription amount. Instead, you will only pay each time I post a story or chapter longer than 1,000 words. But don\u0027t worry! Patreon allows you to set a monthly maximum, so you\u0027ll never be charged more than you\u0027re comfortable with. You\u2019ll still get to enjoy the stories, but you won\u2019t keep getting charged for them once you\u2019ve reached your monthly max, even if that maximum is only $1. I usually post a story or chapter about once a week, but it does vary. If for some reason I don\u2019t post anything in a month, then you don\u2019t pay anything that month!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for taking the time to visit my Patreon page! If you choose to become a patron, you\u2019ll be encouraging unique, meaningful, and enjoyable phanfiction content ... while also getting special perks. I want my patrons to feel like they have a real relationship with me, and so I\u2019ll give you peeks inside my writing process, advance access to stories in progress, opportunities to influence what I\u2019m writing, personal interaction through Q\u0026amp;A\u2019s, and much more. And I\u2019m always interested to hear about any other kinds of perks/rewards you might be interested in. The sky\u2019s the limit!"
