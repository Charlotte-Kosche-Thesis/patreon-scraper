    "summary": "After running into bad luck with the DMV, Andrew (lead writer and animator) was let go from his trucking job, but then he found the ancient files to a long-lost unfinished project, buried deep beneath a compulsive amount of subfolders within his computer. It was the first episode of FTL - Kestrel Adventures. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThere had once been a dream to animate a team of Federation officers as they faced death to reunite the galaxy and meet awesome rock-men and robot aliens along the way. As the first episode was finished and uploaded, the sudden support from the online FTL community has been like a breath of fresh air. - If an overwhelmed rockman could cry he\u0027d be crying.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEach episode still takes time though, a lot of time, and space Rome wasn\u0027t built in a space day, and space time is space money. Hopefully, with further support the show can continue strongly, recording sessions can be held more frequently, and opportunities can be opened for viewer involvement with the show. Heck, we\u0027d also love to start a podcast as our characters, and hopefully, with support, the relentless tides of a randomly generated reality can be kept behind us as we jump beacon to beacon to face the Rebel Flagship.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nEven without a single dime, the show will continue until it becomes too burdensome to do so.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr until the Rebels are defeated.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nOr until we\u0027re all murdered by giant alien spiders, in space.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAll episodes will still be free on Youtube, and supporters will only pay when we provide results. (A.k.a when an episode is released.)\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIf you\u0027d like to support, please join our Patreon. We\u0027ve got a long way to go until Sector 9, and who knows what may come after that?....\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n- Andrew\n\u003cbr\u003e"
