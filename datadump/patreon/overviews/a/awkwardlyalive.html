    "summary": "Hello, patreons!! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eTHANK YOU. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for joining this awkward community. My ultimate goal with what I do is to spread joy. I believe in the power of comedy to do good in the world, because laughter is powerful and all of the things that have ever made me think or feel inspired are the things that have made me laugh. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also believe that comedy makes us feel less alone. My stories are here to remind you all that we are idiots and that\u0027s a good thing. I make a fool of myself every day, but I am also happier than I\u0027ve ever been since accepting that fact, and I want you to be that happy too. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComedy cannot change the world alone, however, which is also why 10% of everything I earn goes straight to charity, and I never make that decision alone. By joining this community of awkward nerds and goofballs, you get to weigh in on where that 10% goes.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn fact, just for kicks, let\u0027s talk about where all of the money that I make here\u00a0goes. I\u0027ve made this handy pie chart:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/beam.venngage.com/share/a827cb98-fc08-4fb2-aa4b-324d3a3b93f7.png?2412\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCharity: \u003c/strong\u003ePretty self-explanatory. We give back.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePatreon Fees\u003c/strong\u003e: Patreon takes a cut of everything I earn, which is totally fair. They deserve it.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAdvertising: \u003c/strong\u003eI try and set aside 10% of everything I make to spend on advertising - this could be promoting posts on social media or actually buying ad space on other blogs to try and grow the community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWeb Hosting Fees: \u003c/strong\u003eObviously, as a percentage, this will change depending on how much I\u0027m making every month, but the graph will be updated as needed.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverhead: \u003c/strong\u003eThis is basically all those little fees that I forget to include every month, but stuff like yarn for the critters that I make for the Awkwardly Audacious folks, any computer repairs, etc. I try and save 10% every month for those unexpected and random costs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eProfit: \u003c/strong\u003eIt\u0027s what I keep so that I can pay my bills and buy things like food and whatnot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eStill here and curious about who I am and what I do? Cool, here\u0027s a tad more info:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://awkwardlyaliveandpleasantlypeculiar.com/\"\u003ehumor blogger/writer\u003c/a\u003e in my twenties, and I\u0027m just trying my best. I spend my days reading, writing, and selling books, playing games, and snuggling with dogs, which is great. I do work in an independent bookshop, which keeps me fed, but when I\u0027m not there I\u0027m at home, at my desk, making words happen. If I could support myself even just a little bit with the words I write, I could spend more time making those words happen and less time stressing about bills and whatnot.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eOnce again, thank you. Now let\u0027s all go be idiots together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit my blog to read the stories: \u003ca href=\"http://www.awkwardlyaliveandpleasantlypeculiar.com\"\u003ewww.awkwardlyaliveandpleasantlypeculiar.com\u003c/a\u003e"
