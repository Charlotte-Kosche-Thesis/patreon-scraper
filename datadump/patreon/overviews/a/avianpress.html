In between stints of driving a taxi,\nmanaging an African art gallery, and writing film reviews, I\u2019ve pushed on with\nmy writing, from novels to screenplays to plays, and most recently as an\nindependent publisher. Starting Avian Press has given me the freedom to release\nexactly what I want, when I want, and to whom I want.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe idea for recording audiobooks came about after I got some very nice reactions to my readings at such famed bookstores as \u003cstrong\u003eCity Lights Books\u003c/strong\u003e in San Francisco, \u003cstrong\u003eDutton\u0027s Books\u003c/strong\u003e in Los Angeles, \u003cstrong\u003eBook Passage\u003c/strong\u003e in Corte Madera, \u003cstrong\u003eMoe\u0027s Books\u003c/strong\u003e in Berkeley, and the \u003cstrong\u003eBeat Museum\u003c/strong\u003e in San Francisco. A number of people suggested that I do my own audio versions of the books so that I could give my own particular spin to all of the crazy characters in the text. I began to understand the advantages of an author narrating his own work.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u201cTerry Tarnoff\u2019s book, \u003c/em\u003eThe Bone Man of Benares, \u003cem\u003ecalls to the reader like a train-whistle moaning in the distance. Written with rhythm and blues, it\u2019s the picaresque tale of a \u201960s expatriate looking for adventure all over the globe. But underneath the exotica is something even more compelling, the voice of a bona fide soul singer, a latter-day pilgrim, seeking the spiritual meaning of the road.

With Avian Press venturing into creating audiobook versions\nof my books -- starting with \u003cem\u003eThe Bone Man of Benares\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e-- we need $1500 per month for\nequipment and the various costs of recording.

We\u2019re hoping that some of you might provide\nfeedback in our forum and tell us what you think of the work in progress. This\nwill give us the opportunity to go back and make changes -- based upon\nsuggestions made by you, the patrons of the site -- before releasing the final\nproduct to the general public. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to the sense of satisfaction of\nsupporting artistic expression, subscribers will receive other benefits as\nwell. For example, at the \u003cstrong\u003e$5 per month level\u003c/strong\u003e, you\u2019ll have access to periodic videos from that Hopelessly Pompous British Gentleman in the introduction, to help\nbrighten your day.

Tarnoff makes you feel at home as you ride by his side on his global tour, sharing one incredible adventure after another. The trials and tribulations of romance and self-discovery, all set in exotic locales, make this adventure tale alternately engrossing, touching and hilarious. From the very first page until the last, it is nearly impossible to put the book down, and even more enjoyable to reread the second time.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u2013 David Amram, author of \u003c/em\u003eOff Beat: Collaborating with Jack Kerouac\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYour monthly subscription will help defray the costs\nof producing the audiobooks as well as providing funds for publicity and the\nmyriad expenses of running an independent publishing house. Fully 90% of your\nsubscription goes to Avian Press, with a very reasonable 5% going to Patreon and 5% for transaction fees. Our\nultimate goal is to raise $5000 per month in order to keep Avian Press vibrant\nand growing. With luck, our intrepid Director of Publicity might finally get a\nsalary!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo thanks in advance for your interest. As you can\nsee from the video, we\u2019re anxious to get going on the first audiobook, with\nplans to do all four books within the next year or so. If for any reason you\ndecide to cancel your monthly support, it\u2019s as easy as clicking a button. You can try\nit for just one month for as low as $1 and see what you think. To join up just click on the \"Become a Patron\" button and fill in your information.
