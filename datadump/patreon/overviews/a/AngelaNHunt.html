(I like running marathons. Yes. I\u0027m crazy.) I severely injured myself, having my right quadricep fail utterly on me at Mile 8. I finished the marathon like an idiot -- there\u0027s a separate blog entry about that -- and as a result, stopped running.\u00a0One small problem. The running was literally what was keeping me sane. A few months after the marathon, I found myself...let\u0027s just say I found myself in a really really REALLY dark place, wanting to just...stop.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI wanted to be dead.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI was trapped in the wasteland and didn\u0027t know how to find my way out. I lost my voice. I lost my heart. I lost...me. So I hied my ass straight to the doctor(s) -- there\u0027s five of them -- where they promptly diagnosed quite correctly that I was in the middle of an enormous episode of clinical depression, with a lovely side of panic disorder, for fun and profit.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cem\u003e   \u003cimg src=\"https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5493/31039767075_fe9def4bc9.jpg\" style=\"width: 275px;\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd out in this desolation, the Apocalyptica found me.

A place that might not necessarily ever be an actual physical place, or thing, and offered no guarantee ever of full healing. Because even with all we know, there\u0027s no cure for depression and chronic panic. In fact, it\u0027s often fatal.

So not only does the Patreon here support the continuing madness of recovery, it also serves as budget to acquire gear, go out on location more often, pay for studio time (my garage studio is *tiny*), and help rent whatever gear that I\u0027d rather rent than own.
