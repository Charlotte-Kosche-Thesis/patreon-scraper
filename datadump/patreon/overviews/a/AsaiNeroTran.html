Welcome to my about me section.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe short of it is that I make YouTube videos about video games, including comedic video game reviews, serious video game reviews, Top 10s, let\u0027s plays, and collaborative projects. Alongside the gaming content that I create on YouTube,\u00a0I am also the main person behind a weekly podcast called the \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003ePixel Perfect Plexcast\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e that covers both video games \u003cem\u003eand\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0professional wrestling. The \u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003ePixel Perfect Plexcast\u003c/i\u003e\u00a0airs every single Friday on Soundcloud and iTunes, with very infrequent breaks in schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to myself, there are multiple people working in tandem with me on all of our original content. I am the main person on this channel, so I do all of the editing \u0026amp; mixing, a lot of the acting, almost all of the voiceovers, and most of the game play. The other people at work here include, but are not limited to, \u003cstrong\u003eMarlon\u003c/strong\u003e (who co-hosts the \u003cb style=\"\"\u003ePixel Perfect Plexcast \u003c/b\u003ewith me every single week), \u003cstrong\u003eMatt\u003c/strong\u003e (who does some camerawork, a fair amount of the acting, and also assists in the creative process), \u003cstrong\u003eMyke\u003c/strong\u003e (who assists with the writing and creative process, as well as occasionally acting, doing camerawork, and whatever tasks he is able to do), and \u003cstrong\u003eIzzy\u003c/strong\u003e (who is the co-editor of the script and the shows).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eHow we\u0027ll spend your cash money\u003c/h3\u003eAny and all donations will be used to help us maintain - and, more importantly, grow - as an entity. We\u0027ll be able to create higher quality productions, with better equipment, better software, more hands on board, and all the other benefits that come with...you know, a better budget than the almost nothing with which we\u0027ve currently been working. Haha.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf we get enough donations per piece of original content, we\u0027ll be able to bring on more people with a wider variety of skills, such as in-house musicians, designated editors, et al, which will free up DOZENS of hours for us to bring you better and better content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eObviously, don\u0027t feel OBLIGATED to donate. If you want to donate, don\u0027t feel like you have to give an EXORBITANT amount. Donate only if you want to, and at whatever amount you\u0027d like. We appreciate every dollar, and every dollar is hugely important in helping us accomplish our goals.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3\u003eFinal Thoughts\u003c/h3\u003eEven if we make NOTHING from this endeavor, our content will still be free for everybody to enjoy! For those who DO donate, just know that you are a vital part of this operation!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e$1 is more than we could hope for, and of course, more support means more regular content from all of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks, everyone!\u003cbr\u003e-Asai Nero Tran\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(0,0,0);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBusiness email:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003ca class=\"__cf_email__\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003e[email\u00a0protected]\u003c/a\u003e\n/*  */\u003c/h4\u003e"
