    "summary": "\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eWelcome and thank YOU, I have been searching for a way to give back to my listeners, supporters, and fellow creatives for a very long time. Thankfully, Patreon is giving me the opportunity to do what I already do everyday, which is create music, while at the same time develop a real support and backing from you guys, the listeners. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMusic has been a passion of mine for years and as a producer you sometimes live off of the work you sell to artists which can be a gamble. Some months are better than others, that\u0027s just the way things go.\u00a0As a husband and father of 2 young boys it can be a challenge at times. Any creative would probably tell you the same thing, it\u0027s hard to find people who value art and are willing to contribute to it. That\u0027s where you come in. Patreon creates a real way for you to support the art you love by pledging anywhere from $1 to $10 a month and up(don\u0027t worry, you can cancel at any time). The choice is yours and there\u0027s plenty in it for you as well. The higher your pledge, the higher your rewards will be!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the average listener, this will now be the only way to get exclusive content from me. Remixes, instrumentals, videos. For artists, this will be a great way to build and to gain early exclusive access to my production before other artists do. I\u0027ll also be doing song critiques, mentor-ship, skype sessions for any and all questions, for as long as you remain a patron.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs for producers, I got some great things in here for you guys! Over the past few years I\u0027ve had so many producers ask me to collaborate, create a drum/sound kits, show them my creative process or ask for mixing tips. I would help whenever I could but my most valuable asset is my time. Thankfully, Patreon opens up the opportunity for you to find out everything you want to know in a real way while still valuing what I bring to the table. I\u0027ll also be creating samples for collaboration(and possible placements), drum kits, screen shares, beat critiques, etc. \u003cbr\u003eTrust me, you will want to invest in this! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main goal here is to inspire, contribute to the culture and create real support to be able to continue to do what I love. So I thank you in advance, because without you this wouldn\u0027t be possible. Now let\u0027s grow together and make some heat!\u003cbr\u003e-A.G.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
