I\u0027m Ari Melenciano (Ariciano) and i\u0027m a multidisciplinary visual artist, designer, creative technologist, educator. and Masters candidate at New York University\u0027s Interactive Telecommunications Program. I spend my life aiming to\u00a0merge art, design and technology to alchemize the otherwise mundane into extraordinary, in every facet. I am\u00a0passionate about education, creativity, experiential design, altruism, social justice and Black culture.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhat is Ariciano TV?\u003cbr\u003e\nAriciano TV is an online video channel that creates video tutorials on ways of creating when merging art and technology. Here we learn how to code, use various machinery, get exposed to various softwares and applications, and plenty more. I also love to travel, read and document life, so you\u0027ll find videos dedicated to those passions, as well. I aim to release 2 online creative technology tutorials every week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy did I create Ariciano TV?\u003cbr\u003e\nForemost, the opportunity to share all the amazing skills i\u0027m learning and gaining with anyone else that might be interested, is beyond exciting to me. I find an incredible amount of happiness \u00a0in being able to turn ideas into quintessentially beautiful experiences for others to enjoy. I also recognize the value of self-expression and believe that it is important to constantly express one\u0027s self in as many ways as possible, and learning knew ways to do so is very empowering. But mostly, when searching for online video tutorials on engineering, technology and design, it is difficult to find people of color, let alone, women of color, being the ones teaching. I didn\u0027t get to grow up in a world where I was able to learn about technology from people that looked like me, and I recognize how that lack of representation can subliminally deter one;s ability to dream of theirselves in that position. So, I want to make sure the younger me\u0027s, the people my age and older than me that find resemblance and a cultural connection with me, can learn from someone like me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/093b5a7147480d6913d61971cc068022/tumblr_oj9orgToZ61qijjbho2_1280.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nWhy support Ariciano TV?\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen you support Ariciano TV, you\u0027re making it much more possible for me to continue creating these videos. When you support, you\u0027re saying that: \u003cbr\u003e\n-You find value in diversifying the tech world be it culturally, racially or with gender\u003cbr\u003e-You believe in the empowerment of all people\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e-You recognize the connection between the ability to dream and representation\u003cbr\u003e\n-You value self-expression and the opportunity of learning new ways to express one\u0027s self\u003cbr\u003e\n-You are gaining skills and new ways of thinking when it comes to merging art and technology by watching my videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for your support, I really appreciate it, we really appreciate it.\u003cbr\u003e"
