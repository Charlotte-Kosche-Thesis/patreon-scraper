I want to make some of these words into more tangible products, like traditional books, interactive game/puzzle books, mixed-media art projects, clothing designs, and performance pieces. As I start this, I don\u0027t have the funding to manufacture anything physical. Some weeks, I\u0027m kind of iffy about whether I have the funding to eat. And I have to keep taking breaks from writing to chase other paying work, which may or may not be anywhere near as enjoyable for either of us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith your help, I can change this, and start producing awesome things that you can buy, collect, watch, read, trade -- whatever you like.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon funding will go first and foremost towards my basic living expenses, because it\u0027s really difficult to produce thoughtful comedy and epic tales of adventure while you\u0027re starving. \u00a0After that, it will go towards maintaining a basic web presence for my writing, electronic art forms, and records of any performances, as well as a place to buy any projects that I opt to sell. After that, I start buying random art supplies and checking on things like printing costs, to see what truly awesome things I can do.\u003cbr\u003e"
