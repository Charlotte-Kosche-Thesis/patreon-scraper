And I want you to be as well.\u003cbr\u003e\nI share the progress of my builds through Youtube and Facebook and work hard at\nproducing as much content as I can.  I am entirely self-taught in this, so\nI strongly believe that anyone who sees awesome things can do it\nthemselves. As everything you\u2019ve seen\nhas been made by people, and you\u2019re a people.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I Producing?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI create tutorial videos on Youtube, where I walk viewers through the creation process\nof costume pieces. These tend to be\nCosplay pieces for recent media, but are sometimes paid commissions for\ncharacters and monsters. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ve been sculpting for six years as a hobbyist and have\ngotten serious about improving my skills over the last year. So, I usually sculpt about two new things a\nmonth, from Monster Faces to full head masks I bring you through my entire process.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is all streamed over Twitch Creative as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nUntil now, I\u2019ve been funding this with my disposable income through\nmy full-time job. But as of Academic\nYear 16/17, I\u2019ll be a full time student so the costs of producing this content\nwill start to get away from me.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI am hoping that people who enjoy my content, would like to\nsee where it goes, and also would REALLY want me to sculpt their favourite\ncharacter would like to support me through this.\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, I do sell my work through Etsy and accept commission work to support\nmyself and my work, but some people don\u2019t need any of that and may appreciate a\nway to be part of the channel without a major investment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat Isn\u2019t Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI enjoy helping people with their work!I have years of experience making costume for LARP, Theatre and Cosplay,\nand whilst I believe I have a lot of learn myself, I love sharing my knowledge.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhat I don\u2019t want my Patreon to become is the only way for\npeople to come to me for help, as that\u2019s the main reason I create content. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t see a \u201cAt this Reward\nyou\u2019ll get a skype call about you\u2019re costume!\u201dAs I will happily help in whatever way I can with anyone\u2019s costumes,\njust drop me a message over Facebook or in a comment here.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThat\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t have fun chatting nights with\nPatreons, but we\u2019ll see where we\u2019re going first.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeedback!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nOf course, I\u2019m new to this. My Youtube\nchannel is still small, there aren\u2019t many of you lot, and I can\u2019t say I know\nwhat I\u2019m doing.\u003cbr\u003e\nReally, I want to hear what content of mine you\u2019ve enjoyed the most, what you\nwant to see later?I want to know what\nyou\u2019d like from this Patreon or my Twitch Creative streams.\u003cbr\u003e\nWell, biggest thing is of course,\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you all for your support!\u003cbr\u003e"
