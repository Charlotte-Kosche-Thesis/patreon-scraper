    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Amanda White. Welcome and thank you for checking out my page. I appreciate you stopping by. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe quick run-down:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e1. I\u2019m\na writer and a traveler. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e2. Patreon\nis an online platform that lets people support the artists and/or creative\nprojects they enjoy.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e3. You\ncan become one of my Travel Companions as I blog about my travels, write a\nnovel, and create short stories over the next 10 and a half months. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e4. Read\non below for more in-depth info about me and what I\u2019m doing. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e5. Be\nsure to check out my video which was shot at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic\nPark in London. It\u0027s a little goofy, but there you go. \u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e6. Remember\nI appreciate you so much. Read on, you readers!\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWho am I?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy\nname is Amanda White.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst\nand foremost, I\u2019m a writer. This means I spend a lot of time having imaginary\nconversations in my head (mostly). As often as possible, I\u2019m also a traveler.\nSometimes these two things happen at the same time and I end up with content\nthat I\u2019ve heard at least one person say is \u003cem\u003every\ninteresting stuff\u003c/em\u003e. Though that was probably my mother. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBasic\nfacts and some possibly irrelevant qualifications: I\u2019m a fourth generation\nTexan without a Texas accent, I am the second of six children, I lived a decade\nin Colorado, have a black belt in Judo, have a degree in Literary Studies, would\npick going to outer space over deep sea diving, have visited and/or lived in 19\ncountries (so far), and once won a poker tournament (which sadly had no cash\nprize). \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwrite because I believe that stories are important. Stories link us to the past\nand give us a way to explore the future before we get there. Stories provide us\nwith an infinite array of tools to address the present whether through\nemotional connection, escapism, real life examples, vicarious experience, the\ngaining of knowledge, or just out and out lose-yourself-in-the-pages pleasure. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwrite to express my own unique way of seeing and to understand my place in the\nworld. I write because no one else can tell the stories I tell in exactly the\nsame way. I write because stories are meant to be shared and because I relay\nstories best through the written word.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I write?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nwrite a travel blog that\u2019s maybe better classed as a travel memoir. I don\u2019t often\ntalk about how much things cost, which streets you should take to get to Trafalgar\nSquare, or what to wear. But if I did, you\u2019d see how I manage to travel on a\npretty scrawny budget, how quick I am to ask for directions, and that I really\nhave no sense of style at all. What I do convey is a sense of the places I\u2019ve\nbeen, the people I\u2019ve met, and the things I do, and, hopefully in such a way\nthat you feel you\u2019ve come along for the ride. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAdditionally,\nI write short stories. Sometimes these are literary, sometimes magical realism,\nsometimes something that I don\u2019t exactly know how to categorize. Someone once\nsaid that my short stories show my dark side. Yes, that was also my mother. But,\nI protest, they aren\u2019t all dark. Some of these stories have been published with\n\u003cem\u003eFlash Fiction Magazine\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eEvery Day Fiction\u003c/em\u003e, and the online\nJournal \u003cem\u003eR\u00e9arrange\u003c/em\u003e. The next issue of \u003cem\u003eThe Gateway Review\u003c/em\u003e will feature my story \u003cem\u003eDaddy Guy and Child God. \u003c/em\u003eIf you\u2019d like to read any of these stories\ngive me a shout out and I\u2019ll be happy to link you and the stories up. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\nalso write novels in the literary fiction genre. I\u2019ve completed four (though, if\nI\u2019m going to be a stickler for details, one should really be classed as an\naction adventure story). At the moment, with the belief that the more I work,\nthe better I get, I\u2019m also working on a new novel which is about music,\nsiblings, and has some strange links to the Carpenters, Charles Lindbergh, and\nAmelia Earhart. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat does this mean?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nBasically,\nit means that the hours I spend agonizing over words are all done on my own\ntime and more or less, excepting the occasional paid story, without\ncompensation. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I live? \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nYou\nmean, where do I get my money? That\u2019s a good question. I do a lot of odd jobs\nto enable my writing (from ranch hand to dog sitter to art class model to ESL\nteacher to winter wilderness caretaker). I pinch pennies. I live frugally. I\ndon\u2019t count my chickens before they\u2019re hatched (I also worked a weekend on a\nchicken farm so I know how silly that would be). I stay often with friends who,\nas domicile-providing patrons of the arts, let me live in their spare rooms for\nextended periods of time. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy do I need patrons if I work to support\nmy habit?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nFirst\noff, Michelangelo had at least one patron and look at the kind of stuff he turned\nout! Secondly, my work is often seasonal, short term, and low-paying which means\nI end up eating \u003cbr\u003e\n\nUncle\nBen\u2019s Rice \u0026amp; Grains (which can be purchased for one British Pound per\npackage) for dinner nearly every night. I\u2019m funding my current phase of existence\nthrough a combination of hard work, some timely life circumstances, and a lot\nof planning. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf\nyou are up for the adventure, you could become one of my Travel Companions by\nclicking the Become A Patron button. By joining me in the journey, you\u2019ll keep me\nfrom eating only the aforementioned food, you\u2019ll get to come along with me as I\ntravel to really cool places, you\u2019ll have access to some behind the scenes details\nof what it\u2019s like being a solo traveler and writer, and you\u2019ll be instrumental\nin removing the Damocles\u2019 Sword (also known as the imminent peril of a Constant\nand Really Strict Budget) that\u2019s hanging over my head. I did mention that I\nhave a degree in Literary Studies and that I operate with a really tight belt,\nright?\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat am I up to?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019m\non an 11 month journey \u2013 which started mid-January and will end mid-December. During\nthis time, I\u2019ll be part tourist, part expat-of-sorts, and all-time writer. My\ntravels have already taken me on a four day adventure in Iceland, and will\ncontinue with me touring through England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the\nRepublic of Ireland, Norway, and Sweden. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll\nsee things like the Avebury Stones, Glastonbury Tor, Conwy Castle, Sherwood\nForest, and possibly a fjord or two. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll\nfollow after writers, artists, and locals.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll\ntake the path less traveled. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nI\u2019ll\nwalk along the roads that Richard the Lionheart, Robin Hood, and King Arthur\nand his Knights of the Round Table walked. \u003cbr\u003eI\u2019ll do all that plus lots of other\nreally cool stuff as it comes up.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAs I\nmentioned, during this time I\u2019m writing a new novel. I\u2019m posting a weekly blog\nevery Monday. And I\u2019ll be writing short stories as they come to me. Additionally,\nI\u2019ll be meeting new people, visiting places I\u2019ve never been before, having lots\nof conversations about American politics, taking pictures, and apparently eating\nquite a lot of Uncle Ben\u2019s Rice \u0026amp; Grains.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u2019s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOkay.\nEvery week on Monday I\u2019ll post a blog. Which means you get to travel alongside\nme through 8 countries, numerous towns and cities, along riversides, and over\nhills. You don\u2019t even have to be a patron for that just a reader. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nBy\nthe way, while I\u2019m on the subject, thank you very much for reading! You reading\nmy stories is the greatest thing that ever happens. Thank you.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut wait, there\u2019s more\u2026 \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf,\nwithout obligation, you feel a sense of joy in becoming a patron be sure to\ncheck out the reward levels listed either to the right or down below (depending\non the device you\u2019re reading from). Come join me for the journey. I\u2019d love to\nhave you alongside me! Become one of my Travel Companions and you\u2019ll get the\nlisted things plus the chance to see some videos, have conversations about\nwhere I am and what I\u2019m up to, and even suggest some travel adventures for me\nto take. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for being here! I hope you stick around!\u003cbr\u003e"
