    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eThis year I have decided to take my career as a health-advocate and an artist to a new level. I am now entering my second semester at Appalachian State University in the Gerontology graduate certification program. Gerontology is a rigorous social science that examines; the entire life course of people and the social, cultural, psychological, physical, economic and governmental policies that can impact quality of life of older adults and of the wider society. My focus within gerontology is to develop and promote non-pharmacological music and arts-based interventions and health promotion programs using the arts and community engagement to enhance the quality of life of our elders, family caregivers and of the entire community of multi-generational groups. \u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eBy 2030, the world is expected to experience a massive growth in the number of older adults above the age of 65. Just for fast stats, by 2030 the number of older adults above the age of 65 will reach close to 80 billion, and even more notable, by 2030 the number of oldest old 85 years and older, will increase by 95%. Furthermore, cases of cognitive decline and other chronic disease conditions are projected to rise drastically. This increase in older adult population will require a lot of creativity and modifications within our approach to community programs, chronic disease management, healthcare, education, housing, and caregiving. Research shows that music, arts, fitness, education and community engagement are valuable tools for improving quality of life, reducing caregiver stress and for the prevention of numerous age-related issues. I am confident that in the face of a rapidly changing society, music and arts will become increasingly recognized as an irreplaceable tool for the maintenance of public health in our communities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for joining me in this effort to create more sustainable arts and health programming for generations to come.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout Ash Devine the musician :\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAward-winning songwriter, folk-Americana-country musician, and multi-talented humanitarian performance artist is based the Blue Ridge Mountains of Asheville, North Carolina. Ash\u2019s unique and classic folk sound and interactive stage presence has been compared to the legendary Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. Recently seen on stage with Grammy-winning folk artists David Holt and Sheila Kay Adams, Ash Devine\u2019s folk Fusion style gleans sounds of Appalachian traditional folk, Americana-pop, and classic rock. Ash Devine is an accomplished instrumentalist on finger-style and Flat Pick style Guitar and innovative original Ukulele picking style. Her breathy and rich vocals and fingerpicking guitar styles sound like a marriage of Maybelle Carter and Pete Seeger with Kate Bush as the producer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e1st place Brown Bag Songwriter Comp:2010 \u003cbr\u003e1st Place Music Selection Twin Rivers Media Festival 2009 \u003cbr\u003e1st Place Best Composition: Downtown Music Lab 2004 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u201cAsh Devine\u2019s vocals whisper like an old-timey back woods wind. \u201d -Beth Simpson\u003cbr\u003eAsh\u2019s stage presence is dynamic, charismatic and steeped in audience connection and participation.
