We are actively pursuing ours and could use a little help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of working hard at various jobs, adventures and travels, living and learning, we have come up with the ultimate project for a long term amazing adventure. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eImagine building a 38 foot wooden sailboat from scratch, with your own two hands. Cutting down trees, milling them into lumber, melting 9,000 lbs of lead for ballast, then actually building the boat!  \u003cbr\u003eOnce the boat is built you can then go anywhere in the world. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eANYWHERE YOU WANT!! \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThat\u0027s exactly what we are doing and\u00a0we don\u0027t want to do it alone, we want you to come with us!\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/568859161115e06a4a224917/569d4b5ecbced647da3f4361/58c588925016e1ebfdea9630/1489340566565/ACORNARABELLA-Illustration-NOBACK.png?format=750w\" style=\"width: 195px; float: left; margin: 0px 10px 10px 0px;\"\u003eWe want you to feel the rush of a 70\u0027 pine slamming into the ground, the straining muscles as a 1,500+ pound log is rolled onto the sawmill by hand, the trepidation of 4.5 tons of molten lead over a roaring fire and the joy of antique hand tools singing their way though the timbers to finally reveal a beautiful curvaceous sailboat named Arabella. \u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eThen the real adventure can begin, taking Arabella to the 4 corners of the world.  The fjords of Norway, Caribbean, Japan, the coast of Alaska, Greece, Italy, Spain, the Baltic\u0027s... The possibilities are endless.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait!  Before you tell us you can\u0027t join us due to your job or family or just the circumstances of life in general.  What if we brought this adventure to you?  What if we documented the whole experience and allowed you to jump in and out of it at your own will.  A moment of escape from the daily grind as you come along with us on this incredible journey?  Videos will be uploaded at regular intervals and you can follow along with us as you wish.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are documenting the whole journey.  From the sweat and tears going into the build, all the way to the unknown which comes with finally setting sail.

The videos have been a huge time suck and honestly... more work than we anticipated.\u00a0 However we want to be able to share this journey!\u00a0 So...\u003cbr\u003eAlix quit his job at the coffee shop and is now working full time on making videos and helping with the build.\u00a0 This means that Steve is now working full time again.\u00a0 Lucky for us, a friend up the road runs his own tree crew/plowing business and Steve has become one of his main guys.\u00a0 This gives us a little flexibility and the possibility of using certain equipment BUT that means less time working on the boat.\u00a0 So, let\u0027s free up some of Steve\u0027s time!\u003cbr\u003eIf we can make this goal and sustain it, we can have Steve drop down to part time in the Spring.\u00a0 Our next goal will be to quit entirely!\u003cbr\u003e",
