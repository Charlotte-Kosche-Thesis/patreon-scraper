I began my published freelance work with small gaming publications in \n2004, but since 2010 I\u0027ve mostly been working per-contract projects (such as sketch cards and conceptual design) as well as \nprivate commissions. My great, burning passion is sequential art (comic books!) and while I had a regular superhero webcomic back in the early 2000s, since then I haven\u0027t had the time to devote to telling my own stories. At the forefront is a graphic novel compilation of several short horror stories. With funding and support, my goal is to make headway on the horror comic anthology, with finished pages by the end of 2015!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve always been a huge supernatural horror aficionado and, since moving back to New England in 2011, I\u0027ve been inspired to work on my own ghosty-type stories. Many of my ideas have been hashed out while I\u0027m out running on the back-roads of New Hampshire. Maybe this comes off as corny, but rural New England is beautiful and inspiring. (Hey, it\u0027s been working well for Stephen King.) There\u0027s just something I love about big expressive rocks in the middle of nowhere, red leaves carpeting October forests, ancient crumbling stone walls in the woods, and surprise mini-cemeteries where you least expect them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will help me set aside greater chunks of time to flesh out these stories and make my original anthology possible! I update my activity feed at least once per week with Patron-only content including concept and character sketches, thumbnails, work-in-progress snapshots, and other sneak peeks that will not be made available anywhere else. Thank you so much for your interest and support!\u003cbr\u003e"
