    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eGreetings and salutations Nerds and Nerdettes!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eHello one and all, my name is AlphaOmegaSin....(I suddenly feel like I\u0027m cutting a Paul Heyman promo)....anyhow, For those who don\u0027t know me I\u0027m a YouTuber who talks about all things gaming \u0026amp; sometimes delve into anime, comics, wrestling, and metal. Basically a bunch of my loves and interests that make the world that much more awesome in my eyes and spreading it further out there into the internet ether. I\u0027ve been doing this for around 9 years now online, discussing the good \u0026amp; bad of the entertainment world and its vast wonders with a ample array of vulgarity peppered in for good measure.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/SSJBXbC.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy the hell should anyone support this Patreon page Alpha?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eI\u0027m essentially treating this like a glorified tip jar of sorts but would be using whatever funds from this to pay for a full-time editor (On top of the things I edit together myself) to help crank out higher quality videos, reviews of games, livestreams a couple times a week, travel expenses for flights to meet up with fellow YouTubers \u0026amp; do some much overdue collaborative videos, upgraded equipment for recording and editing, etc. Plus I figured I could also do some Patreon exclusive vlogs on here that\u0027d be kinda fun to do since they wouldn\u0027t really fit on my channel as it is currently. It\u0027s all optional and again nothing really changes except the prospect of potentially being able to make more content and make it better which is something I\u0027ve been wanting for a few years now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/FeyLqHw.png\" style=\"width: 537px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eBut \u00a0Alpha doesn\u0027t this make you a sellout? All YouTubers are super rich I hear\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eIf your frontal lobe was replaced with a half rotten kiwi found in a Walmart parking lot then perhaps that may make sense. Being a sellout means compromising ones beliefs or forgetting who they are in exchange for cash or favors....explaining this to a moron is like talking to a sun dried dog turd in an empty park. Like I said nothing would change this is just an optional thing that\u0027d help make things better over time. I\u0027ve wanted to do so much more with my channel that I never got to pursue and this would be a means to that end \u0026amp; even if this doesn\u0027t do well I\u0027m still gonna do my best with what I\u0027ve got and try harder regardless.\u003cbr\u003e\nAs for YouTubers being super rich, even before all the adpocalpyse BS on YouTube lately tons of people weren\u0027t making much of anything on YouTube in truth with the exception of a fortunate select few. Then couple that with millions using adblock \u0026amp; the tons of automated flags from YouTube and there ya go. Let alone on a channel like mine that honestly isn\u0027t the kind of thing YouTube would wanna make front page, I\u0027m not exactly marketable or family friendly as you can see and won\u0027t change that and haven\u0027t changed that throughout the 9 years I\u0027ve been creating videos. Hell even if you can\u0027t support on here the fact you watch is a big deal to me and genuinely means a lot. I know saying that isn\u0027t exactly helpful in this overall cause but it\u0027s truthfully how I feel and wanted to just say thank you, without any of you it\u0027d just be one nerdy metalhead talking to a camera for thousands of hours all these years.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/J2cZox9.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eThank you....and you, and you and you and you too, also you over there\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eThe fact that any of you wants to help in any regard means the world to me and still to this day just blows my mind that anyone actually gives a damn. There\u0027s so many things out there that don\u0027t get covered or given the proper platform they deserve, I just wanna be able to help with that. I want tio add a voice to an entire side of something in the industry that isn\u0027t being heard, bring to light albums, shows, games, comics etc. that don\u0027t get noticed, and just overall have fun since that\u0027s what this sorta thing is all about. You\u0027re all helping with that, so I thank you"
