This was a really interesting afternoon spent with Anthony Haynes. He was a great tutor, presenting the topic in a clear, easy and fun way which was easy to understand (which was a very tough job considering the topic!) It was really interesting to hear definitions of emptiness from other places other than the Tibetan Buddhist side which I was already familiar with. I found this to be a very beneficial course and would highly recommend both the course and Anthony as a teacher and I look forward to attending the Academy for further teachings.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Mark Laidlaw, on The Way of Emptiness (10th June 2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Anthony Haynes is the best private tutor and proofreader I have ever had. He is an expert at proofreading with lots of experience. He has lots of knowledge not only about Western philosophy but also Eastern philosophy. His knowledge about Taoism has been helpful as he has provided constructive criticism and suggested revisions of my work. Anthony is also a kind and caring person who can get along with everybody. I strongly recommend him as a tutor and proofreader.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Jaeho Jang, PhD in Science \u0026amp; Religion, University of Edinburgh (January 2015 - Present)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Anthony Haynes (Haoyu Yang) was my tutor for the God in Philosophy course. He was one of the best seminar leaders I had in my first year, managing to engage everyone in the discussion and make the course content seem interesting and easy to learn. I enjoyed every seminar in this course due to this, as well as due to the relaxed and casual atmosphere he created.\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u0027I would definitely encourage anyone to considering tutoring from him as he makes learning about even the most complex things fun and understandable.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Lydia Bell, MA in Philosophy, University of Edinburgh (\u0027God in Philosophy\u0027 module, January 2017 - April 2017)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Last year Anthony tutored me in my Ethics and Society module. In most tutorials at university, there is mostly one constant speaker, this is either because it is their presentation week, or they are confident in speaking and debating about the topics. However, Anthony organised the classes in a way that everyone would try make contribution to the debate that we were studying in that week. This I found especially important, as it helped increase my confidence in contributing in class. When it came to writing the essay for this course Anthony was more than happy to look at my essay plan and answer any questions about the essay that I was unsure about. As a student with dyslexia, this was vital for me. I would therefore encourage anyone who wants to be tutored in philosophy or theology to definitely consider being tutored by Anthony.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Katy Welford, MA in Philosophy \u0026amp; Theology, University of Edinburgh (\u0027Ethics \u0026amp; Society\u0027 module, January 2016 - April 2016)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Anthony is incredibly knowledgable in a wide variety of philosophical positions and theories. Having had him as a tutor during a course called Atheism in Debate, he was able to easily switch between giving concise information on a topic and facilitating a conversation or debate in it. Throughout the entirety of the course there was never an aspect that he was unfamiliar with nor a question he was unable to answer. The seminars were always very engaging and he introduced new ways of learning about the topics beyond the lecturing and discussion normally associated with seminars. I couldn\u0027t recommend a more adept and better equipped tutor to be taught philosophy from.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Isaac Henderson, MA in Religious Studies, University of Edinburgh (\u0027Atheism in Debate\u0027 module, October 2015 - December 2015)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Anthony was the tutor of my seminar group during the \u0027Atheism in debate\u0027 programme at Edinburgh University. Offering a lot of room for everyone to speak, he really helped that group of first year students open up and voice their opinions, which led to some very interesting discussions. In my opinion Anthony is a tutor who will help you find the answer yourself instead of dictating it to you. Outside of the tutorials I greatly appreciated his help when it came to essay writing. I was happy to consult his experience and knowledge to help me make sense of my essay question. In conclusion: Anthony is a great guy, with plenty experience in philosophy and I would highly recommend him as a tutor.\u0027\u003cbr\u003e\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t- Steyn van Leeuwen, BA in Mathematics, Physics \u0026amp; Astronomy, University of Utrecht\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027As a student in the MSc Science \u0026amp; Religion programme at New College (Edinburgh University), Anthony\u2019s help was invaluable. Not only did he provide excellent academic guidance in the 7 months of his tutelage, he also encouraged and supported me personally through the intensive process.
