Each Reward Tier, of\ncourse, has its own bonus, but the page is structured with low cost tiers and as I\nestablish and reach each Goal, the Goals become available to every Patron. \n\u003cbr\u003e\nI want everyone to be able to enjoy and afford the\ninformation here. One of the things that bring me the most joy is when my work can\ninspire someone. If my work inspires *you* to work, to write, to draw, to\ninspire and to keep working - to delve into your own art, your own world, then\nI am happy. When someone says, \"I saw you do this... how do you do that?\nWhat does it mean? What story are you telling?\" that makes me happy. I\nlove to talk about my process and my ideas.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"http://i.imgur.com/M5z9C86.jpg\" style=\"width: 551px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAllen Williams Studio (Who am I?)\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have been a working artist and illustrator for over 28 years.

All during this time I would also work on my own ideas, concepts and\nartwork. My art has been exhibited in galleries around the US and overseas.
