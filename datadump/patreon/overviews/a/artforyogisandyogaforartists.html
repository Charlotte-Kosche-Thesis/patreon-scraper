    "summary": "Hello lovely people, \u003cbr\u003eThank\u00a0you for visiting Patreon and thank you so much for your support of Art for Yogis and Yoga for Artists. In creating the online component of Art for Yogis\u2014 the website and podcast\u2014 my intention is to spark discourse about the intersection of art and spirituality and to provide a resource for people who have aspirations in these areas. \u00a0In working as both an artist and yoga instructor and connecting with so many people, it continually amazes me how many creative professionals have spiritual leanings and how many dedicated spiritual practitioners have creative backgrounds. Interestingly in my own life the teachers who have most impacted me blurred these lines so heavily that it became difficult to make any such distinction. It has also been truly heartening for me personally to speak with so many inspiring people and to realize that they too struggle with some of the same issues that I struggle with around integrating these pursuits. Being equally devoted to art making and spiritual growth can make you feel a bit like Jekyl and Hyde. Time and time again creative spirituals have related to me in one way or another how although their art making seems to be spiritually motivated and their meditation practice or asana practice for example, helps to increase creative flow, they also experience at times profound discomfort in integrating these personas and often the nagging concern that one pursuit keeps them from going more fully into the other. So my hope is that by increasing dialogue around this unique set of concerns we can all learn and grow. And of course this conversation can also benefit and be interesting to people who are not exclusively working in these fields. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFeel free to reach out if you have suggestions for guests on the podcast or if you would like to submit content for the blog.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you again for your support!\u003cbr\u003eWith love,\u003cbr\u003eJeremy Hoffeld\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
