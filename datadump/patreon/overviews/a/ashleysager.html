I want to do it again, but I want to do it differently. I want to do it with you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe one problem is time.

Your help. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHaving you here will allow me to spend more time writing and will make it so I\u0027m able to create more spoken word videos and share more writing with you. After receiving feedback on my first book, Don\u0027t Forget About You, I realized more than ever how important words are to me and to other people. I was overwhelmed with support and comments and questions about the process. People wanted to know where the poetry came from, what it was like to publish a book, and so much more.\u00a0So that\u0027s why I\u0027m here.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon allows you to support the work I\u0027m creating and stand by my side while you do it. You\u0027ll have the option to give me any amount of money you want per month, and I will be forever grateful.
