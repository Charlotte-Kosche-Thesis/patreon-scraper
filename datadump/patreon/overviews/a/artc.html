    "summary": "The world is filled with sound and vision. We\u0027re mainly interested in the sound part. Oral storytelling has been part of the human tradition for thousands of years. ARTC brings that tradition into the present day with original stories, original adaptations, and sometimes just regular old weirdness told in the style of the classic audio dramas.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMulti-cast, fully soundscaped, with compelling stories and stirring musical scores, performed live and in the studio. Samples available at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.artc.org/topic/podcast\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003epodcast.artc.org\u003c/a\u003e.

The studio is a wonderful place where magic can happen, but it can also be confining and lack immediacy. By performing live, ARTC seeks to push the envelope of what is possible OUTSIDE of the studio!"
