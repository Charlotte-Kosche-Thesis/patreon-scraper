    "summary": "Hi there. Thanks for taking the time to come here and check out my Patreon! If you are here then you are probably a reader of my writing or someone who likes my edits, if you are, I just want to say that if that is all you do, then I am so grateful of you, knowing that people do actually read what I write and like what I make is amazing to see. This page is here if any of you feel like you\u0027d like to contribute towards my writing a little more than just reading it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am going to be changing how I write a little bit more from when I first made this Patreon. Instead of 3 pieces per month, I am going to aim to put out 1 chapters or one-shot a week. This will work in a pattern of 1 piece that goes up everywhere at the same time the first week then the second week will be one that is exclusive to Patrons for a few days, then it will go up to everyone else.\u00a0This will allow me to keep a structure to what I produce and give a reward do those that decide to support me. As this is what I am going to be aiming for, I will be making the page as a monthly payment rather than a per work payment. If I, for some reason, fall short one week I will announce before hand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIcons will continue to come out whenever new cards come out in SIF and Bandori. Patrons will get the chance to get an exclusive request each month for an icon and, depending on the tier, they might get other edits as well. Anything that is requested this way will be sent to you directly and it is your choice if you want to post it somewhere. Please do credit me if you do this.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe main reason I am creating this is it will allow me more motivation to actually write more as I am finding it more difficult to actually sit down and come up with something. I also want to use this as a way to interact more with the people that enjoy what I make. I will be creating a Discord server at the same time as this where there will be a channel and voice chat that are exclusively for patrons to talk to each other, and myself. As well as a channel for patrons to request things for me to write.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you want to join the server, whether you are a patron or not, click the following link:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://discord.gg/TFaCzCa\"\u003ehttps://discord.gg/TFaCzCa\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eOnce again, thank you for checking out my page. I hope that I see you around and you keep continuing to enjoy what I write and make."
