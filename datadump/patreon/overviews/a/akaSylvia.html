    "summary": "On the first of June, I\u0027m going to Skokholm.\u00a0 It\u0027s a tiny little island 2.5 miles off the coast of Wales but it may as well be 200.\u00a0 I\u0027m sleeping in a renovated cow shed. There\u0027s a shared toilet, no shower. Communal kitchen in the farm house. Well water. Solar power only. Limited phone coverage, no wifi. Seals. Puffins. Gale-force winds.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, I\u0027m packed and almost ready.\u00a0 It\u0027s already clear that my suitcase is too heavy and I have too many things and I\u0027m not sure what to do. \n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThings I could leave behind:\n\u003cbr\u003eRitz crackers \n\u003cbr\u003eSecond pair of boots\n\u003cbr\u003eExtra torch\n\u003cbr\u003e17 layers of clothes\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI keep looking at the food dubiously and then I look at my list again and it is literally, three meals a day plus a couple of snacks. The Ritz crackers with cheese count as a lunch and they really aren\u0027t heavy, so I don\u0027t think I\u0027m being stupid.\n \nNevertheless, they say to pack light because you have to get it on and off the boat etc and my suitcase weights 15 kilos and my shoulder bag has 5 litres of wine in it (NECESSITY) and then I have the camera bag and tripod and oh my god, what am I doing.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nNot to mention the fact that the wind and weather are against me. The Skomer boats were cancelled today, which means the Skokholm boat, if there was one, would have been cancelled too. The wind is dropping but the weather itself doesn\u0027t look like it is going to improve. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if I get on the island and the weather turns, I would be trapped there for another week. But I just can NOT pack two weeks worth of meals (I do have a 500g bag of dried beans so I won\u0027t starve) and still get my own suitcase on and off the rocking boat.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI make it sound like I\u0027m all camping and stuff, and I do have to bring my own sheets and towels and pillow cases and duvet covers, but I will have a bed and a roof over me. One of the weight issues is almost certainly the fact that I have seven camera batteries, two phone battery packs, plus a (240 gram) brick which can charge the iPad twice and a solar power charging device, not that it looks like there will be any sun but if there is I\u0027M HARVESTING IT! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOK, I\u0027ve got it down to one suitcase, one shoulder bag, one backpack. That\u0027s not crazy, is it? \n\nThe stupid boat probably won\u0027t even take me there and here I am worrying about the weight of my dried ramen. \n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIs it time to go yet?\u003cbr\u003e"

She emigrated to Scotland where she guided German tourists around the Trossachs and searched for the supernatural. She now splits her time between South Wales and Andalucia where she writes about plane crashes and faeries, which have more in common than most people might imagine. Her fiction was nominated for a Nebula in 2014 and her short stories have been translated into over a dozen languages. Her novella\u003cem\u003e Domnall and the Borrowed Child\u003c/em\u003e is forthcoming from Tor.com.
