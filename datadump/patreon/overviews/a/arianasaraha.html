     "about": "Ariana Saraha is a singer, musician, and composer from the western US with a global soul. Most often compared to Celtic singer Loreena McKennitt and alt-world artists \u003cem\u003eDead Can Dance\u003c/em\u003e, Saraha draws upon influences from the Mediterranean, Middle East, India, and Celtic \u0026amp; Eastern Europe, as well as performing a choice selection of traditional music of the same diaspora. But what really invites the listener in, beyond her vocal finesse and Old World influences, is Saraha\u2019s rare mixture of raw wildness and heartfelt intimacy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA Little Backstory\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt may come as a surprise that Saraha didn\u2019t even become a singer until she was nearly finished with college (where she was studying Psychology). But one day a voice and a song suddenly flew out unannounced, and in that instance she knew this was her path in life. Though unexpected, she credits the release of her voice with her explorations in dreamwork, depth psychology, trance dance, and Authentic Movement. \u003cem\u003e\u201cI was so meek from being outcast by my peers growing up, I didn\u2019t even know who I was at all. I was studying psychology because I was looking for meaning and purpose in this confusing, crazy world. And it was these practices that released the flow of energy that had been so long blocked by years of repression and fear. This energy apparently decided to come out as song!\u201d\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProfessional Experience:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn her first three years of songwriting, the floodgates opened and Saraha wrote over 100 songs. And then life took another unexpected turn: in 1999 she was offered the opportunity to sing lead vocals for the Colorado-based Mediterranean \u0026amp; Middle Eastern band \u003ca href=\"http://sherefe.org/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eSheref\u00e9\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e. For three years she learned and performed the traditional music of the Mediterranean, Balkan and Arab worlds, singing in Turkish, Arabic, Greek, Ladino, Bulgarian, Hebrew and Armenian languages. In 2004 she went in another direction and joined the electronica ensemble \u003cem\u003eTribal Electra\u003c/em\u003e for another three years, singing ancient mantras and prayers in Sanskrit, Hindi, Arabic, English and Hebrew over a bed of electronic beats and electric guitar. In 2007, enriched by these diverse musical experiences she finally launched her solo career by performing her original music at festivals and venues throughout the States. In August 2010, Saraha recorded \u003ca href=\"http://arianasaraha.com/albums/live-at-immersive/\"\u003ea live album\u003c/a\u003e in Boulder, Colorado (which was released the subsequent spring). She released her first studio album in 2015, \u003ca href=\"http://arianasaraha.com/albums/maiden-of-midnight/\"\u003e\u003cem\u003eMaiden of Midnight\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, which was co-produced with acclaimed dream-pop songstress \u003ca href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tinamaliamusic\"\u003eTina Malia\u003c/a\u003e and Mideast-music guru \u003ca href=\"http://www.jessemanno.com/\"\u003eJesse Manno\u003c/a\u003e.
