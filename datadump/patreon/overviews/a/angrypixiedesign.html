    "summary": "Who I am:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHi there. My name\u0027s Marie and I have been making costumes and props for almost 10 years. I genuinely enjoy sharing tips and tricks with people in the community so I often make video tutorials on my\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/javakat343\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eYouTube channel\u003c/a\u003e. Sharing my builds and discoveries, and often, my failures, can be the most rewarding part of my art. I developed a passion for costuming, sculpting, woodworking, material sciences, and special effects makeup over the years, and my thirst for knowledge has proved unquenchable. I\u0027m unhappy if I\u0027m not fulfilling my creative sphere in some way. I often pause to speculate how people spend their time and money outside of making cosplay or some sort of project. It has been my life for a while and I don\u0027t think I\u0027ll ever be able to shake my need to slap crap together and call it art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy I Need Your Help:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMaking my YouTube videos is actually really fun for me, but lot of people dread editing and don\u0027t share their builds or projects because it is so time consuming. Sharing the things I\u0027ve learned and getting feedback from people gives me a sense of connection with the community of people who share my passions, but shooting and editing the tutorial videos is an intensely tedious process. I make very little money from ad revenue; pennies per video, but I do it because I truly love\u00a0it. Having a Patreon helps stimulate my projects and the quantity and quality of my videos. Having a platform for backer support gives people an opportunity to support their artists through a monthly tip and it gives artists the financial stability to keep making art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a student who goes to school and works part time, the extra funds would really help stabilize and de-stress my work.\u00a0I\u0027m not asking for free money. I\u0027m asking people who love the work artists do, to see the value in it by setting the value themselves through the system Patreon has given us. Art is often a gift, but it is not priceless.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope the mad science experiments and crafty projects found on my channel will give you inspiration for your own cosplay filled future. If you find my work, helpful, educational, or entertaining, please consider donating as little as a dollar. The extra funds really help me pursue the work which I use to give back to the community and to you, patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat you can find on my channel:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been making fun cosplay videos since about 2007. I strive for high production value and try to set the bar higher each video with condensed and easily digestible educational content. The videos are 80% related tutorials for Cosplayers, LARPers, and Makers alike. The other 20% may occasionally be something nerdy and goofy, or diet, or culture, or community related that isn\u0027t a tutorial and that\u0027s why I set my Patreon as a monthly pledge system, because I didn\u0027t want my patrons to worry that I would upload 15 junk videos at once and drain their wallets (especially if I post a goofy video that\u0027s not a tutorial).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if you feel that the content is valuable, then you have the power to place whatever value you like on it. I am immensely grateful for the support of all my fellow artists and art lovers.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShare knowledge, spread love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~Marie\u003cbr\u003e"
