    "summary": "Hey loves!\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m so glad you found me here:) \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to tell you my story.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout a year and a half ago, I started a weekly video podcast called The REL Show. I had been looking for a new way to connect to my community of fans, because I realized there was only so much that I could fit into a 3 minute song, or a 30 second meet-and-greet. Throughout these brilliant and brief conversations, I realized \u003cu\u003eI had a lot more to say to you.\u003c/u\u003e  I wanted to keep the conversation going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo, The REL Show was born. And it worked! I was thrilled to see the little five minute weekly videos turn into a real two-way conversation between myself and the viewers. I\u2019d tweet out asking for episode topics, you\u2019d respond with some killer content ideas. I\u2019d end the videos with a question about what I\u2019d just talked about, and you\u2019d leave these brilliant comments that would blow my mind. The show went from getting a few hundred views per week to a few thousand.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHere\u2019s where the story gets not-as-great.\u003c/strong\u003e A while back, I had to take a break from filming The REL Show. This was a really hard decision-it broke my heart!- and I was blown away to see how many of you CARED and NOTICED and SAID SOMETHING. I realized that this show meant something to a lot of you, because everybody kept asking, \u201cWhere did The REL Show go?\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo I put the truth out there, the not-so-glamorus facts: Filming a new episode every week had become overwhelming, and was taking more and more of my time. We had spent money on lighting, sound, and a fancy camera, and it took a lot of time to learn how to make the show look good. Every episode was taking at least a whole day to research, prep, script, \u0026amp;  film-because, admittedly, we\u2019re not exactly film/podcast experts, but we still wanted it to look good for you guys. It got to a point where it\u2019d be up to the last minute and I\u2019d suddenly be like \u201cOmg crap we have to film The REL Show tomorrow!\u201d -and I\u2019d have *no idea* what I wanted to talk about. I didn\u2019t want to let you guys down so I\u2019d stay up all night putting something together.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kept going because I loved doing it, but I couldn\u2019t keep it running by myself, forever. The thing is, we do this podcast completely for free. In fact, it costs us hundreds of dollars to make each episode! Between touring, running Custom Catastrophes, working on music, and keeping in touch with the fans through Icon\u2019s and my personal social media, I realized it was getting a little out of hand to invest so much time and money into something that couldn\u2019t help pay for itself.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e--\u0026gt;And recently, it occurred to me that it didn\u2019t have to be that way. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThousands of people enjoy The REL Show every week, and I wondered\u2026.would they be willing to \u003cem\u003ebe a part of it\u003c/em\u003e? Would people be willing to go from \u003cem\u003ecasual viewers\u003c/em\u003e to \u003cem\u003eactive participants\u003c/em\u003e?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have decided to find out.\u00a0I have the passion. I have a head full of a million different ideas, topics I want to talk about, tutorials I want to make, issues I want to shed light on. I am ready.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need you. I need you!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you\u2019d be willing to support this thing with a couple bucks per episode, we could take this to a whole new level. This means better content for you, and more sanity for me:)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI\u2019m not charging for The REL Show-it\u2019s still free-I\u2019m just asking for your help.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf the show has helped you out in the past, if you like looking forward to a new episode every week, this is your way to be a part of it, and guarantee it continues to help inspire more people. What a great way to give back, and spread the love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin us.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBe a part of this beautiful artistic exchange. Let\u0027s keep spreading and growing The REL Show. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you for believing in me, for supporting me, for letting me make art. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI love you always!\u003cbr\u003exOxO,\u003cbr\u003eAriel\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePS-I\u2019ve put together some fun rewards, just to show you I love you, but I\u2019ve got a feeling most of you are so awesome that it isn\u2019t even about the rewards for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFAQs\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow does this work? I don\u2019t get it!!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u2019s how it works: You pledge an amount, say $5 bucks a video. (Thank you.). I generally release one video a week, 4 a month, so you\u0027ll be charged $20 at the end of the month (because this is less annoying then literally getting your account zapped for $5 every week). \u00a0I don\u0027t always manage to make weekly vid when we\u2019re on tour, despite my best intentions, because, well touring always screws with my best intentions. If I don\u0027t make a new episode that week, you don\u0027t get charged!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat if you feel SUPER INSPIRED at some point and release like ten episodes one month? Do I have to support all those?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNot at all. You can cap your amount-so even if I magically start making more than one per week (which would be awesome), you\u2019d be capped at, say $20 a month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat about people who pledge something, get their reward, and then UNPLEDGE? Can they do that??\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI suppose that\u2019s totally possible. But I have enough faith in humanity to believe you\u2019ve got a good heart, and wouldn\u2019t be here if you didn\u2019t genuinely want to help. I trust you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eREWARDS:\u00a0I\u2019ve put together some fun rewards, just to show you I love you, but I\u2019ve got a feeling most of you are so awesome that it isn\u2019t even about the rewards for you.\u003c/strong\u003e"
