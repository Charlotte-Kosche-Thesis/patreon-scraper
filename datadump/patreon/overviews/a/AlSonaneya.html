Such \"laws\" in fact have names, \u003cem\u003eAl Sonan\u003c/em\u003e. Hence the \u003cem\u003enatural\u003c/em\u003e name of this lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003eTo me, Al Sonaneya is an attempt at giving my children and all future generations a stab at surviving what\u0027s no doubt coming. But it requires \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of work.\u003cbr\u003eA year ago, I determinately redirected my entire life towards discovering and living by those sacred laws.\u003cbr\u003eWatch the videos on the page for more details on the lifestyle, the thought behind it, and why I decided it was best to start out by an alternative for agriculture.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow do I use your patronage?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m currently \"training\" as many plants as I can \u003cem\u003ewith my currently-very-limited resources\u003c/em\u003e to naturally bread the strongest of their kind \u003cem\u003enaturally\u003c/em\u003e -yes, I know I wrote it twice.\u003cbr\u003eI need some facilities and equipment that I\u0027m trying my best to do without, but that would seriously ease and speed up the by-default-long process.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSupport me in my endeavor to rediscover the best lifestyle.\u003cbr\u003e"
