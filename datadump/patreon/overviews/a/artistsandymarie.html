    "summary": "What exactly is Fiber Art? Well, if you look it up on the internet you\u2019ll find this definition: \u003cbr\u003e\u201c\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eFiber art refers to fine art whose material consists of natural or synthetic fiber and other components, such as fabric or yarn. It focuses on the materials and on the manual labor on the part of the artist as part of the works\u0027 significance, and prioritizes aesthetic value over utility.\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The Fiber Art Club focuses on Crochet (but we don\u2019t exclude other techniques). The main thing to remember is that Fiber Art does NOT exclude items that have a use, but the focus is on texture, skill, color use and beauty (prioritizes aesthetic value).\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 My heart has always leaned more into the realms of Fiber Art, crochet is my chosen craft. Because my heart led the way (for over 50 years) it has caused me to question what I\u2019m doing, to experiment with the standard techniques, and to play with materials that many others don\u2019t even think of.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 I come from a time WAY before the Internet when the best place to \u2018really\u2019 excel was in a Club, the BEST lessons were shared by All The Club Members, when Community was almost as important as the projects we were working on, and where we all strived for excellence and professionalism. That\u2019s my goal with the club.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eUPDATE\u003c/strong\u003e:\u00a0We now have a NEW way to bring our Club more into focus.\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eAn email list that solves the problem of getting information out. AND it\u2019s divided by our Tiers (see Tiers below). Now all you have to do is watch your email. Special classes? You\u2019ll get an email. New Patterns? You\u2019ll get an email. Special Guest Teachers? Yep, you\u2019ll see it in your email. Professional tips and tricks? Can all be shared right there as well. This solves a big problem I was facing as I felt like people were not being informed of all the fun stuff.\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eJoin us today, and start your adventure into the realms of Fiber Art.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
