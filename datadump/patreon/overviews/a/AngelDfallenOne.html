    "summary": "I want to start with thanking all my supporters. The hardest for me is to put myself out there. I am an old man with youthful dreams. Don\u0027t give up on me! It\u0027s going to be a crazy ride.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter 22 years of military service,\u00a0I have finally decided to do what most people have suggested for the better part of my life. Work. Well I do work full time actually! But people have told me that I should get out there and draw, draw Angel, Draw! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo the web comic idea, which I hope to have exclusive to Patreon and my supporters, is still one of my major goals. But I have been blessed with a chance to draw for the Zarfling Platoon and also be Chief Petty Officer of Operations. (CPOO) What the heck is that?!, you may ask. Well I working with another military veteran on several projects we want to bring you all. We are concentrating heavily in bringing educational games, books and comics to the masses. Travis Blair is the creative mind behind this great idea. We both have children of our own and can clearly see the void in this area. Yes there are plenty of games out there but hardly with the goal to educate and well as entertain. We also have 2 other web comics that I will share here and are available online as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWait there is more...MORE!?!\u003cbr\u003eI have been blessed with the opportunity to draw sketch cards for...Upper Deck Entertainment and Marvel. YEP!!!! Not too long ago I finished the Spider-man Homecoming set and just received word about 2 other sets!!!\u003cbr\u003eSo yes I am keeping myself busy. You know what they say about idle hands!.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo if I create anything, I will be sure to post here for all to see and some items will be exclusive to my patrons as well.\u003cbr\u003eRemember it\u0027s not just the destination but the journey. Can\u0027t help to dream that one day I will get some important commissions and put my creativity out there for all to see.\u003cbr\u003eHere are some links to peak!\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://zarflingplatoon.com/mythical-creatures-coloring-pages/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eColoring pages drawn by me\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also currently the illustrator on several web comics for FUBAR Medleys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://thezarf.com/category/medley/fubar-comics/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFUBAR comics\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003eAlso lending some art for Nathaniel Baker\u0027s comic book project\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/AgromaniaInk/posts\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eKnuckle Draggers\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e@zarflingplatoon #zarfling #veteran created\u003cimg src=\"https://www.instagram.com/angeldfallenone/\"\u003e"
