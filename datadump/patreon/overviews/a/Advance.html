    "summary": "Advance Driving School has been helping people learn to drive since 2011. We set up our YouTube channel in 2015 so people everywhere have a complete library of tutorial videos to learn from and improve their driving. We even reply to every question posted by viewers asking for help with their driving.\u00a0However, making these videos cost us lots of money! We\u2019ve had to buy several cameras, mounts, computer stuff, fuel and even a drone - so we need your support to keep this going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThis is why we\u2019ve set up Patreon - this is a way that people can support us by donating a small amount of money every time a new video is made. If you like, you can set a monthly maximum, and since we want to make the best quality videos possible we only intend to make 2 every month.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nIf you find our videos useful and want to help support us then you can choose to become a Gold, Silver or Bronze patron. We will post a special link so all Patrons can watch our new videos up to a week before they appear on YouTube. If you choose to be a Gold or Silver patron we will also thank you at the end of that months videos by name. In addition, Gold patrons based in the UK will be sent an exclusive branded pen to express our gratitude.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nOur first goals are to improve our editing software to help our ideas come to life, and another 4K camera would really increase the quality of the footage we shoot. Your donation will help us purchase this equipment, and also help drivers around the world!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nThank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
