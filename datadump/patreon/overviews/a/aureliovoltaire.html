    "summary": "Hi Everyone!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy name is Aurelio Voltaire. Those of you who know me already know that I make lots and lots of things! I started my career as a stop-motion animator (I made a bunch of the early MTV and SYFY channel station IDs ), I make animated films, comic books (Chi-chian, Deady, Oh My Goth!), I\u0027ve written several books (The Legend of Candy Claws, Call of the Jersey Devil, What is Goth? etc..) I\u0027m a touring musician and I\u0027ve released something like eleven studio albums (and several more EPs and singles) over the years. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d say I make the bulk of my living from making and performing music and I feel really privileged to be able to say that!!! In fact, I\u0027m really, really lucky to be making a living as an artist at all! I think I probably make it pretty clear (at shows, through social media, etc... ) that I know that would NEVER be possible without the support of those who like what I do. I run all of my own social media pages so that anyone can reach me directly. I run my own merch booth at shows usually, so that I can meet and thank each and every person who came out to the show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eUnfortunately though, things are changing. Fewer and fewer people are paying for music. What is maybe the most confusing part is that they haven\u0027t stopped loving it... they just don\u0027t see the point of paying for something that\u0027s so easy to find for free. A song by their favorite artist won\u0027t be worth spending 99 cents on, yet they\u0027ll still gleefully throw down four bucks for a coffee at Starbucks. Why?\u00a0 It\u0027s not because they love coffee more than music but because there really isn\u0027t any way to get the coffee for free. The unfortunate part though, is that many of these people, while being true, ardent fans of the work, are either not considering ( or I shudder to think, completely unconcerned for ) how this effects the artist\u0027s life or ability to continue making the art they claim to love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e(For the record, I\u0027m not talking about people who simply don\u0027t have the money. I\u0027m talking about those who do, but choose to spend it elsewhere. I think that\u0027s important to note as I have a huge audience of poor students (for instance) who are always welcomed to listen for free wherever they can!)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFewer people are coming out to shows as well. Rather than buying a ticket and coming out, many people will settle for watching the videos countless fans will shoot of the tour and post to Youtube \u003cbr\u003e( for the record, I\u0027ve never prohibited filming or recording of my shows and I\u0027ve always encouraged people to share those videos on-line). Is it the same experience? Of course not! But it\u0027s free... and because it\u0027s on the internet, it means not having to put on pants, not having to leave the house and not having to interact with other people. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLastly, in the trifecta of what has made this year the hardest financially on my ability to continue doing what I do is that it seems fans are buying less and less merch. There can be a dozen different reasons for this, mind you, and I promise you that I\u0027ve explored the issue from every possible angle. But I\u0027ll present you with this one single example:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis year was my 17th Dragoncon in a row (Dragoncon is a convention in Atlanta that draws 80,000 people, where I perform to roughly 6,000 people at a time). At the risk of sounding overly proud, I would boldly say that in my 17th year, I was a more popular attraction than ever before! I performed for thousands of people, I signed hundreds upon hundreds of con badges and I took more photos and selfies with fans that I ever have in any previous year. The punchline?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e... my team crawled away from Dragoncon this year barely being able to cover expenses!!!! For the first time in years, the amount of money that we made selling merch (which is the only way you make money as a band at Dragoncon) was roughly the same amount it cost to manufacture the goods to sell, ship it there and pay for food and airfares. It was... well... SHOCKING, to say the least. The year before was kind of bad and we were all really surprised, but this year was just demoralizing and very, very confusing. How could people be so effusive about how much they love the music, but not want to take any of it home (or a T-shirt, poster, book, toy, etc)?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then this happened... a very nice man (with his wife and two children) approached my booth. He handed me forty dollars. I accepted it and asked him what he was buying from the booth and if he\u0027d like to have it signed and he said, \"I\u0027ve been standing here for a while watching you. You greet everyone with a smile, you take photos with people, you\u0027ll sign their badges or anything they hand you, and I\u0027ve seen that the great majority of these people aren\u0027t buying anything. I don\u0027t think they realize that the only way you can make money on tour is if they buy something. So, please take this money. I don\u0027t need anything in exchange, I just want you to keep being able to feed yourself and your family and keep making the music we love.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWow! I was really blown away and wasn\u0027t sure what to say. I, of course refused to take his money because it seemed really alien to accept what seemed like a donation... but he was very persuasive, bless his heart! It was at that moment that I realized that some people understand what we musicians and artists these days are up against, and some simply don\u0027t.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had heard about Patreon a while back. I\u0027ve had some colleagues suggest I join it. I\u0027ve had some fans suggest it as well. But I was not ready. I felt like it was akin to begging ( I guess maybe I should have read Amanda Palmer\u0027s book? LOL! )\u00a0 Then recently I was having a conversation with a friend about how musicians only thrived, many years ago, because they had patrons. People like Mozart were only able to produce art (and support themselves!) because there were generous people who loved their work and wanted to see them be able to continue creating it. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd then suddenly in didn\u0027t seem so bad. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so now I ask you if you will join me. Do you enjoy what I create? Would you be willing to help me continue to be able to create it? Because truth be told, I think we have reached that place in history where only with the help and support of people like you, will music and art continue to thrive... especially the kinds of art that would not be so palatable to corporate sponsors. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn exchange, I promise you that I will work hard to continue making what you\u0027ve hopefully enjoyed from me thus far. And I will never for a moment allow you to feel I don\u0027t appreciate your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd naturally, I will try my best inundate you in entertaining things in the hope that every month feels like a month worth contributing to the cause!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you can help in this VERY direct way ,let\u0027s make some spooky (possibly funny... possibly tragic... most likely a bit of both) ART!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd if you simply can not, know that I still truly appreciate your love, your enthusiasm and that you enjoy my music and art!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAurelio Voltaire\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"

     "about": "Aurelio Voltaire is often described as a modern day renaissance man. He is a singer/ performer, creator of comic books, animation and toys.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAn internationally touring musician, he is at the forefront of the Gothic, Steampunk and Dark Cabaret genres headlining some of the biggest horror, sci-fi and comic book conventions as well as Gothic and Steampunk festivals for nearly two decades. His music can best be described as a collection of murder ballads, tongue-in-cheek exercises in the macabre, with just enough bawdy songs about Star Trek and Star Wars to keep a convention audience rolling in the aisles. Many know him for his songs \"Brains!\" and \"Land of the Dead\" from the Cartoon Network show \"The Grim Adventures of Billy And Mandy\".\u2028Voltaire\u0027s live shows, whether solo or with his skeletal orchestra, are full of stories and games. Many describe his shows as sitting around a fire while an old friend regales you with tales, presuming that old friend drinks a liter of rum a night, dates zombie prostitutes and wrestles Krakens.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVoltaire has been recording and touring for over 20 years.

The company that ran the building went out of business and frankly, any space of a similar size in the same area was over twice the price. I simply couldn\u0027t afford to set up anywhere else. Hence, I\u0027ve decided to close the webstore soon and to put all of my inventory into storage. Storage is going to cost $400 a month (yeah, welcome to NYC)! While putting the inventory into storage is not as desirable as having an office and being able to continue packing your orders myself, making little doodles on your packages and stuffing them with all sorts of stickers and other goodies.. it at least allows me a place to keep everything so that I can still bring merch to shows AND it allows me to be able to continue making MORE merch (like the commander of unicorns medals for instance) because I\u0027ll have a place to store them!\u003cbr\u003e",

     "description": "I don\u0027t think most people realize just how expensive it is to make a record in a studio. I spent $85,000 making Raised by Bats!!! And believe me when I say, it wasn\u0027t because we drank champagne like it was water (though that does sound nice, come to think of it!). It\u0027s because studios are expensive. They have lots and lots of expensive gear that you need to get the best recordings and a great studio has trained personnel that have spent a lifetime learning their craft to know how to do it well. I believe that\u0027s worth paying for! I also rarely record alone. I very often have great musicians playing drums, violin, accordion and a host of other instruments. Now, I know there are plenty of people out there that don\u0027t think musicians need to be paid... or maybe should be satisfied with a six pack of beer and a pat on the back, but I AM NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE!!! These days, I generally pay any musician that comes to record Union Scale for a side man. That is roughly $475 for a three hour minimum. That\u0027s what the union thinks is a living wage... and I AGREE! I think that if someone spent their whole life learning to play an instrument and getting to the point where they are one of the best, they deserve to make a living from that. When I go into a studio to record, it\u0027s often with one instrumentalist, like say, a drummer. By the end of the day, I will have paid the studio their hourly rate and the drummer his living wage.. but I will walk away with three or four songs that now have drums and sound GREAT!... great enough to share them with YOU and know that I\u0027m giving you the very best instrumentation and recording I can afford. I have a full album ahead of me and some other random songs I\u0027d like to record for you. Help me get into that studio to make that music happen! ; )\u003cbr\u003e",
