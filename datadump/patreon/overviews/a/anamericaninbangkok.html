For the past twenty-three years, I have been living in Thailand as an author and photographer. \u00a0In addition to my photography projects, I also make YouTube videos. Over the course of nearly four years, I have produced over 600 YouTube videos, providing information and entertaining thousands of people from around the world and answering thousands of questions in an effort to bring Southeast Asia closer to people around the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.anamericaninbangkok.com/uploads/1/1/5/4/11541996/img-0307_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(227, 108, 9);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhy I Need Your Support\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eProducing videos and taking photographs is a full-time endeavor. Every day I research, develop, shoot, and edit videos and photographs so that my subscribers can view my work. The extremely modest revenue I earn for uploading YouTube videos goes right back into my work. Patreon is a superb method of garnering support for artists of all types. You will continue to receive the same content, as well as some first run and exclusive content, plus other rewards depending on the amount of your contribution. Please check the list of specific rewards for each contribution amount. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.anamericaninbangkok.com/uploads/1/1/5/4/11541996/20140122-dsf5663-2_orig.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eWhat You Get\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to bring cool information and the interesting culture of Thailand, Southeast Asia, and other select areas of the world via guerrilla-style videos, podcasts, and photographs for your entertainment and edification...of course, in my own inimitable manner. You\u0027ll get the same slightly outlandish videos with improved production quality and a broader range of subject matter. You\u0027ll also see higher quality in-house videos and an increased number of videos shot out in the field. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor those who want to get their name or their company\u0027s name out, my YouTube channel has approximately 12,000 subscribers and my Facebook page has just over 2700 followers. These numbers are growing quickly. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn addition to providing videos and photographs from Thailand, I was recently in Kathmandu, Bali and Phnom Penh and in the next year, I have projects planned in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Ecuador, the US, and Japan, and of course, I\u0027ll be producing short YouTube videos related to each destination. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt best, you\u0027ll learn a whole lot and be entertained...or you might get to see me slip and fall on my face. Anything can happen! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.anamericaninbangkok.com/uploads/1/1/5/4/11541996/20151201-000006-2_orig.jpg\"\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(247, 150, 70);\"\u003eVideo Milestones\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy goal is to create videos and photographs that truly matter. It takes money to create projects, whether short or long-term. A dollar or two from my subscribers can go a long way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are interested in supporting me, \u003cem\u003eplease\u003c/em\u003e do not feel obliged. My YouTube videos are and will always be free, but if you have the money to spare and want to become a bonafide patron of mine, I am extremely grateful. In fact, I\u0027m grateful for all those who watch my videos! Either way, thanks for following my efforts!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor more details on becoming a Patreon Patron, please take a look at \u003ca href=\"http://www.patreon.com/faq\"\u003ethe FAQ page!\u003c/a\u003e :) Thanks again!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://www.anamericaninbangkok.com/uploads/1/1/5/4/11541996/000022_orig.jpg\"\u003e"
