    "summary": "YEAHHHH!!! Thank you so much for taking your time to visit my Patreon page :)\u003cbr\u003e\nYou know I\u0027ve been sailing around Europe trying to live as off grid and humble as possible. Using windturbines, solar panels, sails and a fishing rod.\u00a0Showing you don\u0027t need much to travel and be one off the happiest people on earth :)\u003cbr\u003e\nSailing the world, making/editing videos and taking you along on my adventures is what makes me happy. Sharing my adventures, reading and responding to your comments turn a smile on my face\u00a0every day :) \u00a0But, I want to make them better!! Now everything is shot by my old iPhone 5, a Gopro and toy drone, whahaha, yes serious.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nSo through Patron I hope to have found a way that allows me to renew my cameras and upgrade my video and editing skills. As well as creating a more personal connection with you by sharing non edited videos, vlogs and photos for Patrons. I would love to have some Patrons aboard to come sailing with me and experiencing the freedom and beauty of living on board.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\nSo if you enjoy my videos, appreciate the time I put in making them and want to show your support: you can now easily do so by becoming a Patron for already $1. You as Patron will allow me to sail further, longer and make more and better videos. You could not make me any happier! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003eSo If you can spare $1, click that Red button right top and become a Patron now!\u00a0(A bigger donation is also possible off course ;)\u003cbr\u003e\n\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
