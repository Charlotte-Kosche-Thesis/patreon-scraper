I also make videos on LGBT+ history called Queer History that not only explores topics related to history, but shipping in general.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eMore support means higher quality videos! Also, given the amount of copyright claims, a lot of my Youtube income gets taken away, so another source of income would be helpful and easier in making the videos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat do I get out of supporting you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eIf you support me, you get to vote on video topics, or even SELECT video topics that other people can vote on. Also get put into the credits of my videos, and get your name out there.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow often do you make videos?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAt the very least, one video a month, either Queer History or Are They Gay?. At the most, two a month, but this all depends on my schedule, which is often busy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
