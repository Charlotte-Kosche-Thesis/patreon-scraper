     "about": "Andrew Burns is generally known for his skills as a \u201csocial-delinquent,\u201d\nand occasionally, a composer.  He is\nsaid to have shown a very early musical prowess, and his parents describe him\nas having a gift for \u201cpounding on things incoherently.\u201d  His first real foray into music began when he\nattempted to learn the guitar at the age of 13. \nDesiring to use this as a way to \u201cwoo\u201d women, he quickly gave up on the\ninstrument when he realized no amount of playing would be able to help him.  His eventual move into composing began\nshortly after as a means to numb out the voices of his imaginary friends, and\nbecause it was a moderately acceptable excuse to be antisocial.  It was through these early compositional\nexplorations, with keyboard synthesizers and computers, that he had realized\nthat he had found his true \u201ccalling.\u201d \nThis had continued for several years until he had eventually discovered\nthe most insidious of creative-arch-nemeses: surviving on minimum wage.  His musical influences are widely credited as\nbeing: the sounds of orca whales mating, and the profound lyrical content of\nthe song \u201cIce Ice Baby.\u201d  His own musical\nstyle is typically equated to the sound of a broken air conditioning units, and\nthe gentle call of livestock dying in the distance. But seriously, he just\nloves creating music. \u003cbr\u003e",
