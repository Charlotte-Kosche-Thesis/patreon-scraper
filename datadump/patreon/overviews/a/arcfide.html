    "summary": "Welcome to my Patreon page! I am a Computer Scientist, but I like to think of myself as a Computing Artist. I am passionate about computing and the possibilities that come with it. Education, particularly open education for those who may not be well served by traditional classroom methods, means a great deal to me. I want to encourage a direct funding model of open research. The Co-dfns project is committed to delivering production quality ideas in an open manner, but to do so, I require support. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://www.github.com/Co-dfns\"\u003eCo-dfns\u003c/a\u003e project currently receives significant support through a close and productive partnership with\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.dyalog.com/\"\u003eDyalog, Ltd.\u003c/a\u003e and I am grateful for their support. But to really move the Co-dfns project forward, we need broader support from the wider community.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy vision for computing is an open world in which people value and treasure the power that comes from understanding computation as a liberal art. I seek to improve the state of computer science education through careful, out of the box research into systems design, human-computer interaction, and programming languages. I think it\u0027s important to make high-quality, forward looking, scalable computing accessible not only to professional software developers, but to knowledge experts, students, artists, and the wider community at large.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis requires new tools, better languages, and a new, fresh approach to education, and I\u0027m hoping you\u0027ll help me achieve the potential of a richer, more accessible computing world. I have big plans, but the world does not run on dreams and lofty aspirations alone. I have created this page in the hope that you will join me on this journey and become a part of making computing easier, more powerful, and more accessible.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have tried to develop a set of rewards as a way to thank you for your support. I look forward to hearing from you!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
