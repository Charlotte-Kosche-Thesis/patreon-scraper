I have the big goal of one day just living off my art and I\u0027d like to call the creation of this patreon the first great step towards it.\u00a0Currently, I have a 20h/week job at minimum wage at a pub. I work in the evening+night, which is pretty okay since I can do my art stuff just before I go to work. I didn\u0027t go to college and I also don\u0027t want to - after years and years of having a drained will to even exist, I don\u0027t want to do anything school-related again. Maybe it\u0027s harder to gain financial independence without learning a job or going to college or whatever. But maybe it\u0027s the easier way for me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI like realistic fantasy.\u003c/strong\u003e Realistic in terms of the problems the people face, how they live, how they act. Not the kind of \"you can\u0027t have more than two queer people in a small village\", because I\u0027m not a fuckboy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/854e/f/2017/290/d/3/inktober__3_by_anniefliesaway-dbqvflj.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy Projects\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have a hand full of projects. Possibly thanks to ADD, I need to have at least eight different projects to do at the same time so I can frequently switch. But the most important thing to know is that I love to tell stories. I always wanted to do comics, since it combines drawing with story telling, but comics are hard and you have to go out of your comfort zone a hellish lot, so I mostly write. Sadly, it\u0027s in German and I am not really able to translate them into English.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e1. The Exhibition\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI haven\u0027t got a name for this project yet. I\u0027m calling it this way because it\u0027s for an exhibition here in (maybe) April, we\u0027ll see. It\u0027s nothing big and a rather small project, but I hold it very dear. It\u0027s something like a children\u0027s book + illustrations, so maybe one day if I find someone to translate it, I will post it here. When it\u0027s finished, I will definitely sell a few copies of the German one! On Patreon, however, mostly the illustrations will be uploaded. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eA young witch gets lost in the woods. Maybe it\u0027s time for a monster to help her.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://orig00.deviantart.net/eae8/f/2017/333/d/1/bildschirmfoto_2017_11_29_um_18_38_31_by_anniefliesaway-dbv84eq.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e2.

The Hora version we have now started in June 2016 and has been going on since. It\u0027s long an it\u0027s full of characters I love. Every episode has a different setting and I\u0027m super hyped for drawing this. Sadly, it will take a while until I can really start and invest time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eThe Gods have fucked up. Time and space are about to fall apart, as a hand full of supernatural creatures is sent to make everything okay again. But well. It\u0027d be too easy if it was just that.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://img00.deviantart.net/23e9/i/2017/334/7/d/hora_01_1_by_anniefliesaway-dbvaxdr.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e3. Writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWriting is super important for me as it\u0027s still easier than drawing comics. (Faster, at least.) At the moment, I have four different ongoing stories I regularly upload. Two of them are longterm-projects (Spieluhrlied \u0026amp; Aschenregen), one is a spin-off of Aschenregen (Days of Avasikuu) and the other one a compilation of RP-related short stories with a friend of mine. However, I have a few stories more I am not uploading currently because I have to edit them first. I\u0027m not planning to get professionally published because of reasons, hah. But I\u0027d like to do more illustrations for everything!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eI mostly write political fantasy stories about magic and war and broken people and a bit about dying ecosystems. Everything is disguised as teenage drama.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://pre00.deviantart.net/0b74/th/pre/i/2017/142/b/6/whispering_water_by_anniefliesaway-dba1v9e.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever.
