    "summary": "I\u2019ve enjoyed drawing for much of my life, but first became more serious about improving and expanding my talents around the time I was in high school, and began painting. My earliest sources of inspiration were other native artists and my great- uncle, Robert Kakegamic. I enjoyed watching the process as they brought their art to life, and it made me think about trying to do the same. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAt first I didn\u2019t feel I was very good, but I kept practicing by drawing fan art and continuing to study other artists work. Some of my other artistic inspirations are Japanese artists such as Naoko Takeuchi and Yoshitaka Amano.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLately I have increasingly begun to draw inspiration from music, ballads, and stories from other cultures besides my own. I find many things in these stories to be universally appealing and want to express and share them with others through my art. \u003cbr\u003eThis is another aspect of my art which in some ways ties back to my native heritage. Native woodland art is an art form which preserves the old stories and legends of my culture.  And I believe that it is important that my art should have a story in it or behind it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am probably one of only a few female, native artists.   However, being an exception rather than the norm does create some obstacles that I need to overcome.  \u003cbr\u003eOne of the largest obstacles I currently face is obtaining the funding needed for supplies in order to keep doing what I love most, namely creating beautiful art. \u003cbr\u003eYour support will aid me in getting supplies such as brushes, paint, blank canvasses and art paper.  These items will help me to hone my skill in order to grow as an artist, and to continue to explore and expand my talents.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
