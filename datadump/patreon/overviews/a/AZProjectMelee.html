I\u0027ve been working hard to give you guys Project M content, and I really, truly hate too be here begging, but driving to tournaments and buying equipment is not free. I drive to Phoenix on Mondays for Cyberzone, to Tuscon on Tuesdays for Smashing Discoveries, and back to Phoenix Wednesdays for The Pit. That\u0027s around 300 miles a week, not counting Saturday events . Extra money would go towards equipment for the stream; better cameras and a nice monitor are the top priorities right now. If we get a bunch of extra money we could fly the stream out to record matches at locals, we could fly other players out here, there\u0027s a lot of options. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEvery little bit would mean a ton, though I don\u0027t blame anyone who doesn\u0027t. The fact that you guys are here reading this means a ton to me, and I hope we can continue to exceed your expectations. \u003cbr\u003e"
