    "summary": "Greetings Compadres!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 My name is Amanda Kitchens, Native Texan, and I\u0027ve been working as a professional musician out of Austin for the past 10 years. I\u0027m an Accordionista, Vocalist, Songwriter, mediocre Guitarist, Bass Clarinetist, \u0026amp; a Sousaphone Slayer! I\u0027ve been living the dream for the past 5 years, having quit my job and hit the road, and I have no complaints whatsoever. The road\u0027s been kind to me and I\u0027ve met so many amazing people along the way. I\u0027ve mostly been seen around performing with a band called Vana Mazi. You can check us out at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://vanamazi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://vanamazi.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 We\u0027re currently on hiatus for the winter, thus I\u0027ve been using this time to focus on finishing up my solo album: If this is Love, Kill me Now. \u00a0It\u0027s been a year in the making and we\u0027re drawing ever nearer to completion. \u00a0Earlier this year I\u0027d considered launching a Kickstarter campaign for funding, but then opted to try to fund as much of it myself as possible. And I\u0027ve done a pretty good job. I\u0027m over $7,000 in and we\u0027re in the final stages of mixing. I\u0027ve also decided to try to get this done as close to my birthday as possible (Nov 21), so I\u0027ve finally decided to ask for help. That\u0027s where you come in. It\u0027s going to be at least another $5000 for me to finish funding this album and I\u0027d like to get there as fast as I can. I can tell you that I\u0027ve been dancing since I was 4 years old and been making music since the age of 7. I play for folks even when I\u0027m not getting paid. I put on a show even when no one\u0027s there to see it. I\u0027m truly passionate about my chosen profession and I\u0027ll do whatever it takes to continue doing what I love.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an excerpt from an article from Broadway World about Cosmicomics, a play I was Music Director/ Composer for working with Director Rudy Ramirez and the Austin Aerialist group, Sky Candy:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 \u00a0From the very beginning, one feels transported to a far away land with the perfectly-paired accompaniment of music director/composer Amanda Kitchens. This musical collaboration won me over from the very beginning and set a magical atmosphere that transformed the space with a free-spirited, European-fringe fest vibe. Ms. Kitchen\u0027s voice is lush and warm, and she has the visceral presence of French legend, \u003ca href=\"http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Edith-Piaf/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eEdith Piaf\u003c/a\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read the rest of the article:\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.broadwayworld.com/austin/article/BWW-Reviews-Sky-Candys-COSMICOMICS-Leaves-Austin-Starstruck-20140626#\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.broadwayworld.com/austin/article/BWW-Re...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e \u00a0 I\u0027ve performed with many different groups over the years, anything from bluegrass to Balkan, renaissance to reggae, and only a small handful of my songs have been performed by the bands I\u0027ve played in. That\u0027s why I decided to create a solo CD. I\u0027ve written a lot of songs over the years that don\u0027t fit into the Balkan niche that I\u0027ve found myself in as an accordionista, and I\u0027m tired of just leaving them to get dusty on the back shelf and not heard and enjoyed. And as the muse usually finds me during points of sadness, I feel that maybe some of these songs may help other folks when they find themselves in low points.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can see more about me at: \u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.amandakitchens.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://www.amandakitchens.com/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
