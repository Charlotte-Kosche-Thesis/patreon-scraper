Be it a texture pack - which you get access to a update, or a release before everyone else, see how the progress is going in the Discord, and perhaps, even contribute! Or a translation currently ongoing.(What can be revealed depends HEAVILY of what I am translating.)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you wish to know where you can find me, my Steam has a complete info box with contact, social media or sites that I officially use, the list of work/projects I have done, and a few more other things, so if you can, pay a visit to me\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AkiraPlays\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e!"
