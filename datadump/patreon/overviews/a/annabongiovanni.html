If I make this goal, then I will send everyone a comic about what happened the day after the last day of working in the service industry. It hasn\u0027t quite happened yet so I can\u0027t predict what it\u0027ll be exactly but here\u0027s some key words of what it\u0027ll probably feature: champagne, yelling, winter biking, crying, broken bottles, paint bombs, dancing, glitter, gay bars. I\u0027M EXCITED FOR THIS!",

This means MORE COMICS, more rad free things for everyone, more time for activism and making art that matters to me, and not needing to scramble for funding! Thank you all so much! As a thank you, I will draw THREE RAD QUEER TATTOOS for all of you to put onto your body! Or three rad illustrations for you to print off and frame if you\u0027d rather them not permanently on your own body. I will also turn them into stickers and mail these stickers out to all of you.
