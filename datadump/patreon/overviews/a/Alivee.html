I am here for you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eWhat is this Patreon you speak of?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePatreon in itself is a way that allows you, the patron, to be able to support and cheer me on! For me, a creator, I get the chance to provide SUPA SECRET and EXCLUSIVE (for your eyes only) tutorials, art process, sketches that I am too scared to show anyone else and insider knowledge on all my projects I\u0027m ramping up for! It\u0027s super cool and exciting to be able to have just a few folks to share this with, and give you something fun and interesting to look forward to in the buzz of the day to day. Check it out! Even if you just hang out for a couple months, it will be definitely fun and worth it. :D\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eSoooo who you tho?\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a full time 3D artist who works in Orlando during the day. During the other times, my true passion is to make people smile, and to express myself in new and mysterious ways with my art. I am a person who inspires others, and I want to spread that contagion to the world and brighten up someone\u0027s day! I enjoy working on all aspects of art, from painting, digital to 3D. I want to be the type of artist that can show that anything is possible, and to help encourage new artists to never, ever give up!!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003eDas naice. So how does this thing work?\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOnce you sign up by choosing a pledge amount on the right side, the payment for the pledge is processed during the first week of every month. Rewards will be posted on every 15th of the month. Postcards for the $10 bracket patrons will be sent out after your pledge. So, IE: if you pledge in January for the January postcard, you\u0027re going to get that postcard mid-Feb. You can cancel your pledges at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cb style=\"\"\u003e\u003c/b\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eI am here to help answer questions! email me at alivolkmar@gmail.com for more info!\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you so much for stopping by, and have an excellent dayyyy~ \u0026lt;3\u003c/strong\u003e"
