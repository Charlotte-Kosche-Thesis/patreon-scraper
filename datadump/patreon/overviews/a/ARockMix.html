But here I am, asking for your help!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I\u0027m not asking you to start paying me for what I\u0027ve been doing for free for the better part of a decade. I\u0027m simply asking for your help in keeping the podcast moving forward.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe cost of doing a podcast isn\u0027t free. Once upon a time it was, but people (media hosts, website hosts, etc.) got greedy. And, on top of that, equipment (microphones, hard drives, digital recorder, etc.) gets old and used, and needs to be repaired/replaced/updated.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd THAT is what your help is needed for. I\u0027ll be doing the show regardless, but I can only do it as long as my technology allows me."
