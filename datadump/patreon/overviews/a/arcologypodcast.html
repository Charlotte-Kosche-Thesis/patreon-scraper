That\u0027s why we\u0027re turning to you. With patronage, we can always produce the shows, regardless of our personal income streams. With enough patronage, we can devote more time to the show: increase the audio quality, create more content, spiff up the website, write more stories, run more contests... you get the idea.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks for visiting and we hope you\u0027ll consider supporting the show!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e-Vox and Mr. Johnson\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eP.S.
