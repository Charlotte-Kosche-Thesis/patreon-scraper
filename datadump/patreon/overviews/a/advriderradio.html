    "summary": "Thanks for stopping by! We\u0027re Jim \u0026amp; Elizabeth and for the past three and half years we\u0027ve been producing Adventure Rider Radio (ARR), a free downloadable motorcycle podcast. It\u0027s been somewhat surreal for us, as it\u0027s grown leaps and bounds with over 1,000,000 downloads in the past year. We are so grateful to our listeners for showing up every Thursday and for spreading the word about ARR.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have had many truly inspiring guests on, sharing travel stories, tech info, riding skills, and more. We\u0027ve expanded a bit, producing another free podcast, ARR RAW (www.adventureriderradio.com/raw), roundtable discussions between some of the top names in the industry. At times funny, laugh out loud commentary, and always great information about motorcycle travel.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe absolutely love what we do, and we work really hard to bring the best quality moto travel podcasts to our listeners. It\u0027s quickly evolved in to a full time gig for the two of us, researching, editing and producing the show from just a thought right on through to when it airs. Yep, it\u0027s just the two of us, wearing many hats.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd of course, it doesn\u0027t come without expense. The costs for production include internet fees, website costs and podcast hosting fees, software, recording equipment and computers, and more, it all adds up. Plus, we have to live too!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have been fortunate to have some great sponsors on ARR, and make a small living off the podcast ads, but it\u0027s not enough to pay the bills, keep up with all the expenses and to purchase the necessary equipment to produce the show (we are still saving for a new computer that is adequate for audio production, as the one we use for recording is 8 years old!). Producing ARR is simply not sustainable for us without the support of our listeners, and we really appreciate all who have contributed so far.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd wouldn\u0027t it be great if we could get enough listener support that we don\u0027t have to worry about advertisers? We could put the time that we put in to getting and maintaining advertisers in to producing the show instead. Ultimate goal: Ad free, listener supported show.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you are able to help out even just a little, it means we can keep improving, growing and producing Adventure Rider Radio and ARR RAW.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks so much \u0026amp; ride safe,\u003cbr\u003eJim \u0026amp; Elizabeth\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.adventureriderradio.com/episodes-motorbike-podcast-radio-show/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eListen to Adventure Rider Radio\u00a0\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://www.adventureriderradio.com/raw\"\u003eListen to ARR RAW\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
