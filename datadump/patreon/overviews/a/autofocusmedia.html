It has changed a lot since those days, and now it\u0027s functioning as a motorsport blog site. Currently, I am the only writer, but I want to see AutoFocus grow. My dream for the site is for it to bring together writers from all over, covering whatever form of motorsport interests them the most. Talented people talking about their passions, be that engine developments in Formula One, the next generation of prototype in endurance racing or even what Sebastien Vettel had for breakfast. Okay, maybe not that last one, but you get the idea. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ca href=\"https://www.autofocus.media/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eCheck out AutoFocus if you haven\u0027t already.\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eWhy is AutoFocus on Patreon?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s all well and good me writing things, but: \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eI\u0027m just one person, how interesting can I be?\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eI have a job so I can\u0027t write all the time\u003c/li\u003e\t\u003cli\u003eNobody likes adverts, so I want to avoid using them on the site if possible\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003eThere\u0027s probably a host of other reasons I could come up with, but three is a good number so I\u0027ll stop there.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003eI want to make AutoFocus the best it can be - a real hotspot for superb (and sometimes a little different) motorsport content. However, I can only do it with YOUR help. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat will AutoFocus do with your money?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eFirstly, site costs. \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThat might sound trivial, but even just covering those makes a big difference - it\u0027s one less thing that I have to worry about. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNew contributors.\u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr\u003eAs I\u0027ve said, I want AutoFocus to be more than just me writing articles. I\u0027d love to hire another writer, or even just have enough money to pay people for guest posts. So, the more money you put in, the better and more varied the content available to you. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eNo adverts!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNobody likes adverts. They are a fact of life, but I\u0027m sure if we could, we\u0027d get shot of them. Well, that\u0027s what I\u0027d like to do. Ideally, AutoFocus will make money, and the go-to solution for achieving that would be selling advertising space. But what if you guys could make AutoFocus ad-free? Good news! You can. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhat\u0027s in it for you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAll patrons will get early access to articles where possible, exclusive blogs and access to the AutoFocus discord server. And of course, endless gratitude from me! \u003cbr\u003eThis Patreon is somewhat of an experiment, so things might change as I figure out what I\u0027m doing. I will be asking for feedback on the discord, as well as asking you lovely lot what sort of content you want to see. So if you think of something you would like to see either as part of the Patreon or the site itself, then do let me know! \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eAnyway, if you can support AutoFocus, then fabulous, thank you!
