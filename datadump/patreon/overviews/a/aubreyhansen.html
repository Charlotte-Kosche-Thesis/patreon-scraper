Whether you\u0027re an old friend or new to the party, the fact that you were interested enough in my books to say, \n\u003cem\u003e\"Hey, I should check out her Patreon,\" \u003c/em\u003emeans a lot to me. It also probably means that we have similar tastes in fiction, which means you should totally stay, help yourself to a cupcake, and snuggle up in a chair with a good book! At least, I think they\u0027re good books... And for just $1, you can read\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\u00a0\u003c/i\u003eall of them and see for yourself!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWho are you?\u003c/h4\u003e\nMy name is Aubrey Hansen, and I\u0027m a twenty-something wife/cat mom from Kansas City. I\u0027m a homeschool graduate and full-time Bible college student. And, most relevant to this discussion, I\u0027m an\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://aubreyhansen.com\"\u003eauthor\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://penoaks.com\"\u003eeditor\u003c/a\u003e, and\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://childthemovie.com\"\u003efilmmaker\u003c/a\u003e. I write clean speculative fiction for middle-grade and YA.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eWhy are you giving away your books for $1?\u003c/h4\u003e\nBecause I\u0027d rather make friends than readers. When you join my club on Patreon, you get a good deal; you get access to all of my titles for less than it would cost to buy them from the bookstore. But I get a good deal, too. By having the regular support of my Patreon team, I can spend more time on writing new books and less money on advertising. Instead of throwing thousands at annoying ads, I can put that investment into art, exclusive editions, and other rewards for the readers who support me on Patreon--the people who already know and love my books.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4\u003eHow does this work?\u003c/h4\u003e\nCheck out the reward tiers on the right and choose the package which appeals to you most. Each tier represents a monthly pledge, which you can edit at any time. Everyone gets instant access to all of my published ebooks, so if you just want to chip in $1 and hang out for awhile, come on in! But for different pledges you can also get access to my WIP, signed paperbacks, and even exclusive, not-for-sale collector\u0027s edition hardbacks! The party\u0027s just getting started--all it\u0027s missing is \n\u003cem\u003eYOU!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
