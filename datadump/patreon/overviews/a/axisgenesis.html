I\u0027ve come a long way to get to the point where I was comfortable putting my name out there. Since stepping up to do artwork and craft projects as a more serious occupation I\u0027ve been working hard to achieve a level of satisfaction where I can share my efforts and undivided time with the world as a full time means.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn between commission work I also stream at least three times a week on Twitch to be able to connect with my audience on a more personal level. I feel that engagement and relation with the people that have done their part to support me down this long road deserve the time and attention. As such I make it a point to share this time with them and make appearances so that I can get to know the people who have been patting me on the back through the good and the bad.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor the moment I also work a part time side job on top of everything else just to make sure the bills are paid in good time. Hopefully with your help and continued support I can make changes that would allow me to pursue content creating and streaming full time as an occupation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith all that said,\u003cbr\u003eThank you for your time and considerations\u003cbr\u003eShout out to all you awesome people \u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e"
