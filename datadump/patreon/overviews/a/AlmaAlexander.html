    "summary": "\u003cbr\u003eHi, my name is Alma Alexander, and I am a writer.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy head is full of stories. They will out. They NEED out. But as many of you know the publishing world is in a process of flux - and people like me, people who write things that don\u0027t necessarily fall into neat marketing boxes, people who write lyrical and lush, people who take the time to create characters who walk off the page and into your memories or worlds whch linger in your dreams, those people have always had a hard time trying to find their niche, and never more so than now.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMine are the words that need to go directly from me to you, my readers. So that\u0027s why I am here...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThere are stories I want to share. You can be here to catch them.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor as little as the price of a cup of coffee a month, you can be a part of a creative world. And you are supporting someone who lives and breathes and dreams by the word. I promise you, I will not disappoint you. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little about me - I\u0027ve been a full time writer for more than 15 years, with more than a dozen novels to my credit - they include internationally published bestsellers like \"The Secrets of Jin-shei\" (out in 14 languages worldwide), \"Embers of Heaven\", the YA fantasy Worldweavers trilogy, Midnight at Spanish Gardens\", the Were Chronicles (Random, Wolf and Shifter), the humorous SF novel \"Abducticon\", the newset lush historical \"Empress, the (I suppose best described as) paranormal romance \"Wings of Fire\" .... and in thre somewhere I\u0027ve edited two anthologies, \"River\" and \"Children of a Different Sky\".\u00a0 I\u0027ve been compared to Amy Tan, Gail Tsukiyama,, Octavia Butler, Haruki Murakami, JK Rowling, and others... and I\u0027ve also been called entirely original, and my own thing. Back when I was beginning my writerly journey the literary legend Roger Zelazny read one of my stories and told me, \"You have a voice all of your own. Nobody else will ever write this way.\"\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll keep writing. You can help. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWOULD YOU LIKE TO BE PART OF A CURRENT PROJECT?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am putting together a short story collection called \"Untranslatable\" - stories based on and inspired by words in various languages (ranging from Portuguese and Spanish to rare tongues like Inuit or that spoken in Tierra del Fuego) which mean things that it would require an entire descriptive paragraph of English to do justice to. Stories already in place range from older, already published tales to brand new and never before seen stories which have either not been published yet or have been written specially for this collection; I still have three story \u0027slots\u0027 to fill. Where do you come in? Become a patron at $5 or higher and you get to see the entire collection - here - before anyone else does. More than that, you help me fill those last three slots. Anyone pledging $10 or more gets a signed copy of the book when it comes out, free, with my thanks, and an option to purchase further copies at 50% off the list price. All patrons at $1.$2 or $5 levels don\u0027t get it free but they STILL have that 50% discount in place if they wish to purchase it. How about it? Want to help me put a unique collection together?\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBUT WAIT... THERE\"S MORE...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI may be embarking on a whole new cycle of novels, historical fantasies based on medieval history of the Balkans - my own history, my own back yard, it was only a matter of time before I went there, after all, and trust me - the story reads like Game of Thrones sometimes. Currently playing with Byzantium, the Ottoman Empire, medieval Serbia, Tamerlane and the Golden Horde... there is so much material here that I am still casting for a place to START. You want to help? For patrons $5 or higher, I will be providing insights... essays... research squibs... character outlines of the major players...possibly even glimpses of WIP as it begins to take shape. For patrons pleding $10 or more there will be special ofers on the eventual books, input on character development, possible (even if necessarily modified, given the name structure) Tuckerization\u00a0 in the novels or the option to pick a character name if a direct Tuckerisation is not possible due to linguistic barriers. Want to watch me build a world, write (potentially several) stories\u00a0 in this setting? Become a Patron!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
