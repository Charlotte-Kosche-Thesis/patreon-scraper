    "summary": "I\u0027d like to think of myself as an entertainer. Someone that people like you look forward to watching because my videos pluck at an emotion or intrigue your curiosity. If watching one of my videos can cause you to burst into laughter, captivate you in suspense, spark your imagination, expand your knowledge, or just bring a\u00a0smile to your face\u00a0then I feel like I\u0027ve accomplishing something wonderful.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen I first started creating videos I had no idea if it was something I\u0027d enjoy but I quickly discovered that I absolutely love creating videos, and even more than that, I found that interacting with all of you was an absolute joy. Something that was completely unexpected but has enriched my life beyond words.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDream to Dream\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI would like nothing more than to be able to focus on YouTube as my full time career. So I have the time, security, and means to craft even more entertaining videos, branch out into more games, and reach out to all of you in new and wonderful ways.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf one day, because of your support this dream becomes a reality, I\u0027ll be able to refocus all that reclaimed time and energy. Allowing for the creation of new series, expanding on existing series, bringing back old favourites, and even start up some daily series. I\u0027ll also be able to live stream more often and in more time zones. I\u0027ll dedicate time to building our community, opening up new and fun ways for all of us to interact with each other.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAchieving this goal will free me from the bonds of an inflexible calendar, allowing me to set my own schedule, and take advantage of each day to it\u0027s fullest. I\u0027ll be able to plan out each series in more detail and spend more time letting my creative juices free to explore new possibilities. I\u0027ll be able to spend a lot more time with my son, the primary source of joy in my life. He was also the singular influence in the birth of my channel, you have him to thank for any video you\u0027ve enjoyed. I\u0027ll even be able to jet off on a vacation from time to time, off to faraway places, and maybe even be able to share my experiences along the way with all of you. In short, thanks to all of you, I\u0027ll be free to live my life my way, which first and foremost means dreaming up and creating ever expanding stories for you though the videos I craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWell, it has become exorbitantly clear to me that trying to achieve this dream via YouTube Ad revenue is just not practical. Through my own personal observations and via the advice \u0026amp; coaching I\u0027ve been privileged to receive, this seems to be an overwhelming truth. Patreon allows you to support me directly, allows me to personally recognize you for that, and provides a clear picture of support that isn\u0027t obscured by complicated ad revenue algorithms.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow Can You Help?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA pledge by you, no matter how big or small, will be an amazing help to bring this dream closer to a beautiful reality. To an existence dedicated to producing the most entertaining and professional videos I\u0027m humanly capable of crafting.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePlease be aware that a pledge to me via Patreon is a monthly contribution, not a one time donation. As a heartfelt thank you, I\u0027ve done my best to craft a reciprocal pledge to you, in the form of rewards for each pledge tier.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI understand that not everyone is able to give support here on Patreon and that\u0027s completely understandable. If that is true for you then you can still support me by watching, liking, and sharing my videos with your friends, family, and anyone you think might enjoy them. You can also get involved in the comments and help grow our community making it a place people love to be. In the end, this is really what matters.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy videos on YouTube will always remain open and free for everyone to enjoy. Becoming a patron means you\u0027ll be helping me continue to make videos and one day even dedicate myself to the craft.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThank You\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI want to thank you. For the support you\u0027ve already shown me, because without your encouragement and kind words I wouldn\u0027t even have made it this far. For continuing to show me how amazing you all are, and being the cause for so much joy in my life. For, if you are able, becoming a patron and being the catalyst that allows for so much more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank You. For being amazing."
