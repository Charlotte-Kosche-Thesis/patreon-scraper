    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eA Therapist Walks Into a Bar\u003c/strong\u003e...and asks regular people questions about regular and not so regular thoughts, feelings, and experiences that impact us psychologically, stuff that\u0027s happening in our lives, both personal and collective.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhy a podcast? Therapy isn\u0027t the only place people talk about their lives or seek support. But everyone has stuff going on and often people actually want to talk about it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast gives listeners a chance to hear themselves in the people I interview and gain deeper knowledge by hearing experts weigh in on the regular stuff you might find yourself pondering with friends over a drink. I do this because I want you to know you\u0027re not all alone, I want you to feel like you\u0027re learning something new, and I want you to finish each episode feeling a little more curious/fascinated/hopeful about the big questions that vex you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ll cover diverse topics from relationship problems to socio-political issues like race relations. You know, stuff that impacts many of us a lot of the time.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis podcast is near and dear to my heart but it takes a lot of time and energy to make it happen. It\u0027s become 3/4 of my job. Also, I\u0027d like to be able to do things like pay some of the other people helping me out like an editor or sound engineer so I can produce even more quality content. Your support will help me keep delivering this juicy stuff to your thirsty ears.\u00a0"
