When you become a patron of the Agony Booth, you can choose to donate anywhere from $1 to whatever your heart desires every month. And you can opt out of donating at any time.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"background-color: #f1dbad; color: #870003; margin-top: 25px;\"\u003eWhy should I become a patron?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n        If you become a patron, you\u2019ll be able to permanently \n            get rid of the \u201cBecome a Patron\u201d popup, get rid of all ads on the Agony Booth (including the footer ads on mobile devices), \n            or include your own link in the site footer, depending on the amount you contribute.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n        But more importantly, you can support\u00a0the Agony Booth\u00a0and show your appreciation for the amount of work that goes into keeping it updated on a regular basis. \n            This website has been a labor of love for me since April of 2002, and I\u2019ll continue to work hard to provide free, quality content. But it would be great to \n            finally get a little something back for the hundreds of hours I\u2019ve poured into keeping the website running over the past 13 years. \n            If you\u2019ve ever been entertained by the Agony Booth, or found our articles interesting or useful, please consider becoming a patron through Patreon.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ch3 style=\"background-color: #f1dbad; color: #870003; margin-top: 25px;\"\u003eWhere does the money go?\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n        Primarily towards the operating expenses that I\u2019m currently paying for out of my own pocket, which are mainly hosting fees for the website, and the cost of renting movies to review/screencap. If there\u2019s enough patron support, I may look at providing monetary compensation to attract more writers, so that we can post even more written content than we do now. But the most important thing your donation will do is to motivate me to improve the site, with more frequent, high-quality articles.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
