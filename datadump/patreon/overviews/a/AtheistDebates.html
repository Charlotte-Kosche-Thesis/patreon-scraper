    "summary": "I\u0027ve spent the past decade engaging believers and apologists on live television, in e-mails, on forums and from stages at universities and conventions, but my time has always been limited by the number of vacation days I could take from my day job.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027d like to try to change that, but more importantly, I want to continue to produce content that helps people become more comfortable and more effective at defending their views.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith this Patreon project I\u0027m going to be producing better content aimed at teaching people how to better recognize and respond to arguments - and you can help!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m going to start with comprehensive treatments of not just the classical arguments for the existence of god but all of the common apologetic arguments and claims that you\u0027re likely to hear from believers, including appeals to prophecy, tradition, popularity and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will allow me to not only produce the video content I plan to work on, it\u0027ll also allow me to dedicate more time to writing books, delivering lectures and engaging in formal debates.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour support will also give you a voice in directing the content I produce. Do you have questions you\u0027d like me to answer? I can do that. Are you having difficulty with a particular argument or tactic? I can try to help....with your help. In fact, alongside the initial series covering the standard arguments in varied forms, I plan to post videos answering questions that patrons have sent me.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
