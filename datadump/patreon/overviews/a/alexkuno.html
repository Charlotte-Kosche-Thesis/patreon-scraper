    "summary": "Welcome to my new Patreon project! I\u0027m a full-time artist and illustrator living and working out of my studio in the Lowertown Arts District in Saint Paul, MN. For over ten years I\u0027ve been focusing on developing a satirical, apocalyptic fairy tales series of mixed-media illustrations and sculptures collectively known as\u00a0\u003cem\u003eThe Miscreants of Tiny Town\u003c/em\u003e. If you\u0027ve stumbled across this page without having seen my work, here are a few examples (many more can be found at www.alexkunoartwork.com):\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5205bdbbe4b03ad27ab211cc/586f71c5f5e2312f879ddae1/586f71db440243d6ba7724ef/1483698676677/Tempest+Full+SS.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5205bdbbe4b03ad27ab211cc/5757c49a27d4bdf581dff1ba/57a7b452e6f2e1f140dd3085/1476324000238/Travelers+squarespace.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5205bdbbe4b03ad27ab211cc/56b13dc5555986e5770af5f6/56bd61e7356fb0356fa6fabe/1455253272064/Rosemary+Detail.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5205bdbbe4b03ad27ab211cc/56b13dc5555986e5770af5f6/56bd61f2356fb0356fa6fadd/1455253272104/Stormy+Weather.jpg?format=2500w\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf \u003cem\u003eLord of the Flies\u003c/em\u003e was created by Beatrix Potter, \u003cem\u003eTiny Town\u003c/em\u003e was originally conceived as a purgatorial spirit-place where wayward children were deposited and left to eternally create their own societies, moral codes and spiritual beliefs. I started it back then as a technical and brainstorming exercise to escape the drudgery of my miscellaneous office jobs at the time, but over the years I\u0027ve come to depend on that imaginary space not just financially, but to emotionally process our increasingly fraught and turbulent \"real\" world.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAs my work has gained an international following, I\u0027ve been overwhelmed by questions from viewers about my inspiration and philosophy behind the series, my creative process and artistic techniques. So now with the help of Patreon and your support, I\u0027m excited to introduce a brand new way to interact with my work and imagination.\u00a0\u00a0As a patron, you will have direct, exclusive access to my preliminary notes and sketches, get the chance to own original artwork and exclusive prints, see timelapse videos of my drawing and painting process and hear me talk about the ideas and inspiration behind the images as they\u0027re being made. In the end, you will know more about what goes into my commissions that my clients will! Your input and participation will have a direct impact on the direction of my new body of work, so I hope we\u0027ll be able to build and explore a new world together.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e"
