    "summary": "This year, I\u0027ve embarked on a science fiction serial about what the colonization of other worlds might, and should, look like. It\u0027s a post-abundance world, in which resources are scarce - no giant battleships or clomp-clomping mecha-soldiers, because those are, well, wasteful. It\u0027s a look at war the way it\u0027ll look tomorrow, not yesterday - wars fought less with humans and more with technology...you know, the way it looks today. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s a hopeful look at what colonization could look like, if humanity learns its lessons from all its failed empires - an expansion into other lands that\u0027s not about imposing a culture, ruling by force, giving into Kochism and stripping resources to the bone...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt\u0027s the product of my research into counterinsurgency doctrine, guerrilla warfare, the use (and misuse) of Special Forces, and artificial intelligence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOh, yeah. And there\u0027s lots of action, too. It\u0027s a tough galaxy out there. I\u0027ve published two episodes so far, \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00RWQ0TP6\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eScarcity\u003c/a\u003e\" and now \"\u003ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B015D8F1M0\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003eArtifice\u003c/a\u003e.\" I\u0027m definitely writing a total of five in the series, and possibly a prequel if the whole thing flies.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not the conventional military science fiction story, and while I build this world, I would love some help getting it off the ground. I have a proven track record of finishing projects as \"Brad Vance,\" author of gay romance and erotica, and under my real name, \"Orland Outland\" as well.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can read about the genesis of this project, and the research behind it, at\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://adamvanceauthor.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\"\u003ehttp://adamvanceauthor.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI think the best way to describe this series is to quote its one-star review (that\u0027s right) on Amazon from \"Scarcity.\" If this doesn\u0027t get you interested in the project, it\u0027s not for you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Rich are evil, corporations are bad, governments are bad, and religion is the worst. The conspiracy against renewable energies has doomed Earth. End of the world books have to be somewhat bleak, this one pretty much panned everything about the human race. The only good guys are adept at accepting other cultures, and have mixed race (conventions?) names for no rhyme or reason. There were no relationships really discussed, other than a transgender one, so all together the book came off as anti-establishment.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\"Technology level seemed weird. Interstellar colonization was possible, but stopping a fire, cleaning up trash, and preventing epidemics are not. A lot of emphasis placed on only one woman capable of running the world. Didn\u0027t really like anything about the book, no grammar or spelling mistakes was about its only positive.\"\u003cbr\u003e"
