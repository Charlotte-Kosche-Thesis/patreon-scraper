    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIf you are reading this, there\u0027s a good chance you\u0027ve already watched one of our videos. If that is the case, THANK YOU!\u003c/strong\u003e If not, before you keep reading, go to our Youtube page and WATCH!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOur content is unique and unlike the stereotypical plus size, beauty, or fashion vlogger: our content is as authentic and REAL as it gets. \u003cstrong\u003eWhile the Youtube business model works to pay content creators based on ad revenue, the Youtube Search algorithm is not designed to promote the creation of new and exciting content. Don\u0027t believe us? Try it yourself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSearch for plus size fashion or plus size haul and see the results. Yeah, you may get the latest uploads from the well known vloggers, but you won\u0027t find our content [or that of other new creators] until you scroll down multiple pages. And ask yourself, honestly, how is a year old Glitter and Lazers or SometimesGlam video more relevant than fresh, unique content pertinent to TODAY? Considering how fast paced and ever changing the worlds of fashion and beauty are, how does that make any sense? This doesn\u0027t just affect us, it affects dozens if not hundreds of content creators.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd that\u0027s the point of this Patreon, the only way that we will break the glass ceiling and create a mass cultural shift and CHANGE on Youtube, is to develop more and more content and create our own relevancy. \u003cstrong\u003eThe only way Youtube will be injected with revolutionary content that is honest and from the heart is to not knock the door, but out right break in\u003c/strong\u003e. Our goal isn\u0027t just our success, but that Youtube as a whole sees a change in which like minded and genuine people are at the forefront of content creation.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe have recently started, along side our traditional content, a weight loss and fitness vlog. This is an on going project that will upload content almost daily in addition to our passion and artistic content. By supporting us, you are insuring that we can focus on both our fitness goals and our creative ambitions. That means more videos, more vlogs, more HAULS, more experiences, more songs, MORE GIVEAWAYS!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur content will ALWAYS be what it is now. We won\u0027t sell out. We won\u0027t give in. We won\u0027t change.\u003c/strong\u003e You look at every aspect of our channel: the way we reply to comments, the lack of editing and filtering, the REAL winners of our giveaways, and you will see, if there is ONE channel to support on Youtube, it is ours.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAs always, best wishes, love always,\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eAlex and Danni\u003c/strong\u003e"
