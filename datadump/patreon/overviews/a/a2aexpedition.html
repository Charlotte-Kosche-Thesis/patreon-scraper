Our ultimate goal is to invest in creating overland campsites around the globe which we will hand build to be models of off-grid development and which will be self sufficient oasis\u0027 which other overlanders can help us manage in order to earn income for themselves and others and keep their wheels rolling. The camps will encourage local and international tourism and will be a hub for overland travelers to meet, repair their vehicles, share their skills with others and the local community which surrounds them. We will also set up an animal rescue and adoption center where we can give our lonely, furry friends another chance at life.",
