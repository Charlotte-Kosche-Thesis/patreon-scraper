    "summary": "Hello! My name is Ace Arriande, and I am currently working as a full-time web novelist. Most of what I write is heavily inspired by anime, manga, light novels, and visual novels. You will see themes and tropes common in those mediums throughout all of my stories. As for what type of stories I write, I mainly write fantasy and erotica (and often both at once). I\u2019ve also always been a bit of a hopeless romantic, so you can expect to almost always see romance in anything I write. I also have a huge soft spot for harems that are done well and more than just rip-offs of Pok\u00e9mon where the protagonist collects all the girls.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eMy dream is to make enough money to fully support myself with my writing and then to start working on visual novels. I\u2019m in love with the format of visual novels, so whether I join a team as a writer someday or start my own, it is one of my biggest goals. My other biggest goal? Scientifically turning myself into a tentacle monster, of course!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eIf you decide to pledge any amount of money to me, I pledge to you that I will be writing almost every single day in order to give you your money\u2019s worth. I do not only write when I am in the mood to, I do not let feeing sick or bored get in my way, and I do not abandon my stories. If you pledge to me, you will get rewards consistent in both quality and schedule.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003eThank you for taking the time to read this and thank you for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eCurrent Stories\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eNormal\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eThe True Endgame \u003c/em\u003e(Main)\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e[\u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/fiction/16550/the-true-endgame\"\u003eRoyal Road\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.honeyfeed.fm/novels/836\"\u003eHoneyfeed\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eMonday Monster Girls \u003c/em\u003e(Side) [\u003ca href=\"https://royalroadl.com/fiction/18092/monday-monster-girls\"\u003eRoyal Road\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.honeyfeed.fm/novels/838\"\u003eHoneyfeed\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003e???\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eErotica\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003eEro Dungeon Evolution \u003c/em\u003e(Main) [Temporarily Patreon exclusive]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cem\u003eFriday Monster Girls\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0(Side)\u003cem\u003e\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e[\u003ca href=\"http://www.hentai-foundry.com/stories/user/AceAlter/29253/Friday-Monster-Girls\"\u003eHentai Foundry\u003c/a\u003e |\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://www.honeyfeed.fm/novels/839\"\u003eHoneyfeed\u003c/a\u003e]\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eSocial Media\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://twitter.com/ace_arriande\"\u003eFollow me on Twitter!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cu\u003eCommission Info\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/u\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jfJ48jLpzWnKL-R8rWTq3blNxtEkefDo9siUSFuXSGc/edit?usp=sharing\"\u003eCheck here!\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
