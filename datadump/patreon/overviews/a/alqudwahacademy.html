We moved from an industrial area in Paya Lebar to the heart of Geylang and finally to the busy district of historical Kampong Glam. Each transition we made, we did it with the best of interest for the sake our our students. We want our classes to be of high-quality, accessible and free to reach out to a greater audience.\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWhen we were at 5A Pahang Street, we had to move out in less than year to the current space because we noticed that the space could not accommodate the current number of students. Upon moving, we had to take up the 2nd and 3rd floor due to same reasons. Fascinating enough, even with a total average space area of 3000 square feet, we are still facing the same \u2018positive\u2019 predicament; our student base is growing. We begin to realize that Muslims in Singapore crave the study of intellectual, academic, niched and  high-quality Islamic sciences. Topics that are covered by Islamic educational circles and universities around the Muslim world but contextualized, practical and palatable for the modern contemporary Singaporean Muslim.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Cherished Aspiration\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eIdeally, we dream of owning our own property, an aspiring premise to house our students with amenities sufficient to provide the needs of every student of knowledge. A huge auditorium, classrooms comparable to best education institutions, the most extensive and accessible Islamic Library in Singapore, well furnished and futuristic prayer area, a cosy book cafe/restaurant, a gymnasium suitable for Muslims and Muslimahs and the list goes on. A one-stop hub for Singaporeans to immerse themselves in a holistic Islamic experience; a community of learners and worshippers (technically, what mosques in Singapore should be but that can be discussed on a separate note).\u003cbr\u003eAs much as it is a long-term goal, we need a practical short-term solution to cater to the needs of our students.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Feasible Solution\u2026\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eThe mentioned circumstances gave birth to the STUDIO. If we could not provide a physical space  to accommodate the needs of our students then it is imperative that we venture out and utilize the virtual classroom. Alqudwah Academy Studio has been a successful outlet and outreach. Since its inception on the 11th of January 2017, our Youtube page has a total of 30,090 views from the video productions, most of the\u00a0viewership is from the lifestreams of Sessions, our weekly free classes.\u00a0Through our involvement in online productions, we realized that there is great opportunity to create and produce content; and deliver them in a manner that cannot be achieved through physical classes e.g. animations and visual aids. Indeed video is the tool of the future. But here lies the problem. Video production is costly.\u003c/div\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242);\"\u003eThe Impeding Problem(s)\u2026\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: justify;\"\u003eIn actuality, there are two hindrances:\u003col\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIslamic education as content is not really a great sustainable business model.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eEvidently, viewers are more inclined to watch online gamers, cat videos and hijab tutorials than watch videos about fundamentals of law and jurisprudence (Usul Fiqh) or Hadith authentications and its terminologies (Mustolah Hadith). That is the painful truth. Viewers are willing to pay and support entertainment channels rather than educational pages, more so Islamic content (unless you are Nouman Ali Khan but that is a different topic altogether).\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eVideo production is costly.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eWe do everything we can to keep costs low, but we require audio and video equipment,  props, dedicated researchers and writers, animators, editors, and production staff.

We have always been crowdfunded. We do not have investors and not once did we decide to take investors nor grants. The Academy is by the community and for the community, no one specific person owns Alqudwah Academy, it belongs to everyone and we have been appreciative of that.\u003cbr\u003eOur free classes will remain free for all and our YouTube channel will remain the same because that has always been our goal. We want to benefit as many students as possible but we need a select few to help us not only sustain but to \u003cstrong\u003eGROW\u003c/strong\u003e. That is the reason why we set up this PATREON campaign.\u003cbr\u003e \u003cbr\u003eIf anyone managed to read all the way here, we are extremely appreciative because you let us share with you our story. We would also love to extend our prayers to everyone who has supported us, physically, emotionally, spiritually and financially.
