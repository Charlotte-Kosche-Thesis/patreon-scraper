    "summary": "It has been my life goal to live on a boat and sail around the world. \u00a0I spent the past 12 years working as a Firefighter/paramedic to save up to buy my boat and live on the water...one day.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs they say, \"Life happens when your making plans\". \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOn the coldest night of the year I was injured on the job in 2013. While I was treating a patient, drug traffickers under the influence ran into me, my firefighter partner, and my patient at speeds estimated over 45 mph. \u00a0The crash broke my neck, with total damage C4-C7. \u00a0It has caused nerve damage in my upper extremities and to the left side of my body. I have a traumatic brain injury that resulted in cognitive loss of function (I can\u0027t read or write well today because of it. I used software to do it all for me the first 18 months after the accident), short and long term memory loss. \u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThrough neurological and cognitive therapy I came back to a semi normal way of functioning. \u00a0It has been three and a half years of pain. Massive weight gain and fighting depression while waiting on a much needed spinal surgery. \u00a0I loved my profession. \u00a0Now I have nothing left of the life used to know. No real help from the workmans comp insurance and disability is a joke. They spend more time not approving you for treatment than they do helping you. \u00a0It is like they really try to harm people more by breaking them down so they will want to give up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e If it was not for the love of my life who works as a Nurse Practitioner, I would not be where I am today. She took me in after I lost my career and placed on permanent injury status. I am stuck in the system waiting for spinal surgery or settlement. \u00a0I would not wish this broken system on my worst enemy.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI refuse to not live my life to the fullest. This is my second chance at life. I spent half my life living for my job. Which I am proud of and now I am going to spend whatever is left living for us. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I am making active strides in doing what I should have done 15 years ago. I bought a small sail boat (22ft) to learn to sail on. \u00a0I spent the past five months restoring it. I don\u0027t take medications because I don\u0027t want the long term damages to my liver. \u00a0So I go diving. \u00a0Being under water takes the pain away. The lack of weight and pressure of the water produces a sort of gentle traction to my spinal cord. \u00a0The deeper I go the less pain I feel. The pressure on my spine and the weight off, I start to feel more and sensation returns to my upper extremities. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 My fiance is working hard to pay bills and save money for her end. \u00a0We will refine our sailing skills this summer on Tahoe. The desk job I have now I am using to save money to go towards our future live aboard and the medical insurance will help me get real help, now. \u00a0I mainly started the channel because I love people. \u00a0I used to meet people everyday during their emergencies. I was good at earning people\u0027s trust. I was able to provide the right treatment because of it. \u00a0Now I just want to sail, rest, heal my body and soul. \u00a0Meet new people on the last chapter of my life. I was hoping the internet would be a great way to meet people prior to our journey and keep up with the friends we make along the way. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI will do this with or without help from strangers. \u00a0Because that is what people do when they want something. They find a way to make things work. They work for it. \u00a0If for some reason people out there want to do this type of donation stuff. It is appreciated because the equipment required to make great videos isn\u0027t cheap and editing almost feels like a job.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e;)\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn the mean time I look forward to meeting other sailors, and dreamers. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFair winds friends."

I now have a office job with benefits. \u00a0As of April 26th,2016, I was able to see a neuro-spinal surgeon and I am now being prepared for cervical spine surgery over the next four weeks. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eStill burns me to know that anyone can be seriously hurt at work and be left to rot.\u00a0I will go around this broken system and get my spinal surgery on my own dime then send workmans comp the bill, with a big middle finger. I would not wish this broken system on my worst enemy. It should be legal to sue this agency for the pain and suffering they cause most people due to purposeful negligence.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo enough of the complaining. I refuse to not live my life to the fullest. This is my second chance at life. I spent half my life living for my profession to serve my community.
