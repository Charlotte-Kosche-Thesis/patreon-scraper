I\u0027m currently run a Minecraft server that is wonderfully active with some of the most amazing people on earth. In addition to that, I play the SIMS (and as many other games as I can find time for) and I share every part of this on \u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/akiss4luck\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eyoutube\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://www.twitch.tv/akiss4luck\" target=\"_blank\"\u003etwitch TV\u003c/a\u003e. That said, it took a lot of persuasion for me to create this Patreon account.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBeing completely open with \"the public\" is not a strength of mine, but here with you, I will take every opportunity to do so. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo many people have supported me, have given hours of their time and hundreds of their dollars just to stay connected with me. They have done this at a time when I had no real way to reward them other than the time I can spend with them via the Net. Maybe Patreon can help me change that. I encourage you to look at the many levels of support and the rewards that go with them and decide for yourself how much you would like to pledge to me monthly. Since many of you are already donating regularly, it seems brilliant that I could find a way to reward you in some special, just-for-you way.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u0027Till next time, remember to live life happy, and build it beautiful.\u003cbr\u003e",
