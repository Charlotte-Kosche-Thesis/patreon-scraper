I also stream somewhat daily. Writing has always taken a backseat to my life and my work.

A minimum of 150 pages, and a maximum of everything I\u0027ve ever wanted to say but didn\u0027t know how to.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you believe in me, in my writing--I hope it\u0027s enough to push you to pledge. And if you can\u0027t afford it, I hope you will still support my work on my twitter or WordPress. Because it\u0027s not about the money. It\u0027s about making you feel. About turning words into emotions, and my stories into cognitive thought.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEverything you read here is the most private of my musings. Nothing will be reposted.\u00a0I hope you let me show you me: in the most intimate way I\u0027ve learned how.\u003cbr\u003e"
