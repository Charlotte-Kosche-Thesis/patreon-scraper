    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s becoming increasingly difficult for me to justify writing on Quora for free.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you know (\u003cem\u003eor should know\u003c/em\u003e) by now, writers on Quora are not paid for their content creation; they contribute to Quora for free. They volunteer their time and energy to share their knowledge and experiences within the internet community, and in return, they learn a little something from other Quorans as well. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor me, my motivation to read and write on Quora was a combination of curiosity, free time, and having a little fun. Part of what made this possible was due to Quora\u0027s unique Conduct Policies and how they enforced them, which ensured content quality on Quora... \u003cem\u003ethat is, until recently.\u003c/em\u003e \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRecently, Quora has made several changes in their site that make it obvious that they no longer prioritise quality over quantity. And over the past year, you can see the evidence of that on Quora. To add to the diminishing quality of content on Quora, many writers whose answers I frequently admire to read have chosen to leave Quora\u2014mostly also due to Quora\u0027s incompetence in ensuring content quality on their site. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, I understand why Quora is doing this; as their site is becoming increasingly popular on the internet, and being used more frequently as a resource on Google searches, Quora wants to be able to continue to grow, and attract more and more advertisers to advertise on Quora. And in order to do that, some of Quora\u0027s more restrictive policies will have to be removed; it\u0027s a sacrifice of quality for advertising revenue. \u003cem\u003eI mean, heck\u2014I\u0027d do the same thing if I was Quora. \u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith that in mind, what motivates me to stay on Quora as of 2018?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s \u003cem\u003eNOT \u003c/em\u003ereading quality content.\u003c/strong\u003e It\u0027s getting tougher and tougher to find quality answers to read, or quality questions to follow.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s \u003cem\u003eNOT \u003c/em\u003ewriting quality content. \u003c/strong\u003eThe influx of stupid questions on Quora is making it really hard to write passionately about what I know. So it\u0027s been reduced down to mostly short and pithy answers.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt\u0027s \u003cem\u003eNOT \u003c/em\u003ethe Quora community. \u003c/strong\u003eAfter all, a lot of my favourite writers have either left Quora or been banned from the site.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIt \u003cem\u003eIS \u003c/em\u003ebecause I have too much free time.\u003c/strong\u003e Really, that\u0027s about it. This is legitimately the \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e thing keeping me on Quora nowadays\u2014the fact that I have too much time to kill.\u00a0\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003eBut as of late, my schedule is getting tighter and tighter; I have less and less free time to waste on a website that doesn\u0027t really do much of anything for me. So my motivation to stay on Quora has been reduced to 0. Understandably, many of my fans will be disappointed if I disappear from Quora.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd so, in a desperate last attempt to search for motivation to continue contributing content on Quora, I\u0027ve decided to start a Patreon page. \u003c/strong\u003eFrom now on, until my previous motivations to stay on Quora return, I would like to be paid for my services delivering my knowledge and my personal experiences to the internet. \u003cbr\u003e"
