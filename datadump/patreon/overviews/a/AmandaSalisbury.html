I grabbed hold of this idea of creating space for life to work, making my new year\u2019s theme Discipline.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI create room when I get up before the kids to write, or when I choose to make art instead of watching a movie. Exercising, eating for nutrition, and sleeping - those make room, too. And it\u2019s interesting that Ms. Woolf mentioned money and a room, because money also creates room (or buys the room). Room to write instead of worry (so much) about rent and student loans and kids with ever-growing needs. Money makes room to breathe, to practice self-care.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nA bit of room is what I need. Writing feels like such a luxury when there are bills to pay. But writing isn\u2019t a luxury. Not really. Not for any of us - writers or readers. Writing is a thing that demands room, both in the act and in the consumption.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis year, I am making room to:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003ePublish the second book in the Xyon Chronicles series\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003ePublish a new serialized novel on \u003ca href=\"http://amandasalisburybooks.com\"\u003eamandasalisburybooks.com\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eIllustrate a middle grade novel\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBegin a new novel project for which the research is ready\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eContinue improving as a writer and artist\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\n\n\n\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(31, 73, 125);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat am I asking?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003eI\u2019m asking for your investment in my writing and art business so that I can increase productivity and creativity.

     "about": "I came to my creative life in a roundabout way. After growing up in rural Oklahoma, my way up and out was education. I took a quick and scholarly (and debt-saddled) route through history, law, and business. After several years practicing law and having babies, I fell into a deep anxiety-filled depression.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eSo I left. And began a long journey back to my true loves - my family, my words, and my art.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTheory: Whatever you risk doing during law school classes is what you should be doing in life.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eI wrote. Nearly every class period. Terrified I\u0027d be called on in the middle of a thought...and forget the thought. There were law students - in my class and others - who wrote sentences in French, who drew architectural designs, and all kinds of creative stuff. A couple of my best law school friends studied law during classes. And before. And after. They were doing law, creatively. The ones like me, we were abandoning the creations of our dreams for a creation of someone else\u2019s dreams.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eIt\u0027s been eight years since the deep well of depression nearly swallowed me whole. Practicing law makes infinitely more sense to my student loan servicers. But I\u0027m nearly forty and if I have to rebuild my life and do hard things, I may as well do it for myself.
