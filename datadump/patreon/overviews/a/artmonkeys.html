    "summary": "Hello, friend. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePull up a seat. Sit by the fire -- a fire that echoes the creative fire I\u0027m about to share with you...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a born storyteller. \u003cstrong\u003eStorytelling burns deep within me.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe fire started early.\u003c/strong\u003e My mom has my first drawings as a 2 year old. It was me and my parents walking and playing together, bean-shaped people with potatoes for hands and feet. I never just drew pictures: I engaged myself, then others, in the stories I lived.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe fire grew in me, fed by the fuel of other stories\u003c/strong\u003e -- stories told thru TV shows, animation, films, novels, historical non-fiction -- but my favorite kindling since a very young boy, the most flexible, most dynamic story media is COMICS. If it was in the newspaper as strips, or on the newsstands as books, I\u0027ve been a fan long before I was given the shot at becoming a comic book professional. One of my most prized possessions as a kid was \"Here Comes Snoopy\". I learned ten-dollar words like \"molecular reconstruction\" from Reed Richards in the Fantastic Four. I learned magic could be shaped like fiery discs, or glowing lines in the air and earth from Doctor Strange. I learned there are worlds upon worlds out there, visible in our mind\u0027s eye.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI learned how that fire starts, and fans, and grows.\u003c/strong\u003e Through every aspect of making stories professionally, I\u0027ve gathered, learned, studied, questioned, theorized, and synthesized storytelling in comics; I drew cartoons for newspapers (won some awards there), illustrated for magazines, created sequential art for comics, drawn storyboards for animation and movies -- and in every aspect, I have learned the unique power of comics.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI learned how to carry that fire to audiences.\u003c/strong\u003e Since 2004, I have been developing stories that will be exclusively comics. All kinds: fiction, autobiographical, sci-fi, fantasy, and yes, even super-hero. Some experimental ones have already been put online at some portals like tapastic and gumroad. But it can be better:\u00a0I\u0027m committing to put all my voice and skill onto the pages for you to read.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI learned the cost of making that fire burn.\u003c/strong\u003e Making a living as an in-demand comic book professional is high-pressure, and rates have fallen since I began, so it fills many more of my available moments daily, leaving me so few moments to develop my stories. The economy of making comics as a letterer and designer require I work on dozens of issues every year. It\u0027s hectic. I want -- no, I NEED to flip the equation, and offer what\u0027s uniquely mine for the world to read. The world doesn\u0027t need another letterer; they need my written and drawn stories. I want to tell the stories only I can bring!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI need to show you that storytelling fire now.\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0I\u0027m inviting you to sit and listen: you can make it possible for me to commit to fewer design and lettering projects each year. I don\u0027t need to be building others\u0027 stories any more. It\u0027s time to stake my own places to share these flames in me.\u00a0As your support grows, I\u0027ll be free to devote longer (and still longer!) blocks of time to CREATE ORIGINAL COMICS STORIES. \u003cem\u003eBonus: you\u0027ll get the behind the scenes and early access looks at how I do this! All my skills as an art teacher will be put into recording and sharing my process making comics. I\u0027ll use all my social media on twitter, facebook, YouTube and Twitch to bring you unique process material about making comics.\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI learned fire is better with company.\u003c/strong\u003e I have many supporters -- friends, artists, writers, publishers -- who will help spread the word. I know we will reach the audiences who appreciate and support the stories only I can bring. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLet\u0027s gather the digital village to sit by the virtual fire. I\u0027ll sit silently, looking into the circle we form.\u003cbr\u003eThe crowd grows hushed, the fire begins to wax and glimmer, and I\u0027ll start...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\"Once Upon A Time -- there was this Boy who could see other Worlds...\"\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e~ Dave"
