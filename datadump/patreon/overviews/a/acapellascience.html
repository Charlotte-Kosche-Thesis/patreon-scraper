All I knew was that I\u0027d thought of something that I thought would be awesome, and it was something that I had the knowledge and skills to do. So I sat down and made it happen.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFive years on that\u0027s still what I\u0027m doing. \u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118,146,60);\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eEach of these videos is an experiment\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e--it\u0027s me learning how to communicate science effectively, how to produce music that sounds harmonious and crisp, and how to use the medium of video to pull it all together. I never really know if anyone other than myself will like my next creation; \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118,146,60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eall I know is that I want it to exist\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e, and I\u0027m willing to work as hard as I have to until it does.

Far from being academic, as a YouTuber how popular your next video is can determine whether you can \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118,146,60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eeat\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e and \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118,146,60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003epay my rent\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e that month. When I can\u0027t support myself with my regular YouTube content, I take contract work composing music, making non-science-related videos, and doing paid performances. That has its merits too, but it takes \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118,146,60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003eweeks out of my life\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e that I\u0027d really rather be putting into these videos. It leads to a lot of frustration with how little material I\u0027m putting out, and shifts me into a mind-set of \"just get something done in the easiest, fastest way possible\", rather than really trying to craft something great.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy hope is that if just a few of you would like to pledge to give a dollar or two every time I put out an A Capella Science video, then slowly \u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(118,146,60);\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(79, 97, 40);\"\u003ethis dynamic can start to change\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/span\u003e. I can spend more time doing what I love--making high quality, innovative and engaging science music videos for you folks--and put out more and better videos than ever before.
