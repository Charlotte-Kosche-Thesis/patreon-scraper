Thank you for taking the time to stop by. Authentic Heroines is shaping up to be something very special, and we\u0027re glad you decided to come along for the journey. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nDebuting with the first book in April 2018, Authentic Heroines is a unique Mutants and Masterminds setting that takes place in a world that evolved in such a way that all of the setting\u0027s iconic \nand most powerful superheroes are women.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd it\u0027s a World of Women Empowered.\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eSecret Origins:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI myself am a long-time \nsuperhero tabletop RPG enthusiast as well, and for as long as I  can \nremember, I\u0027ve been a huge fan of heroic women of all genres, but \nespecially women superheroes in particular. Throughout the past decade \nor so, I\u0027ve had  numerous female friends who were experienced with more \nfantasy-based  RPGs, and they liked comics and superhero movies, but \ndidn\u0027t really know where to begin when it came to superhero RPG systems.\n Being my favorite superhero RPG of all-time, I took the liberty of \nintroducing them to Mutants and Masterminds. And because character \ncreation takes some getting used to in the beginning, I would typically \ndesign two or three characters for them to choose from for their first \nsession, just so they could learn the game with with a pre-made \nsuperheroine. The same followed suit with girlfriends along the way who \nwanted to learn how to play Mutants and Masterminds.\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a result, the teaching sessions commonly ended up being solo\n (one player and a GM)  adventures (some people call it on-on-one). I\u0027ve\n always designed and written my own adventures (as I\u0027ve  been the DM/GM \nfar, far more than I\u0027ve ever been a player), so I found  myself \ndesigning a lot of superheroine solo adventures along the way. And I\u0027ve \nlong had the desire to do something very similar to that, though on a \nmuch grander, more daring scale...\n\t\t\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the past couple years, the idea fermented and developed \nuntil it took shape as Authentic Heroines: a  unique setting revealed \nthrough a series of superhero supplements and sourcebooks for Mutants \nand Masterminds - primarily designed with female gamers in mind - that \nguys could also enjoy.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eAnd Now, we Present...\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe World\u0027s Mightiest Heroines!\u003c/strong\u003e\n\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eAuthentic Heroines: The Guide To Solar Woman\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\n\t\u003ca href=\"https://s26.postimg.org/n4gw6bzux/AH1001-_Front-_Cover-_Site-sm.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://s26.postimg.org/n4gw6bzux/AH1001-_Front-_Cover-_Site-sm.jpg\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\t\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAuthentic Heroines: The Guide to Solar Woman\u003c/em\u003e brings new characters and settings to the Third Edition of the World\u0027s Greatest Superhero RPG, \u003cem\u003eMutants and Masterminds\u003c/em\u003e!\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis book introduces \u003cstrong\u003eSolar Woman\u003c/strong\u003e, the most powerful heroine in the Authentic Universe, as well as full details and character write-ups for her allies, supporting cast, and enemies, along with the complete and fully-comprehensive setting of Empire City, as well as several adventures primarily designed for one player and a GM. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWithin these pages, you will discover:\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe Secret Origin of Solar Woman, a heroine known to the world fifteen years earlier as \"The Girl Who Disappeared on her Birthday,\" inexplicably returning a year later with immense power, but no recollection of the events.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe History of the Authentic Universe, a guide to the unique superhero setting that evolved in such a way that all the iconic and most powerful superheroes are women.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eThe Player\u0027s Guide to Empire City, which provides Mutants and Masterminds players and game masters with everything they need to know about the city and its history, geography, prominent locations, and notable inhabitants, including full-color maps of the city and its surrounding areas.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eFour complete adventures specifically designed for Solar Woman, with additional rules and guidelines for including other heroines and players in the adventures, and featuring fearsome villains such as The Mechalith, a sentient mechanical armor that controls its host, instead of the other way around, Princess Darcovia, daughter of a tyrannical alien empress, who has sworn to destroy Solar Woman at all costs due to \"crimes\" against her empire and family... and more!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eBeyond Empire City, an introduction to Rivlunn, an alien world that considers Solar Woman its savior after she drove away the cosmic-level threat of Kor\u0027Dhum the Ravager, and includes full details and information regarding Kor\u0027Dhum itself.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\t\u003cli\u003eAdditional and fully playable allies to team-up with Solar Woman, including \u003cstrong\u003eAditi\u003c/strong\u003e, the immortal goddess of the skies!\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/em\u003eNote: The PDF version also includes Hero Lab files for every character in the book.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u2022 Format: Full-color, 64 pages\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 ISBN-10: 0-9993960-7-2\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u2022 ISBN-13: 978-0999396070\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ch4 style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAuthentic Heroines: A World of Women Empowered!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cem\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAuthentic Adventures:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/em\u003eWe have up to three supplements scheduled for release in 2018, with several smaller surprises in store.\u003cem\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eEach major supplement in Authentic Heroines will focus on one of the setting\u0027s most important superheroines, with complete details of her origins and background so that she is a well-rounded, three-dimensional character, and will also include her in-game stats, of course. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAdditionally, each book will provide full details regarding the heroine\u0027s supporting cast and the city she lives in. Supporting cast will include personal relationships such as her family, friends, co-workers, etc. that she knows well and commonly interacts with. Her city will be comprehensively detailed with full-color, beautifully rendered maps that denote landmarks for important locales within the city, complete with write-ups for each location, as well as notable inhabitants for these locations, giving it the feel of a living, breathing city. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFurthermore, the book will include four (4) full-length adventures specifically designed for that heroine, with four or more villains for those adventures. These aren\u0027t just random villains that have no connection to the heroine - they form the core of the heroine\u0027s \"rogue\u0027s gallery,\" and their history with her is well documented, but easily modified as desired. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFinally, each book will include two additional heroic and capable allies for the heroine, who also live in the same city. This allows the GM to include other players in the adventures, or even use them as heroic NPCs. Each adventure in the book is also designed with intricate guidelines for how to change mechanical elements to include additional players - there\u0027s no guesswork for the GM (building encounters in Mutants and Masterminds is one of my strong suites).\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nIn essence, each book is a complete mini-setting focusing on one major heroine (and two powerful allies), with 4 adventures for 1-3 players and a GM.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nTeach someone how to play Mutants and Masterminds, use it as a starting point for your own campaign, drop the city and characters into your already existing campaign, or play the continuing adventures of the Authentic Heroines as written...the options are limitless.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd for you all-female gaming groups out there, yes, there will be group/team-based books that assemble the Authentic Heroines for even greater adventures.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nThis is merely the beginning...\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWhy Patreon?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFirst of all, we had a few people ask about it, and didn\u0027t figure it would hurt anything.
