School loan payments are heavy. I learned a lot between starting school, graduation and getting my first industry job, as well as getting into my current job. I like to offer as much help and insight as I can on my tumblr, to help those learn from my mistakes and experiences. I love to answer any questions I can that I receive over at my tumblr, too. I like to offer that help and insight as I can for free on my tumblr, and this Patreon is a little thank-you-tip-jar to help with the costs of school and other expenses that I\u0027m working to pay down. As a way of thanks, patrons will get access to extra sketches and things I might not normally post on my tumblr. Since I am currently working full time, and have a second job as well, I will do my best to entertain and enlighten my patrons :)\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you kindly for your support!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYou can follow me online at:\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://aronjshay.tumblr.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTumblr\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://twitter.com/arondraws\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eTwitter\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://Facebook.com/AronDraws\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFacebook\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://arondraws.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eMy Portfolio\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
