     "about": "I am an example of an\nindividual whose life was changed completely by my national service as a US\nPeace Corps Volunteer. I left for my assignment in Guatemala in 2002; carrying\nwith me a lifetime spent studying ecology, animal and life/ earth sciences, humanities,\nand literature; as well as several years of professional experience in\nagriculture, environmental education, and biomedical research. In Guatemala, I\nworked as a field veterinarian living at almost 11,000\u2019 above sea level-\ntreating everything from vampire bat bites and tropical parasite infestations\nto human malnutrition- and literally rode a horse to get to work most days. I\nalso was asked to be an advisor and geneticist on a large sheep breeding\nprogram. My work brought me in contact with local people\u2019s stories about how\nthe weather was \u201cgoing crazy\u201d and affecting all aspects of their life. My\nbackground in climate change led to guess- correctly- that tropical mountain\ncommunities were being affected more rapidly by climate change than most of the\nrest of the world. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nGuatemala is a very unequal\ncountry- on the internationally recognized GINI inequality index, it often\nranks in the top 3 spots. The capital is an example of an economically diverse,\ngrowing economy, similar in human wellbeing indices to places like Mumbai- with\nlots of problems, but also with the growing resources to resolve them and move\naway from poverty. Meanwhile, 8 hours away, the communities I worked in have\nhuman well-being indices equal to many regions of sub-Saharan Africa. I learned\nthat the reliance in national averages tends to make human and environmental\nrights issues thus literally disappear from sight when we make decisions where\nassistance from the developed world is needed to help people create\nself-determination in their own lives. Listening to people\u2019s stories, and\nhaving the rare privilege denied to many foreigners of being invited into\nhomes, lives, medical stories, and worship centers of marginalized people gave\nme a unique perspective on the interconnectedness of our lives. I left my Peace\nCorps assignment to return to work in the United States, but maintained\npresence in my work in the sheep economic development project we started, made\nseveral visits back to Guatemala, and decided to start figuring out how best to\ndedicate my life to climate change adaptation and resilience in the Guatemalan\nhighlands. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn-between, I returned to\nwork as a research technician in flu and tuberculoisis, working under biosafety\nlevel three conditions. I went to a large biomedical technology company, where\nI first managed our genetic and health testing and record-keeping program for\nover 3 million animals (over 2000 varieties of genetically engineered rats and\nmice), and then was quickly promoted to be our corporate animal welfare and\nethics committee chair. I was one of the youngest persons in the United States\nto ever chair this committee, and one of the very few to ever do so with \u201conly\u201d\na Bachelor\u2019s degree. I also received 18 months of intense management\ndevelopment training, where I did a research project on selection, management,\nand retention of highly talented and motivated employees- with recommendations\nfor policy and culture changes. In 2009, I made the decision to accept a\nprofessional offer in academia, where I could concurrently work and pursue a\nmaster\u2019s degree. I quickly enrolled in a PT and later FT program in\nagricultural resource economics, which permitted me the flexibility to design\nmy own study in climate change impact in Latin America. I worked for UCONN as\nan ethics program coordinator and vice-president of the ethics committee, and\nthen as sustainability coordinator, while I pursued my coursework. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn 2011, I returned to Guatemala\nto plan my own non-governmental organization and my extensive field research. I\nmoved there more or less permanently in 2012. I have been working to re-define\nmyself as a climate change specialist, and speak often of the need to treat\nclimate change as a complex socio-economic problem, with attainable\nsocio-economic choices, adaptations, and decisions. In this capacity, I have\nworked professionally as a community climate change and water specialist for 30\nmunicipalities in 5 departments. I worked 6 months as a volunteer for the\nenvironmental and protected area department of another municipality. I worked\nfor USAID as a regional coordinator for integrated development indices across\n2000 projects and programs. When I was not working for USAID, I designed and\noffered a series of 4 professional-level courses in climate change adaptation,\nand was invited as an expert advisor for several national level events, policy\nand law review and drafting, think tanks, and project and program design. In\n2013, my partner and I actually drafted a proposed stance for Guatemala to\npresent at the international conference on climate change. The stance we\ndrafted was an appeal to the responsibility of developed nations towards\nless-developed regions of the world, in the face of lack of unified action\nworldwide to curb emissions. \u003cbr\u003e\n\nIn addition to my paid and\nunpaid scientific and economic advisory and direction and teaching work, I have\nused my time there to self-publish three poetry books, paint a mural based on\nGuatemala\u2019s sacred Popul vuh text, collect thousands of stories and photos,\nform a promotional community arts network, and work cultural references into my\njewelry designs for my other small business.  I am currently finishing three publications\nfor my master\u2019s thesis, leading my NGO through our final stages of\nlegalization, and soliciting paid consulting, teaching, translating, and\ndevelopment project opportunities. I have had my Spanish ability tested, and I\nrank as high-level professional fluency in both written and spoken settings. I\nam trying to avoid a formal \u201cjob\u201d structure right now, in order to have the\nprofessional flexibility to focus on using my voice in writing and art for\ngenerating more impact in the complex world of climate change, evidence-based\nsolutions, and generating the compassion and empathy we will need to address\nthe enormous challenges we see in front of us. \u003cbr\u003e",
