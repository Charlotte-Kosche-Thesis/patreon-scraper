    "summary": "My interest in the tapestry of politics and media began in the 90\u2019s when I stumbled into a table of zines at a punk show at the Fireside Bowl. Since then, I\u0027ve written and photographed for numerous publications, zines, books and websites. I was a regular contributor to \u003ca href=\"http://chicagoist.com/author/aaroncynic\"\u003eChicagoist \u003c/a\u003eand Gothamist for 8 years, and my work has also appeared in Progress Illinois, Alternet, Truthout, \u003ca href=\"http://visu.news/\"\u003eVisu.News\u003c/a\u003e, In These Times, The Daily Line, The Huffington Post, Shareable and more.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOver the years I\u0027ve covered Chicago and Illinois politics inside and out, chronicled movements and the work activists have done to change the world around them, and major events like the \u003ca href=\"http://aaroncynic.net/index.php/2016/10/10/2016-rnc/\"\u003eRepublican\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"http://aaroncynic.net/index.php/2016/10/10/2016-dnc/\"\u003eDemocratic \u003c/a\u003enational conventions.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy passion is independent media: me with cameras and a laptop traveling around and talking to folks, experiencing events firsthand, trying to find untold or underreported stories, and finding the angle that highlights the perspectives of marginalized peoples. In the years I\u2019ve been writing, shooting photos and video and reporting I\u2019ve survived without the financial backing of a corporate newsroom - buying and maintaining my own equipment, making way to where a story is breaking, and working double time juggling several projects. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eConsider this my contract with you: you help me survive and I will keep you up-to-date on stories large and small that need to be told. Every little bit helps and goes to everything from maintaining gear to traveling to grabbing a coffee and some wifi to upload. Now more than ever, media needs to speak truth to power and journalists need every resource available to hold the powerful accountable. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eVisit \u003ca href=\"http://aaroncynic.net/\"\u003eaaroncynic.net\u003c/a\u003e to see some of my previous work, and keep your eyes open at \u003ca href=\"http://visu.news/\"\u003eVisu.News\u003c/a\u003e and other places for more."
