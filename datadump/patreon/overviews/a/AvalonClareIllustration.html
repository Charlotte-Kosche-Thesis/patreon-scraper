    "summary": "Hi there! My name is \u003cstrong\u003eAvalon Clare\u003c/strong\u003e and I\u0027m a digital illustrator. Originally from Colorado, I got my BFA in Illustration from UArts in Philadelphia back in 2008. I\u0027m currently working as a freelance illustrator from my home in Puerto Rico, where I have lived since January of 2017. I also have an Etsy store where I sell stickers, buttons, prints, and original drawings. I super duper \u003cstrong\u003eLOVE\u003c/strong\u003e to draw, and I especially love drawing \u003cstrong\u003eportraits\u003c/strong\u003e. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve joined Patreon because there is \u003cstrong\u003eso much more\u003c/strong\u003e that I want to draw, but I can\u0027t justify doing it without making money. That\u0027s where you come in! Your support allows me to draw things that are \u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003epersonally meaningful \u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003eto me instead of being limited by the world of freelance. It also gives people an opportunity to stay up to date with my life, both as a\u003cstrong\u003e creative person\u003c/strong\u003e and as someone who was living in Puerto Rico for both Hurricanes Irma and Maria (an experience that changed my life forever). With your support, I can do portraits and interviews with Puerto Ricans detailing their experience on the island. I can start my long awaited series of portraits and interviews of non-binary folks. These are just a couple of ideas, but the possibilities are endless. Essentially, with Patreon I can take \u003cstrong\u003epersonal projects\u003c/strong\u003e that have long wasted away on the back burner of my art stove and cook them into something \u003cstrong\u003eREAL!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Your pledges will also help me buy \u003cem\u003eactual\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0food,\u00a0pay my bills, purchase art supplies, pay rent, support local businesses on the island, and most importantly, to do the kind of creative work that \u003cstrong\u003enourishes my soul\u003c/strong\u003e. Who knows, maybe it will nourish yours too.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIf you choose to support my campaign, it\u0027s\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eentirely up to you\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0how much you pledge. Even \u003cstrong\u003e$1 \u003c/strong\u003ea month makes a difference! Each pledge level comes with different \u003cstrong\u003erewards\u003c/strong\u003e such as\u00a0blog updates, views into my sketchbook, a deeper look into my process as a digital artist, and \u003cstrong\u003emore!\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Not everyone wants (or is able) to buy an original drawing or commission a unique portrait. Patreon offers a \u003cstrong\u003eflexible\u003c/strong\u003e and \u003cstrong\u003eeasy to use\u003c/strong\u003e platform, especially for people who love art and want to support creatives but aren\u0027t sure how. \u00a0And don\u0027t worry, you can edit or cancel your pledge at any time.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI have never had the means to focus on art as much as I would like to, but with Patreon I\u0027m hopeful that this change is within my reach at last. When people support me creatively, grateful simply isn\u0027t a big enough word for the feeling it gives me.\u00a0\u003cstrong\u003eThank you \u003c/strong\u003efor being a part of my dreams!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
