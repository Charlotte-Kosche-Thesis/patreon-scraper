First, I want to thank you for taking the time to visit my page. I\u0027m so happy to have you here and would like to tell you a little bit about myself. I am a cosplay model from Atlanta, Georgia and have been a model for about six years. I am also a cosplayer with Asperger Syndrome, I try to bring awareness where ever I go and I also try to encourage other people to follow their dreams as well. One of my biggest goals is to inspire others.\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n \u00a0With your support, I\u0027ll be able to get more photo shoots done, You\u0027ll be able to see me do more cosplays, I\u0027ll be able to get more content for my social media platforms (Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook), I will create exclusive content for Patreon only eyes, and I\u0027ll be able to travel more to conventions out of state. \u00a0I also will be able to schedule more photoshoots for my cosplay lingerie and bikini shoots as well as collaborated shoots with other cosplay models.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI am a cosplayer that cosplays mostly from anime and video games, I sometimes branch out and cosplay a bit from comic books. If you stick with me you can expect to see that I am a nerdy girl but I\u0027m very passionate about cosplay and modeling. I try to bring the characters to life in every picture. I also have a passion and love for the art of Photography so you might even see some of my own pictures I take from time to time of other cosplayers. Because of this, you\u0027ll also see I model for a wide range of photographers from professional to amateur because I am a firm believer that everyone starts somewhere. \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nAnd now on to talk about some of my accomplishments, if you want to skip this part I understand. I have been a cosplay guest in Kentucky, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi. I have hosted and Judged several cosplay contests, I frequently host panels at conventions about cosplaying on a budget and Cosplaying with Disabilities. I have been published twice in a international magazine called \"Phantasm\".\u00a0 In 2017 I won a Best in Show at a convention for my sewing and prop making skills.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/19601197_1790185887664777_3347505355180981571_n.jpg?oh=becbbd1a9c12d98269243445262e36fe\u0026amp;oe=5AE9C35E\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat to Expect \u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nRewards\n will be fulfilled by the 15th of each month if your payment was \nprocessed. If there is a delay because of me attending a convention or \nevent, I will be sure to let everyone know. I often travel to a \nconvention once to three times a month so some months, my schedule can \nbe a little insane. But I will keep you all informed and I thank you in \nadvance for your patience. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nI do cosplay videos to show off my \ncostumes. I do cosplay \"selfie\" photosets that I will normally charge \n$20 to $35 dollars for a set. But if your a loyal pledge to the $20 dollar tier\n or more; you\u0027ll get full downloads of any selfie sets I come out with \nand charge for. I do cannon cosplay, sexy cosplay, pin up cosplay, \ncoskini, and cosplay boudoir. I am also a dork, so you can expect some \ndorky videos to go along with the sexy cosplay videos. I will also post \nup how to posts about how I make certain things for cosplay. The monthly picture download under the $5 tier and up is always a surprise. It could be from a professional photoshoot, or a really nice full selfie and could be boudoir, cosplay swimsuit, or full cosplay. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nWhen I am working on a cosplay costume, you\u0027ll get updates on that costume, progress photos and cosplay tips. If I order a cosplay, you get updates on that as well. And see me try on new cosplays here. I also like do sexy dance videos when I do cosplay tests or selfie photosets. So you\u0027ll get to see those exclusively here on Patreon. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI also like to try to get to know and keep in contact with all my Patreons to the best of my ability. So if you want to message me and say hello, feel free. Never feel like your bothering me. If I am busy, I\u0027ll just answer you later. To me, you guys are more then just a pledge, your a supporter and a supporter that is going above and beyond. I am extremely grateful for all the support I get through Patreon. Every little bit helps me in so many ways.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003ciframe allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-7pIv4fo3M\" width=\"560\"\u003e\u003c/iframe\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color: rgb(128, 100, 162);\"\u003eWhat I hope to Achieve\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nI would like to be able to do a photoshoot once a month in cosplay. I would like for you all to have fresh new images to see every month. If I make enough, I will also do a boudoir / bikini photoshoot each month as well. I would like to be able to travel a bit more and get the chance to work even more of a variety of photographers. I wanna spread the word about my experiences with doing all this while struggling with Autism, share my story to encourage others to follow there own dreams and to never give up. \u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nMy ultimate goal, I would like love to be able to travel to bigger conventions and travel further so that I have will have the chance to meet some of my followers in places like but not limited to California, New York, and even Canada but I am sure I have a long way to go to achieve this.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent.fatl1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/25443269_1978797352136962_4682261481887087256_n.jpg?oh=bebcd6de82d3db89e5d2e61ca7f764b8\u0026amp;oe=5AE94C2E\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"
