Using classic movies, books and TV shows as a template, we create full length puppet parodies on stage (kinda like \u003cem\u003eForgetting Sarah Marshall\u003c/em\u003e). \u003cem\u003eHamlet Has No Leg\u003c/em\u003es,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eFifty Shades of Felt\u003c/em\u003e, \u003cem\u003eJurassic Puppets, Top Gun: Live, Abridged\u00a0and Completely Underfunded, \u003c/em\u003e\u003cem\u003eand Alien: A Puppet Show \u003c/em\u003eare just a few of the shows that have been fisted by us.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHAT DO WE NEED?\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003c/strong\u003eUnlike most theaters, we need to build every character that walks on our stage. New characters are almost always required when doing new shows like \u003cem\u003eTop Gun (\u003c/em\u003eTom Cruise puppet) or in our newest Christmas offering,\u00a0\u003cem\u003eDie Hard\u003c/em\u003e (Bruce Willis). We have tried our best to give audiences something new in every show, but to keep costs low, we sometimes have to skip out on new puppets.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the last seven years we have always been able to support ourselves. We\u0027ve always been able to support ourselves and have never lost money on a show in seven years. Our hope is not to bring the status quo, but to bring something special to each production. Our goal is not just new puppets, but better special effects, lighting, sets, props and an expansion of our overall quality.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY A MONTHLY FEE?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\nFor the price of a cup of coffee, we can bring you a sustainable theater. There is no denying theater as an art form doesn\u0027t see a lot of money roll in. The good news? Getting rich is not something we are interested in. If it was, we would have changed our major in college. If we can get enough people to slap down a five spot (or more!) every month, we can keep doing what we love, for the people we love, and those people can watch us loving them. Clear?\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eWHY SHOULD YOU SUPPORT US?\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0Before Pixar and\n3D there were puppets! Puppets everywhere! Now, it is a dying art form. It is\ntime to go back to your 80\u2019s roots when all of your favorite characters had a\nfoam head and a hand up their butt.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003eSupport\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0a worthy group who is trying to get video game\nidle brains interested in theater again. \n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSupport\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0a group who doesn\u2019t think the Muppets should be\nthe only ones doing what they do.\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSupport\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0us because you would be making our dreams come\ntrue and, selfishly, that will make you feel good!\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cstrong\u003e\nSupport\u003c/strong\u003e us because if you don\u2019t, our puppets will\npersonally haunt your children and their children\u2019s children\u2026 Just kidding\u2026 Or\nare we?\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e"

The company has garnered numerous awards and recognitions for their productions and live events.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAll Puppet Players shows are for mature audiences with exceedingly immature tastes (although tasting is not recommended due to risk of fur balls).
