    "summary": "When it comes to art, I create for the community. I come from a place where things are difficult, but don\u0027t we all. The real point is what we do to build a better situation for ourselves as well as our peers. Utilizing music as my medium I speak on social, political, economic, spiritual, and philosophical topics. As I say we all go through it, but using art applied progressively we can get through all of it. I also started an organization called \u003ca href=\"http://theoaklandmind.com\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Oakland Mind\u003c/a\u003e. We came together to bring this art and music into the next level. And push the envelope, setting the bar so high that artists start focusing on real issues and the community again. I\u0027m creating this campaign because I\u0027ve been having a hard time balancing work-life-community- and music. I don\u0027t ask for much, but just a little bit goes a long away. If I could get help with the basic necessities in life I can focus my full attention creating art that influences a generation. As well as a platform for other artists to promote themselves and raise our collective consciousness.\u003cbr\u003e"
