    "summary": "Hi, I\u0027m Jeremy. Thanks for viewing my page. I hope you join me on my journey.\u00a0 I\u0027ve been obsessively studying fascinating topics that would make a big difference in the world if everyone knew what I have uncovered. Unfortunately, too few have the time to dedicate their lives to it like I do. And the system is designed to obscure this information so that only a few will find it. So I believe spreading these ideas is one of the most important things we can do to make the world a better place. Luckily, I can share in minutes what it takes me so much time to learn!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho I Am \u0026amp; What I Do\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI study topics that are necessary in order to make the world a better place. I see so much potential in this broken world. I believe we\u0027re living in the most important time in human history. A time when we decide the fate of humanity. The importance of where we go, collectively, from here cannot be overstated. Therefore I learn from the greatest minds and anything else I can get my hands on so that we can make a positive difference in the world.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eComing from a low income/middle-class family, I hated reading until I discovered the book The Cashflow Quadrant. It inspired me to start reading other books about personal finance so that I would one day be wealthy and financially free, which are two different things. I didn\u0027t want to raise my kids financially restrained. I took full charge searching for the best books and diving into them to feed my brain. That led me to reading personal development books such as \u003cem\u003eThink And Grow Rich\u003c/em\u003e and \u003cem\u003eHow To Win Friends And Influence People\u003c/em\u003e. Personal development eventually led me to learning about natural health, which I\u0027m very passionate about! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy aim is to provide a unique angle that connects all of these seemingly unrelated topics, and others, together in a way that hasn\u0027t been done before. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy Journey So Far\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAbout 8 years ago I decided to work on this mission full time. I spent years researching and writing relentlessly. I have an inquisitive mind and seek the truth. I feel it\u0027s my calling to share what I\u0027ve learned along the way. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo far I\u0027ve only published 1 ebook - Gifts From Nature. But I\u0027ve got several others already written, along with a book that I will print - The Awareness Revolution. Though I already have so much content written, it\u0027s taking me an enormous amount of time to do everything myself! Though I haven\u0027t had a good source of income, I\u0027ve learned a lot of useful things to help in my business, such as:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cul\u003e\u003cli\u003eHow to design websites on Wordpress\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eVideo production\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eBlogging\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eSEO basics\u003c/li\u003e\u003c/ul\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been blogging and creating Youtube videos to share my message with the world. Now that I have a grip on things I\u0027m so excited to share my content with the world! Only it feels like I\u0027m crawling along being a 1 man band trying to do it all. It has been frustrating, and the sacrifice I\u0027ve made so far is immeasurable. But the passion I have for seeking truth and figuring things out, coupled with how important this information is to humanity, fuels me to keep moving forward every single day. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere We\u0027re Going\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy next step is to launch a podcast. I\u0027ve already recorded a few episodes but because I\u0027m recording video podcasts it takes me much longer. I will be launching it any day now. I would love to produce a lot more content than I am now. Besides having several books already written and waiting to be published, I also have over 100 blog post drafts that I would love to finish and share. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter publishing my books I plan to produce a documentary and a docu-series. The documentary will be more entertaining to watch, but the docu-series will dig much deeper into the topics discussed. I\u0027ve already got most of the equipment and most of the pre-production is done because it will be based on my upcoming book - The Awareness Revolution.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter the documentary I would love to produce music with a positive message. There\u0027s so much negative music out there either without a message or with a trashy message. I want to change that. I even a little bit of a music background, plus having the video production tools will really help promote the music too.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow You Can Join Me\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter years of hard work I\u0027ve concluded I can\u0027t do this on my own. The world needs my help and I need help too. I don\u0027t want any random corporate sponsors. I won\u0027t advertise or promote anything I don\u0027t believe in. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e Join The Awareness Revolution by becoming a patron and we\u0027ll grow this movement together. I\u0027ll include you in as much or as little as you want. You can guide me on the content you feel needs to be produced the most, give me constructive criticism, and even help me think of good rewards for all you patrons. I\u0027ll show my appreciation in any way I can and in a way that benefits you the most.\u003cbr\u003e"
