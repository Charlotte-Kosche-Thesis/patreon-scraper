    "summary": "Amy Castle is an award-winning actress, lifestyle host, fitness motivator, and human being.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGarnering success since the age of eight, she grew up in the television world, sharing the screen with the likes of Bryan Cranston, Jim Belushi, Jerry O\u2019Connell, Calista Flockhart, Hilary Duff and more. She has recurred on \u201cAlly McBeal,\u201d \u201cGeneral Hospital,\u201d and \u201cPassions,\u201d and guest starred on \u201cMalcolm in The Middle,\u201d \u201cLizzie McGuire,\u201d and \u201cThe Defenders,\u201d to name a few.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe also recurred in 13 episodes of the the Rainn Wilson produced series \u201cImpress Me\u201d on the POP TV Network and has been featured on \u201cFunny or Die.\u201d\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt was at the young age of three that Amy received her first taste of the spotlight. Born into a musically artistic family, her mother was inspired to write a children\u2019s album for her, which her father recorded. Of the eleven tracks on the album, three year old Amy sang one herself \u2013 a 43 second recording that has now exploded into the viral phenomenon known as \u201cThe Cuppycake Song.\u201d The album was uploaded to the internet in 1996, and to date, the song has been played over 200 million times on YouTube alone. Amy has been interviewed by Inside Edition, and Tyra Banks, among others. It\u2019s a long story. Just google it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eGrowing up in a healthy household with a personal trainer mother, Amy was immersed in the world of natural products from day one. Raised on organic, wheat and dairy free foods, she learned at an early age that what you put into your body reflects how you feel, and how you live your life. As she got older, she was finding herself leisurely browsing grocery store aisles and fascinated by nutrition labels. Always on the hunt for something good for you as well as your taste buds. At the same time, she was becoming the go-to girl in her friend circle for the lo-down on restaurants in the LA area, as well as what to make at home. Amy quickly realized that she could combine her talents in front of the camera with her passion for healthy eating, and voila! \u201cWhat\u2019s Amy Eating?\u201d popped out of the mental oven.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eShe has over 35,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel and her videos have been viewed over 4 million times.\u003cbr\u003e"
