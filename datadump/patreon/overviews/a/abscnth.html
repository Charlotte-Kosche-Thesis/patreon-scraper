     "about": "Like most of us inspired by the idea of imaginative realms, Lord Of The Rings played a crucial part of my early childhood... The idea of a world inhabited by dragons and fairies, where heroes rose and dark lords reigned was captivating. I don\u0027t recall what my first introduction to magical worlds was, though I do hold a memory of loving the book James and the Giant Peach by Roald Dahl. But the spectacle that was Wizard of Oz has always held a very special place in my heart... When I look back now I think that it was my first true belief that all great things involved a journey into the unknown. That journey began at a young age armed with a crayon, later pencils... and then paints!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHowever, frustrated with my attempts at traditional art in my younger years I truly embraced the magic that seemed to happen before me at the advent of the digital age. A technology that moved with such pace and gave such immediacy in its results I was captivated for many years...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI had for so much of my life remained exclusively inspired by fantasy art to the exclusion of everything else... That was until I opened a gallery in Stourbridge. Now I was introduced to all forms of art in all subject media, I was truly inspired by the interpretations and by all of the mediums used to capture those visions.\u003cbr\u003eThis for me was the rainbow... It was the education and the inspiration to try so many new ideas. I was hooked on working with traditional mediums as I had used when I was younger, and as I mastered them so I was moved to educate those around me!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMy early years of drawing the fairy tales that I loved had been abandoned long ago in the mists of my past, replaced by epic fantasy the like of which the Lord of The Rings films were now bringing to a greater audience. I decided that the time was right to travel to unknown lands (more commonly known as the USA) armed now with a greater technical skill than I had ever before known.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut the journey led in unexpected directions, here at Illuxcon I met the legends of my childhood, saw the industry that I had always craved to be a part of, and though I loved it still I left feeling that it wasn\u0027t where I wanted to be right then... The last two years have truly been the most decisive and yet the most tumultuous of my artistic journey, where would I go with my art now? In the tradition of good old fairy tales, help and guidance came from the unexpected around me, from the support and wise words of friends.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA wise woman met upon this path said to me... \"Don\u0027t jump into the chasm and expect a net to appear... Why not jump and expect to reach the other side!\" I pondered her words quite deeply and realised that, again, like in the fairy tales, we can always succeed if we allow ourselves to believe. For too long I have painted with my head, wondering what might work, this project \"World War Fae\" is painted with my soul, it is full of my hopes, desires, fears. It will represent a long look at what is important in my life, just as Dorothy and her companions do upon the yellow brick road... After all, the greatest gift the fairy tale gives us... Is hope!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
