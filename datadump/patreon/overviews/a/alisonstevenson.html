    "summary": "Hey! I\u0027m Alison. I\u0027m a comedian and writer who has been fortunate enough to receive some popularity with my articles over the years. Right now, I\u0027m broke. I\u0027m trying to create quality content without the restrictions that come from publishing for larger companies. I want to write more, and write the things that I want to write. Things that I personally feel are more entertaining for the general public.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA little more about me and my history: My breakout article is without a doubt, \u201cWhy I Don\u2019t Give Blowjobs\u201d (VICE). This piece went viral in a matter of hours, and sparked a national conversation about unfairness in oral sex between men and women in heterosexual couples. I still get hate mail for it! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSince then, I got louder. Much of my work mixes the personal with the sociological. I love dissecting human behavior, calling out bullshit, and I always try to be funny in the process. Other articles I\u0027ve written include analyzing the modern state of casual sex, looking into what it means to be body positive and practicing self-love, musings on online dating, and even conducting experiments like having a therapist listen to me on a first date.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOutside of VICE, I\u0027ve also written for Teen Vogue, Glamour, xoJane, Filmdrunk, Munchies, Broadly, and The Establishment. As a stand-up comedian, I\u0027ve performed all over the country at renowned venues and festivals. I made my debut television appearance on season 1 of Viceland\u2019s stand-up television series, \u201cFlop House\u201d. I also made some notable podcast appearances, including being a featured guest on Dan Savage\u0027s \"Lovecast\". My comedy has been featured on Paste, Playboy, Grantland, Splitsider, Huffington Post, and Jezebel.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been working hard, but there\u0027s still so much more I want to accomplish. What I\u2019ve experienced over these past two years is an outpour of both intense love and intense vitriol for speaking my truth. I have become inundated with emails and private messages from both women and men thanking me for what I\u2019ve had to say. Women from all over the world have told me that I have helped change their romantic lives for the better. This kind of support is what keeps me going.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBasically, I want to do more with my writing and my comedy, more on my terms. I\u0027m hoping with the support of my followers I can continue working as a writer and not give up on the dream just yet. It\u0027s the fans who have been so supportive over the years that have kept me going, and I am forever grateful for such support.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eLinks to some of my work:\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*My album on Spotify\u00a0\u003ca href=\"https://open.spotify.com/album/6eO3w81pQhQZ3p3WC1AUvG\"\u003ehttps://open.spotify.com/album/6eO3w81pQhQZ3p3WC1A...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Video of my stand up featured on WhoHaHa \u003cbr\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://whohaha.com/alison-stevenson-much-woman/\"\u003ehttp://whohaha.com/alison-stevenson-much-woman/\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*My recent short that I wrote and starred in, \u201cThirty-Six\u201d: \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/229354454\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/229354454\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Blessed\u2019s Youtube Page: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/blessedcomedy\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/user/blessedcomedy\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*Sketches I wrote, directed, and acted in for my art show: \u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cBreaking News: The Bedside Strangler\u201d \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/180471312\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/180471312\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cQuestion Time with Ms. Minge\u201d \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/180398214\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/180398214\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u201cThe Titan Tongue Infomercial\u201d \u003ca href=\"https://vimeo.com/180425995\"\u003ehttps://vimeo.com/180425995\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e*VICE author page: \u003ca href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/contributor/alison-stevenson\"\u003ehttps://www.vice.com/en_us/contributor/alison-ste...\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
