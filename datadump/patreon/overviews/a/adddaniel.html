    "summary": "Hey guys! Thanks so much for stopping by and considering teaming up with the channel!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs you may or may not know, there are costs associated with generating delicious content here on the internets! From exorbitant ISP costs associated with faster upload speeds, to new equipment upgrades, to putting diapers on little butts and food in little mouths, there is a lot of time, energy, and finance needed to make the highest quality, best content around! And I want to make even more, even better content! \u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe ALL contribute in one way or another. For most of us, our contribution is simply watching the videos our favorite content creators put out. For most of us that is the extent of what we can afford to do, and (hear me when I say) I am SO appreciative of every single view I get. I\u0027m so glad that you guys enjoy the content that I make and I want to keep EVERYTHING that we do on AfterActs TV 100% free, for as long as we\u0027re putting out content.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhat I WOULD like to do is\u00a0humbly invite you to partner with me if you value the content that I put out and have some disposable income. That\u0027s pretty much what this page is, simply put: This Patreon page exists to give you the ability to partner up with AfterActs TV financially on a monthly basis. The more money we can bring in, the more content we can make for EVERYONE. So Thank you in advance for your consideration.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA NOTE ON THE REWARDS STRUCTURE:\u003cbr\u003eYou\u0027ll notice that this Patreon page is structured a bit differently than some other pages you may have visited in that, regardless of the amount that you pledge, you will receive all of the stuffs and the things. That\u0027s right, whether you pledge 1 dollar a month or 1000 dollars a month, you will receive all of the rewards that I have to offer. I know what it is like to be super tight on money, and it is very important to me that everyone is able to access all of the content that I create and not feel pressured to contribute more money than they can easily afford! I am not a business and I do not want to operate as a business, I am simply a content creator. One of the biggest joys that I have is being able to provide all of the content on the channel at no charge and with no obligation of any sort, so I couldn\u0027t see any reason to run the Patreon differently. So note there isn\u0027t any exclusivity to the different levels available. The only reason different brackets exist is to give you the ability to choose an amount that fits you and your family best! Thanks again for stopping by!\u003cbr\u003e"
