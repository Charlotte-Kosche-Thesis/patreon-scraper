We are so grateful for you!\u00a0 Whether you decide to help financially or offer spiritual support, we just want to say THANK YOU for your shared passion, encouragement and prayers! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://scontent-atl3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13043788_1590976071192940_7287239018959266220_n.jpg?oh=419ad3f2bab09927ad2c8d094135dba8\u0026amp;oe=5AE80C9B\" style=\"width: 299px;\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMY EXPERIENCE WITH YOUTUBE\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe most important things in my life are sharing the Gospel of Jesus Christ and loving my family. I started a YouTube channel a number of years ago as a platform to share music and get the word out about projects that I was working on with friends.\u00a0 As the channel slowly grew, I also started to share sermons, family moments and other content and soon saw this is a great opportunity to share more on the Christian faith and apologetics.\u00a0 I created a video that challenged misconceptions about Christianity and it quickly grew to 1000s and 10s of thousands of views!\u00a0 I received comments and inboxes about how the video was helpful and even some testimonials about how some had reconsidered leaving the church after watching and researching the things that were discussed.\u00a0 It was beyond humbling and brought me to tears and a crystal clear realization; In a very internet and social media-driven time such as this, this platform is one key avenue to reaching into the new digital \"town square\" to share the gospel with others who may otherwise not hear it. I saw this not as a replacement for the pulpit, but a digital extension and enhancement of it.\u00a0 I also found an incredible community of like-minded believers and found this to be an extremely helpful point of connection and encouragement.\u00a0 \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTURNING THE PAGES\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eAs the passion for this ministry has grown -- from YouTube to a Facebook group called Reclaiming Christianity, to collaborations with other brilliant men and women of God with a similar calling\u00a0-- so did the need to put these things in writing.\u00a0 Reclaiming Christianity suddenly leapt from the FB page to the written page.\u00a0 Because of the gravity of this topic and the fact that it would be so highly scrutinized, I didn\u0027t want to approach such an important endeavor half-heartedly.\u00a0 I wanted to pour everything I had into it.\u00a0 All the researching and fact-checking and anticipation of objections and rebuttals...I wanted to cover all the bases.\u00a0 That project is still ongoing and one that is very dear to my heart.\u00a0 I eagerly await its birthday.\u00a0\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTHEN SOMEONE RECOMMENDED PATREON!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eOne Christian YouTuber that I followed talked at great length about how YouTube was starting to demonetize videos with Christian content on it, and how he had discovered this new platform called Patreon.\u00a0 Through this new site, he was able to continue to make awesome content and was able, through the partnership and support of others who were passionate about this assignment, to dedicate more time, effort, technical upgrades and professionalism to his ministry.\u00a0 He suggested that this was a great way of getting the word out about projects and sharing areas where others who might want to help in the effort.\u00a0 So...here we are!\u00a0 We set this page up not just to ask for financial support, but also for prayer warriors to keep us undergirded with prayer and warfare.\u00a0 We know we don\u0027t just fight against flesh and blood.\u00a0 For those led by God to do so, with your prayers support, we will be able to create higher quality content more frequently that will reach more people with the Gospel, as well as double our efforts to produce written material.\u00a0 And because it\u0027s supported by those of like mind and passion, we can continue this calling without any limitations on placed on free speech or compromise. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eTIME FOR SOUND INVESTMENT\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAround the same time all of this was going on, God gave us the vision for Investiny, a hub for information, inspiration, connection and consulting; to help others discover, focus on and invest into their God-given vision and destiny.\u00a0 More on that soon!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0I praise God daily for placing this work in my heart, and I can\u0027t thank you enough for your generous consideration to support this work through Patreon. Much love to you all and God Bless!"
