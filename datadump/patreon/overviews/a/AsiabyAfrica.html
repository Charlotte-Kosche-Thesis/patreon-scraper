Two largest opportunities.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h4\u003e\u003cdiv\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThose are the guiding ideas behind \u003ca href=\"http://www.asiabyafrica.com\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAsia by Africa\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and my \nwriting on the surprising ways the world\u0027s two most dynamic regions are \ninteracting. Hi, my name is Jeremy Luedi and I invite you to join me every week as we explore under-reported political, cultural, economic, and historical tales showcasing this dynamic relationship. \u003cstrong\u003eA new story awaits you every Sunday.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTQ8zMH35wc\u0026amp;feature=youtu.be\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s an in-depth explanation about how Patreon works\u003c/a\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWith so much going on its a shame that the news only reports the same half-dozen trending stories about each region. We\u0027ve all read a hundred cookie-cutter articles about China\u0027s influence in Africa, and frankly they\u0027re boring. This is where Asia by Africa comes in, delivering long form stories you\u0027ve never heard about or new angles on ones you thought you knew inside and out. Come with me as we journey from Point A to Point A in our \neponymous feature series.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor instance, have you hear about African football slaves in Southeast Asia? Or how Bollywood conquered the hearts of Nigerians? Did you know that Africa is quickly becoming the largest market for traditional Chinese medicine? Or that without South Africa, Iran would not have a nuclear program?\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThese are just some of my recent articles that you can find on my sleek, modern site, complete with custom infographics and engaging photos that enrich your reading experience.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt is often hard to find writing that is both engaging and reliable, and in the era of fake news, you may rightly wonder who I am. I started writing on a regular basis five years ago and currently work as a freelance writer and editor. \u003ca href=\"http://www.jeremyluedi.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMy writing\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e on Asia and Africa has appeared in The Diplomat, Japan Times, Business Insider, Yahoo Finance, Asia Times, Qrius, and Seeking Alpha. My work has also been quoted by OZY, TIME, and The Washington Times, among others.\u003cbr\u003e"
