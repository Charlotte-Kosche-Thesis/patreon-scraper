Some game architects do this with voice acting or deep story arcs, but we\u0027ve always done it with visual reference material. From characters to items to battlemaps, we developed the setting of our games by creating imagery that would give players a reference point to spark their imagination.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe are now using Patreon to help supplement our efforts to make our visual resources available to other players and game architects. Due to distribution restrictions and in order to reach a wide audience, all of our materials are now sold through Wizard\u0027s of the Coast\u0027s \"Dungeon Master\u0027s Guild\" platform. Those that contribute to our efforts and help us offset production costs by pledging here on our Patreon page not only enable us to set a low cost for those items, but also are rewarded with the ability to request custom character or scene depictions that will be uniquely theirs.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003eWe use Patreon\u0027s monthly charge system so if you are an established supporter, you\u0027ll be charged your pledge at the beginning of each month. \u003cstrong\u003eIF YOU ARE A FIRST TIME PLEDGER - Patreon will charge you as soon as your press the button\u003c/strong\u003e and then at the beginning of the month thereafter.

All of our content is high resolution and easily printed on cardstock (magical item cards) or poster-sized paper (maps).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eHere\u0027s a few examples of the kinds of things we\u0027ll be putting up on the Dungeon Master\u0027s Guild:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Weapon-Models.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Character-Portraits.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Character-Models.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-City-Maps.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Town-Maps.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Dungeon-Tiles.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Rural-Maps.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Monster-Tokens.jpg\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Building-Interiors.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Mineral-Props.jpg\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://acrpg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/ACrpg-Herbalism-Props.jpg\"\u003e"
