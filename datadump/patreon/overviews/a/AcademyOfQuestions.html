We strive to make challenging ideas and concepts more accessible and approachable. The goal is to generate curiosity. If our audience is driven to do additional research because of a video then we will have succeeded. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWho is Academy Of Questions?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eFounder - Jeremy Dance. Voice over talent - Josh Dance. We are working on bringing in other talent such as audio production by Graham Haerther. The team will most likely expand soon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHow much content can we expect from you?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eThat depends on audience support. Right now I work as hard as I can creating videos in between my other job. To maintain the standard of quality I strive for that means about 1 video every other month. When I can afford to hire a team you can expect one video a month consistently, until then I\u2019m working as hard as I can to close the gap between my current rate of production and one video a month.\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIs it your full time job?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"\u003eNo, but that is the goal. It would be a dream come true to work on the channel full time. However, with a baby coming soon I\u2019m going to keep my side job until I can generate enough income to make the switch. My hope is that I\u2019ll be able to switch within the next year. However that all depends on how much support I can generate. \u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
