    "summary": "Hello there, I\u0027m Brian. I record and release music as\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://milieumusic.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMilieu\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e,\u003cstrong\u003e\u00a0\u003c/strong\u003e\u003ca href=\"http://coppicehalifax.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCoppice Halifax\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e and (surprise) just\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://briangrainger.bandcamp.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBrian Grainger\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/a\u003e, among many other names. Since 2004, I\u0027ve issued over \u003cem\u003esix-hundred\u003c/em\u003e albums \u0026amp; EPs, most of which were assembled and released independently, and since 2007 I\u0027ve been lucky enough to call music-making my full-time job. In addition to generating a large catalog of my own work, I have a long-running mastering and design service (\u003ca href=\"http://www.analogbotany.com/\"\u003eAnalog Botany M\u0026amp;D\u003c/a\u003e), where other artists and labels can affordably use my ears to fine-tune their own materials. I also do scoring/soundtrack work for video games (\u003ca href=\"http://www.eufloria-game.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEufloria\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.omni-labs.com/eufloria-adventures/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eEufloria Adventures\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://zen.gansrigler.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eZEN\u003c/a\u003e), nature films (\u003ca href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1805270/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDiscovery Channel\u003c/a\u003e,\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDPFR6n8tAQ\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ePBS\u003c/a\u003e) and all manner of other media-based art forms. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor several years of the last decade, I\u0027ve routinely logged close to \u003cem\u003e80 hours a week\u003c/em\u003e doing what I do. That isn\u0027t a complaint - I \u003cstrong\u003elove\u003c/strong\u003e what I do, and I love that I can do it \u003cem\u003eat all\u003c/em\u003e, but many times it is very much a labor of love, and there are never \u003cem\u003eany\u003c/em\u003e guarantees of records sold, mastering and scoring work coming in or even breaking even on my material costs to operate. I\u0027ve equated working full-time in the creative arts to \"pushing a snowball up a hill, in Hell\", as the job can be unpredictable, stressful and sometimes even hopeless. Yet, I keep returning to the work all the same, because creating things is simply \u003cem\u003ewhat I do and who I am\u003c/em\u003e, and even when the business side of that work becomes overwhelming, it is still very worthwhile. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs with many creatives, life as a self-employed artist is hardly a glamorous one, and is often \"feast or famine\", with a very hand-to-mouth existence of continually trying to simply break even on costs and pay your bills every month. I\u0027d been asked about starting a Patreon page before by a few supporters, and having looked into it, now I am here. This page is an attempt to connect in a more personal way with my supporters, many of whom have been with me for up to ten years (you know who you are, \u003cstrong\u003ethank you\u003c/strong\u003e) and are somehow \u003cem\u003estill\u003c/em\u003e not exhausted by my prolificity. It is another option for helping me keep this creative vessel afloat through the turbulent times, and especially relevant for those who want to help my creative operation, but don\u0027t necessarily want to buy lots of records each month either. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003ePerhaps you\u0027d come see me if I toured and performed live in your town? Or perhaps you\u0027d buy a t-shirt if I had any for sale? Maybe you heard my work in a video game or a nature documentary and you wanted to pass on some appreciation for it. Maybe you just really like my beard, and would feel sad if I got a 9-to-5 and had to cut it off. Jokes aside, Patreon will allow me to be supported by all kinds of people, who appreciate my work in many different capacities, even if I cannot go out on a tour or sell t-shirts. It will, hopefully, provide me with some added financial stability that I can use to pay a bill each month, or buy groceries or gasoline, or even handle incidental things now that I have a 6-year old daughter (and trust me, kids have \u003cem\u003ea lot\u003c/em\u003e of incidentals). The more stability I have with the mundane stuff like that, the more time and energy I\u0027ll have to focus on doing what we both \u003cem\u003ereally\u003c/em\u003e want me to do - create, share and grow in the process. It will exist alongside my current duties as a musician, record label owner and mastering guru, and the more help I get here on Patreon, the better things will get in my creative process. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor a job without many guarantees of income or success, Patreon will give me some assuredness of financial reliability - assuredness that I haven\u0027t had since I was giving myself an ulcer processing claims for military insurance. So thank you, thank you so much for helping me do what I love and survive while I do it. Every little bit goes a long way, as they say, and once this page gets going I\u0027m going to do my very best to make it worthwhile for everyone involved. I have some ideas for exclusive music, giveaways and even in-studio insights on my whole process, which might be of interest to those of you who wonder just how all of this music comes from \u003cem\u003ejust one\u003c/em\u003e person!"
