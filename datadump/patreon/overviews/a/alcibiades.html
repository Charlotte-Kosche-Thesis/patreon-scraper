I have over 13 years of painting experience and I\u0027m constantly striving to learn more. I\u0027ve worked in pastel, oil paint, acrylic, watercolor, gouache, screenprint, woodblock, graphite, digital media, and more. My passion is painting figurative work - which is to say that I love to paint people, especially portraiture. I get a special satisfaction from capturing likenesses. I make fanart as well as original work. I\u0027m a semi-realist; I guess all in all, I\u0027m kind of old-school in a decidedly new-school world. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cimg src=\"http://68.media.tumblr.com/eec14a217a653ad6af18979768f8315a/tumblr_o69lpz1uYb1qcxx7lo1_500.png\"\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhy should I support you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cdiv style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003eIf you like my artwork and want to enable me to keep creating it and create more!
