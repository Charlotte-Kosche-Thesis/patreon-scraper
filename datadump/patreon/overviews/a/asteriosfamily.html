    "summary": "Hello, everyone. We\u0027re Meriweather and Lillian Asterios. Husband and wife. Authors and artists. We\u0027ve been writing together and making art together since we met four years ago. \u00a0We\u0027ve co-authored the dark fantasy series, The \u003cstrong\u003eBooks of Belshalara\u003c/strong\u003e. We\u0027ve published two in the series so far and are almost ready to release the third. We\u0027ve released the books to very positive reviews!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn order to keep creating, we have to pay our bills. I think that goes without saying. The starving artist thing is only cute when you don\u0027t have a car payment, kids and other adult obligations. Boo, adulting! So, after a bunch of people telling us to make one of these, we\u0027ve caved.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe plan on offering a lot of content to our patrons. We\u0027re currently writing a sitcom for youtube. Kind of a horror comedy, along with our roommate and vastly talented writer, Madalyn Singer. We fund all our projects ourselves from revenue from our art and writing and a little extra would really help move things along. We\u0027re SO excited to share this with you guys! It\u0027s a family driven project. Everyone is participating, including our friends.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEvery little bit helps \u003c/strong\u003etoo. And we\u0027re so grateful for the support we\u0027ve had so far. It\u0027s hard to even write this without getting really emotional. I consider all of you my friends, heck, my family. Merris and I don\u0027t have many people in our corner where we live, so we have really relied on the support we\u0027ve had from FB, instagram and other social media platforms. It keeps us going, even when times have been hard. \u003cstrong\u003eWe really love and appreciate all of you \u003c/strong\u003eand talk about you, think about you often...do you feel stalked yet? Ha! \u003cstrong\u003eBut seriously, thank you thank you thank you.\u003c/strong\u003e"
