I want you to do it gladly, with joy, simply because you know, deep down, that I deserve it. xoxo\u003cbr\u003e\n\u003cbr\u003e\n***\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cbr\u003epls note reward levels may change in future if Intuition tells me to do so\u00a0\u003cbr\u003ealso pls note that i\u0027m basically gonna listen to Intuition about what to put at what levels, unless like I specifically spell it out in the rewards :) ILY\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u003cem\u003eWhy Patreon?\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Patreon allows me to explore a lot of art that I want to put out there, but with privacy, and also to separate my fans, friends, family and those who genuinely love me from stalkers, obsessives, haters, and internet riff-raff. PATREON ALLOWS ME TO BE FREAKY AND FREE AND KNOW THAT ONLY PPL WHO LOVE ME ARE WATCHING\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u003cem\u003eWill there be sexy stuff?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eA: DUH, but not, like, full-on adult content. I MIGHT TAKE MY SHIRT OFF THO or like read you my poems or even like ASMR for the hell of it. But mostly it would be advocating for victims and body acceptance and gender fluidity.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u003cem\u003eI\u0027m a guy, is this for me?\u00a0\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA: Well, no one can answer that but you, but in general the answer is no, it\u0027s not. In this space women are given primacy as the audience, and if you can handle that, you\u0027ll probably learn a lot: I certainly did once I had to give women primacy as an audience. The exception is boys club, but even there, guys: this isn\u0027t about you.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eQ: \u003cem\u003eWho the hell are you?\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003eA: OMG so glad you asked.
