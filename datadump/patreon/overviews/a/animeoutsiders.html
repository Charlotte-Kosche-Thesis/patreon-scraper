    "summary": "Anime Outsiders is a brand new website offering podcasts and written features based on geek culture, with an emphasis on anime and its fandom. But wait, there\u0027s a catch! Anime podcasts and blogs are a dime a dozen, but let\u0027s face it; they\u0027re all pretty much the same. Some meek guy who watches every anime that comes out each season buys himself a headset and records him and some other friend that\u0027s just as uncharismatic as he is talking about what animes they like. Or you get some blog where a guy covers it in pictures of smiling anime girls with dot-noses, or shonen protagonists with intense expressions, talking about how much better his taste in Japanese cartoons is than everyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThis is not that kind of network.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnime Outsiders provides a perspective that geekdom has sorely needed; Anime fans that reject the \"otaku\" subculture. A group of people who love their geeky hobbies, haven\u0027t become completely obsessed with them, and offer entertaining and humorous insight into the anime medium. An opposing voice to the echochamber of the anime fandom, seeking to dismantle every one of their \"bully-proof windows\" and \"troll-safe doors\". AO focuses on casting a comedic and critical spotlight on the ridiculous aspects of anime and its fandom, while celebrating series that deserve praise and recognition. \u00a0Rather than trying to stand out through contrarianism, Anime Outsiders boasts witty and insightful commentary from its team of contributors who promote basic standards in anime, and its fans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eCurrent Anime Outsiders hosts the following:\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe Other Side:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe site\u0027s flagship podcast, described as the shock jocks of anime podcasts. Absolutely not for the easily offended, The Other Side has gained a level of infamy within anime podcasting circles for the raw, biting commentary of its hosts. Each week TOS highlights a different subject in anime for discussion, leading to humorous observations and plenty of blue humor. You won\u0027t find any anime podcast like this on the internet! Serving as a breath of fresh air from the meek and/or awkward nature of most anime podcasts, The Other Side brings you three friends shooting the shit about anime and getting some laughs--sometimes at it, sometimes with it, most of the time at it. The show is hosted by Cody Baier, with Max \"Vader\" and Andrew Erickson serving as the current co-hosts.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eDean Talks Anime:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eA written feature on the site by Christopher \"Dean the Adequate\" Kinsey, in which an old-timer discusses some of the anime fandom\u0027s roots, origins of anime tropes and genres, obscure anime magazines and merch that time forgot, and much, much more. Being a mix of educational and entertaining, Dean Talks Anime is an excellent read for young and old fans alike! Weather it\u0027s insight into a genre that\u0027s close to your heart, or learning about how people got their manga fix before modern print volumes were even a thing, DTA is always an interesting read!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAndrew in Steamland:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSome time ago on The Other Side, a challenge was issued by Cody Baier to send co-host Andrew Erickson horrible games on Steam because he has an almost obsessive-compulsive need to complete any game he owns. Maybe he\u0027s just addicted to Steam Achievements, who knows... Well, lots of people decided to take Cody up on that challenge and send Andrew heaps of absolute gaming garbage. So what better way to get something out of it than to make a featured article on it? Andrew in Steamland focuses on Andrew\u0027s exploits through these terrible games, each article focusing on another terribad, or flat-out bizarre, Steam game. Through this feature, we can follow Andrew\u0027s descent into madness together!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe also offer reviews of current anime series, as well as obscure titles and classic series, held up to rigorous standards. Having been thoroughly unsatisfied with the way anime titles are reviewed by other outlets, Anime Outsiders has set a strict standard for reviews, ensuring that each review is insightful, reliable, and stands up to even the toughest scrutiny. While the nature of most of the site is comedic, and often lowbrow, AO\u0027s reviews are done with utmost professionalism to ensure that people can finally have a site for anime reviews they can trust!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eWhere does your money go?\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs the site expands, more features and new podcasts will be added. And that\u0027s where you come in! The money made by this Patreon campaign does not only to compensate the AO staff, but toward the site itself. Improved recording equipment for our podcasters; new features for the website; hiring people to help work on the site, or create new and improved graphics for it; the list goes on. As our funding increases, we will be updating all Patrons on what their money is going toward. If you like us enough to donate your hard-earned money, we will do everything we can to ensure you it is all going to the right place. We believe in transparency!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe thank you for your support!"
