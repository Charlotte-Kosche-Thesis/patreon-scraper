    "summary": "Hello! First of all, thank you for taking the time to check out my Patreon page! Many of you have followed me all the way back to my dancing days, through my porn career, and now into my comedy career. I have picked up so many wonderful fans throughout the years, and I want to thank you all for your support and encouragement. All you keep me going and help me stay on track with my goals. But I have soooo many goals, and I need some help.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany of you have offered to buy me things on a \"wish list,\" and that has never really been my thing. I don\u0027t need people to buy me stuff, but I could use your help in obtaining some of my goals with cold hard cash, which is much more productive and fulfilling than crystal candle holders. Even though I do love me some crystal candle holders. I digress....\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI do a lot of stuff. Like a lot. I am currently working on my bachelor\u0027s in forensic psychology. I want to get my masters in clinical sexology. I also want to get my Ph.D. in forensic sexology. I have a 4.0GPA; I am a member of 5 international and national honor societies, as well as on the Dean\u0027s List. These goals are not cheap, and I do not have any student loans. None. This is not easy.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am also taking acting classes at the Barrow Group in NYC. It\u0027s an excellent school, and I am learning so much. Taking these classes helps give me an advantage in my field and can help me progress a little faster.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eLast but not least in the education department, I am taking self-defense classes. Being a woman is tough. Being a woman that has done porn can be a littler harder sometimes. Living in New York City and being a woman can be like walking through a minefield. Even with the police training, I have had it is important to keep the muscle memory active to ensure my safety. And I like being safe.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am the creator, owner, and operator of a podcast network, \u003ca href=\"http://themisfitsnetwork.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eThe Misfits Network\u003c/a\u003e. I also created, own and produce comedy shows with my comedy production company, \u003ca href=\"http://hardcorecomedyentertainment.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eHardcore Comedy Entertainment\u003c/a\u003e. I am also the creator, producer, and co-host the \u003ca href=\"http://whormonespodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eWhormones Podcast\u003c/a\u003e with Jaqi Furback. And let\u0027s not forget my own website, \u003ca href=\"http://aliajanine.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAliaJanine.com\u003c/a\u003e. Basically, I\u0027m a webmaster to 4 websites, producer and editor of a podcast and a podcast network, a stand-up comedy show producer and booker, social media manager, I am working on a comedy column for a popular adult magazine (can\u0027t say yet!), I am also working on a book, and last but not least I perform stand-up comedy a minimum of 5 times a week.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eDid I mention I have dogs? Yes, plural, two of them. They are amazingly needy bundles of fur and love.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe money earned through my Patreon account will be going towards my education, acting and self-defense classes, monthly and annual website fees and maintenance, travel, promotional items, dog sitters, podcast equipment, sketches, photo shoots, possibly a part-time assistant so I can not work on something for 5 seconds, and maybe a couple dog bones here and there for my girls. Your patronage is very special and important to me, and I cannot thank you enough!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
