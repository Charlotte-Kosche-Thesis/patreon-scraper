     "about": "I\u0027ve wanted to fly for as long as I can remember. Subscribed to Flying Magazine when I was 9 or 10. Worked at FBOs in high school and college. Attended Georgia Tech my \"starter year\" of college, then transferred to Auburn University, where I studied Electrical Engineering and Aviation Management. Two weeks after I graduated, I was being sworn in to the United States Air Force. After graduating from Undergraduate Pilot Training in Columbus, MS, I flew the C-141B Starlifter, and then the T-37 basic jet trainer as an instructor pilot. While serving in the Air Training Command, I was a Wing Safety Officer, and received certification as an aircraft accident investigator from the University of Southern California Institute of Safety and Systems Management.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAfter seven years of service in the USAF, I was hired by a large international \"legacy\" airline. I have been flying for them for more than 29 years, 18 of them as captain. The aircraft I\u0027ve flown thus far at \"Acme\" (a pseudonym for my actual airline) include the Boeing B-727, the Lockheed L-1011, and most recently the McDonnell Douglas MD-88 and MD-90.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI am married (35 years), and have three children. In addition to my passion of flying, I also enjoy playing the trumpet and piano (not at the same time, though), and singing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e",
