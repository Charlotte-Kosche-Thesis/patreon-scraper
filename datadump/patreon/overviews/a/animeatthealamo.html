Without you, there is no possible way we could have lasted this long, thank you so much!!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs we head into this new era, we are faced with many new challenges.

Yes you! When we all pitch in, many hands can make light work of any challenge! Consider signing up for one of the subscription tiers listed here on our patreon page!

You\u0027ll be able to keep up with us as we grow our event, and as we reach our goals - additional events, meetups, and screenings can gradually be added to our schedule in places all over san antonio!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eRemember, when you contribute to our cause, you\u0027re not just helping fund an Anime Night just for yourself, you\u0027re also helping to provide a place to belong for many others within your own community! \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eFor all those young fans, coming up in the world with no place to be themselves. \u00a0For parents who want a place to connect with their kids (\u003cem\u003eno matter their age!\u003c/em\u003e). For the awesome service men and women who might be new to town, but looking for other friendly people that share their hobbies. This is for them too!\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo what are you waiting for?
