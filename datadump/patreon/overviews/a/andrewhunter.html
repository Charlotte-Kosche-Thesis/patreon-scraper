My name is Andrew Hunter, author of the Songreaver\u0027s Tale series of fantasy books.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/strong\u003eYou can learn more about the series on my website \u003ca href=\"http://www.freemancer.com/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFreemancer.com\u003c/a\u003e, or pick up the eBooks over at \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IBR2THU?ref=series_rw_dp_labf\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eAmazon!\u003c/a\u003e The books follow the adventures of a young man named Garrett, caught up in a war between the followers of the God of War and the Goddess of Death. Pulled from the ashes of his home, he finds himself surrounded by zombies, vampires, and ghouls... and they\u0027re the good guys! Where will he go from here? I have no idea, but I was hoping that you might help me find out...\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBeing an independent writer is tough.\u003c/strong\u003e I mean, not just for the obvious reasons, but also because you\u0027re making it all up as you go along. You have no publisher to bounce ideas off of, or on-call editor to give you feedback on the latest draft... It\u0027s just you and the voices in your head, and they\u0027re terrible at giving constructive criticism or holding you to your daily word count.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eIn short, I\u0027m lonely.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027ve been writing the Songreaver\u0027s Tale for almost a decade now, and the only feedback I ever get is from whatever friends and family I can convince to Beta Read for me, and then the occasional online review or bit of fan mail from my readers, most of whom remain to me something of a nameless, faceless abstraction, somewhere out there in the aether.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eI want to get to know you better.\u003c/strong\u003e I want to hear your ideas and concerns and find out what you like best about my writing. I want to know your favorite characters and your biggest questions about Garrett\u0027s world, a world that began as a daydream when I was scrubbing buckets in the necropsy lab back in college.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eNow, with \u003cstrong\u003ePatreon\u003c/strong\u003e, a writer like me can partner more directly with his readers. At least that\u0027s what I\u0027m hoping to do here, if you\u0027re up for it. \u003cstrong\u003eSo, come along for the ride, and let\u0027s see where the story takes us next.\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI hope it\u0027s to Zhad. I hear they have really good pastries there.\u003cbr\u003e"
