I create photo realistic paintings and drawings in oil, acrylic and pencil media from photos.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAlthough my favorite subject is classic Hollywood film stars, I also make paintings of family, floral pieces, still life subjects, pets and property such as classic cars and architecture. As a former engineer, I employ a few traditional techniques used by some of the old masters, paying attention to fine detail and spatial relations as they apply to art.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe ongoing goal of my Patreon page is to bring you, my patrons, new and vibrant art pieces in the realist style. For those of you who\u0027ve seen my work before, these pieces will be the kind you\u0027ve come to know but with more experimentation of methods and materials as I illustrate various techniques. For those of you new to my works, you\u0027ll be treated to some eye-catching photo realism!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eYour Patreon rewards give you access to the\u00a0\"tangibles\" of Artangibles:\u00a0 downloadable finished artwork images for your desktop and smart phone, how-to lessons \u0026amp; tutorials to follow whenever you want, and behind-the-scenes videos of my studio workflow and processes.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThanks and enjoy!\u003cbr\u003e- \u003cem\u003eCheryl Williams\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
