My blog is\u00a0\u003ca href=\"http://www.alden-tan.com\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewww.Alden-Tan.com\u003c/a\u003e. I started out writing about... ugh, self-help, a term I\u0027ve grown to hate.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI began with all the lofty dreams of working from home, being my own boss, making money online, all the while writing at home wearing only my underwear.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThe journey has taken a toll on me mentally, emotionally and financially.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI kept chasing the money by learning internet marketing i.e. the sales process. I ignored my art, my writing.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI learnt about \"niches\" and ended up writing about stupid shit I didn\u0027t care about.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made money by doing things that made me deeply uncomfortable, like promoting affiliate products I knew were crap.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI got scammed before by so-called coaches and mentors.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBut what got me down the most is the hypocrisy in the self-help world.

I am not trying to wax lyrical or gain sympathy points here. I really do enjoy helping others with my writing and I feel I have the ability to do so.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBut no, I do not want to use tactics or focus on the process of marketing to get your attention.

As said, being an artist is something I take pride in and I don\u0027t wish to compromise my values.

That was utterly ridiculous.\u003c/li\u003e\u003cli\u003eStretch marketing tactics to the lowest common denominator just to appear like they\u0027re doing something ethical.

I\u0027ve seen too much scammy bullshit online and it irks me to know that most people can\u0027t see through the veil because the scammers are just so good at what they do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThis is something I strongly believe in:\u003c/strong\u003e I want to write to inspire and help others in an honest and authentic way without any bullshit. I want to show people that this can be done and that artists worldwide can make an honest living without having to shirk their values and principles.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003ci style=\"font-weight: bold;\"\u003e\"But don\u0027t you think sometimes we\u0027ve got to make do?

Everyone has their own way of doing things and I respect that.

It is also, if you will, a homage to my father and the life I had with him.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAnd sure enough, I am looking to make a living out of it in my own terms through a healthy balance here on Patreon.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eBesides, to be honest, when I threw aside my values and applied all the scammy tactics before, it turned me into a very tired, demoralized, confused and angry person. I would often question myself in front of the computer, \"Why the hell am I doing this shit? Why am I not writing?\" \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI made a lot of money online before, but it didn\u0027t make me happy.

Fans pay a few bucks per month OR \u003cem\u003eper post \u003c/em\u003eyou release, and then you get paid every month, or every time you release something new. Learn more about becoming a creator on Patreon \u003ca href=\"https://www.patreon.com/become-a-patreon-creator\"\u003eHERE\u003c/a\u003e.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFor patrons\u003c/strong\u003e, Patreon is a way to join your favorite creator\u0027s community and pay them for making the stuff you love. Instead of \u003cem\u003eliterally\u003c/em\u003e throwing money at your screen (trust us, that doesn\u2019t work), you can now pay a few bucks \u003cem\u003eper month \u003c/em\u003eor \u003cem\u003eper post\u003c/em\u003e that a creator makes.  For example, if you pay $2 per video, and the creator releases 3 videos in February, then your card gets charged a total of $6 that month.  This means the creator gets paid regularly (every time she releases something new), and you become a bonafide, real-life patron of the arts.  That\u2019s right--Imagine \u003cem\u003eyou\u003c/em\u003e, in a long frilly white wig, painted on a 10-foot canvas on the wall of a Victorian mansion.
