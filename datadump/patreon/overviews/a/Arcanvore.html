    "summary": "\u003cstrong\u003eHello everyone and thank you so much for taking the time out\nto look at my Patreon page!\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nMy name is Nathan and I am an aspiring Professional Game Master.\nIt is surreal to be writing this right now. My love for Role Playing Games (RPGs)\nbegan when I was a teenager more than twenty years ago. More recently I have\nbecome more committed to the craft. I currently spend 3 nights a week Dungeon\nMastering for 3 groups of players Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, on Roll20.Net.\nI strive to make the game a potent blend of technical solutions, an encyclopedic\nvariety of monster cards and content, and immersive community of over 29\nmembers to help comprise an even more immersive game world which I hope\ncontinues to grow. I strive to make every game session involve role play, crunchy\nencounters, and collaboration.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo why have a Patreon account? Why encourage people to pay\nfor a Dungeon Master? First and Foremost, my games are free! But, to be\nconsidered a Professional is simply a giant honor. Someone once told me, that you\ncan\u2019t be a professional, no matter what you are doing, unless there is an\nincome involved. Tipping me makes me a professional DM, and that is my dream to\nbecome. It may not be a high paying profession, but it truly something that I\nlove to do. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nAll I ask if I have given you the same amount of\nentertainment as say one movie rental from RedBox each week , that you would\nconsider throwing a tip within your means in the Dungeon Master\u2019s Bag of\nHolding one in a blue moon. If I have been your DM for over six months at a\ngiven rate of 4 hours per week, that is some 104 hours of \u201cEntertainment\u201d in\nthe form of Table Top Roleplaying games. So if that means anything to you, tip\nme $5. I would love to be able to gain a tiny residual income for sitting down\nat the table with you and our fellow heroes, crafting epic stories and sharing\nunforgettable moments. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWithout this Patreon page I currently am in the position of\nentertaining five people, three nights a week with all costs incurred out of\npocket. To be honest I do this for the love of the game, so I am not going to\ntalk too much about the costs of running the game. But I would like to make you\naware of them in case you never considered it.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eDigital Art Library\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nI currently have spent over $100.00 on Digital Art on the\nRoll 20 Market place. This is so that I can make the game feel as professional as\npossible. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eOfficial WOTC Content\non Roll20.Net \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nSo far I have tallied up $50.00, but I intend on getting\nmore content. As the most of you know I kinda write my own stuff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eGaming Amenities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n Guys I have a Blue\nYeti Microphone just so you all can hear me clearly. But I would love to\neventually get the equipment to record the audio and video of our session so\nthat we can look back at our adventures together and chronicle it all.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cstrong\u003eTime\u003c/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\n\nA bare minimum of 24 hours per week of my time is spent\nmanaging and developing my game world and group and player management. Time is\na resource after all.\u003cbr\u003e\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\nWell to be honest it is surreal to be here, but I am so\nelated to live in a world where all this is even possible.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you all for\nyour collaboration and your consideration.\u003cbr\u003e"
