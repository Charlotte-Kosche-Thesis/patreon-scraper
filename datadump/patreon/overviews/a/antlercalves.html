Because of Patrons like you, I am able to do this in the way I have dreamed of since I was a little writer, who thought a story about a blowfish going to the supermarket\u00a0or, later on,\u00a0really dramatic poems written to the sounds of My Chemical Romance was the ceiling of my talent. Writing has gotten me through\u00a0my entire life so far,\u00a0helped me deal with my PTSD \u0026amp; trauma episodes,\u00a0major anxiety disorder, manic-depressive episodes,\u00a0heartbreaks, losses, wins, self-discoveries about\u00a0my sexual orientation, gender expression, and what I really want to do with my incredibly short lifetime in this vast and infinite universe.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 Over a decade and four self-published books later, it\u0027s become clear to me that there is always more that a writer, a creator, an artist can do. As a writer, that thing that I can do is \u003cstrong\u003ewrite\u003c/strong\u003e and to write\u00a0things that hopefully mean something to someone--things that can be terrifying and revolting a times, things that can be painful and heart-wrenching, things that can be inspiring and give you warm-fuzzies, things that make you question what you like and don\u0027t like--and to show that no one is alone in this world, even when it\u0027s so dark you can\u0027t see anyone else.\u003cbr\u003e\u00a0 I write fiction, residing mostly in horror, science-fiction,\u00a0fantasy, romance/erotica, mystery, thriller, and character studies. All of my works\u00a0are LGBTQA+ inclusive.\u00a0\u003cem\u003e(All of my works will be tagged with any subject matters contained within that might be triggering for people, e.g. graphic descriptions of gore/death, any erotic situations,\u00a0mentions or descriptions of violence/abuse/drugs/etc.\u00a0and other things that might trigger someone. If you are a Patron and would like me to tag for something specific, do not hesitate to let me know! I want to explore the uncomfortable, unpleasant, and unhealthy, but you do not need to explore anything with me that you are not ready for.)\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eBecause of your continued support, I can keep doing what I love (writing)\u00a0and what, I hope, are intense stories for people who might be, like me and you and everyone I\u0027ve ever met, at least a little bit \u003c/strong\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cem\u003eoff.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eThank you.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/strong\u003e\u00a0 Mads Stokes\u003cbr\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u00a0 \u003ca href=\"http://antlercalves.wordpress.com\"\u003eantlercalves\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003cbr\u003e"
