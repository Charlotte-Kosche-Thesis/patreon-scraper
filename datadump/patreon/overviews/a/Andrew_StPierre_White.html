There are also a few that I\u0027ve disliked a lot. I\u0027ve always been infatuated about 4x4s and what they can do.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eSo thank you for sharing my world of 4x4s. It\u0027s these contributions that make it possible. Any support, no matter the amount, makes all the difference.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eAs a Patreon supporter you will receive an email the moment a new video is released and that means you\u0027ll be the first to see them, and no video will go missing. Up the contribution scale there are 4xO stickers, web chats, live broadcasts, and a whole lot more.

Most especially, overland exploration to amazing places. I\u0027ve made a good living editing TV commercials and directing documentaries for some big-name channels, but I\u0027m not doing that any more. In 2006 I made my first adventure travel TV series, and I\u0027ve come to realise that it\u0027s what I was put on this Earth for. I have already produced eight overland adventure travel TV seasons, and have my dream shoots being planned right now.\u003cbr\u003e",
