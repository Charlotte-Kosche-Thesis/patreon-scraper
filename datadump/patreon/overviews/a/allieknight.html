    "summary": "Life.. comes at you fast.\u003cbr\u003eOne minutes you\u0027re vagabonding around the country in a giant truck.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003eThe next you\u0027re settling into a townhouse with a dog and two kids.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe didn\u0027t write this plan down. It just kind of happened. Like hitting a brick wall. But, we\u0027re going to make the most of it. Fuel prices have become beyond affordable, and our budget got completely thrown under the RV this past summer (2017) - but we soldier on. Some days are a lot harder than others.\u003cbr\u003eSeptember of 2017, Allie suffered a complete burnout. Couple that with overwhelming pressure and life just generally getting in the way and there was a meltdown. Not a pretty one, but not a complete sh*t show either. Just a meltdown. She\u0027s on the mend, which is good. It\u0027s slow going, but we have goals. Big ones.\u003cbr\u003eFirst, we would love to get back to daily videos. Even if they\u0027re 5-10 minutes long. What those look like, and what kind of content they are, will be all over the map. We\u0027re currently working out a full schedule (which we will update here for you when we\u0027ve got it sorted.) Second, we are totally going to continue to travel. Right now we\u0027re trying to catch up the budget so we can afford fuel again. That is our biggest problem, budgeting. That and two kids. They make things fun, but also much more challenging to work around.\u003cbr\u003eSo what do you guys get in return for helping support this endeavor? For those that have stuck with us from the start, I have some special promos and products in the works for you. Your loyalty and patience will not be forgotten and will be heavily rewarded every step of the way.\u003cbr\u003eThose of you that are new to this journey or returning.. thank you. We appreciate all the support we can get. Your patronage goes directly into getting this dog and pony show back where it belongs.\u003cbr\u003eSo for now, this is my status update. Our \u0027rewards\u0027 will reflect what we can do for our patrons, as best we can. We want you to be part of our little crazy family! Come join us on Discord or Twitch for live interactions. Watch us on YouTube for more in depth coverage. Follow us on Twitter for inspiration and retweets. Whatever your style, we appreciate you being here with us.\u003cbr\u003e"
