    "summary": "Hi there. I\u0027m Goodbody Grieving, and if you\u0027re here it\u0027s either a grave and terrible mistake or you follow Atrocity Kitsch over on Facebook! Either way, let me awkwardly introduce myself.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eI\u0027m a Jack of all trades, having mastered exactly none of them: cosplay, makeup artistry and sfx, novel-writing, poetry and prose, comprehensive activist education, pithy remarks, and dedication to aestheticism bordering upon the frightening not least among them - which is all to say that I basically spend most of my time on the internet screaming about one thing or another, welcome to hell.\u00a0\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIn all seriousness, though? I really love to make things. I work ~42 hours a week, am in school or studying upwards of another ~45 hours a week, and mama may have raised an insecure neurotic mess of an artist but she sure as hell ain\u0027t raise no bitch, so I do my best to keep creating as long as I can. I \u003cem\u003eam\u003c/em\u003e\u00a0a broke bitch though, and it\u0027s an expensive process - especially where cosplay is concerned - so I could really use whatever help you want to offer and I\u0027ll try to make it worth your while along the way (wink wink, nudge nudge).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eEither way, thanks for clicking on the picture of my face (or the link that \u003cem\u003eled\u003c/em\u003e to the picture of my face) and reading the thing I wrote about other things.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003exoxo,\u003cbr\u003egood grief"
